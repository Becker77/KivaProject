She owns a business venture, running bingo games.  Evelini has many years of experience in this business.  Evelini needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase game prizes.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 tala or US $271 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nEvelini joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Evelini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Evelini S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20203050001) is a 53-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has three adult children.  To make a living, T. operates a family member's business raising cattle for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by T. from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. \r\n\r\nPresentacion is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 5th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":700022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bobongan, Ramon Magsaysay, Zamboanga del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-02-11T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Presentacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195851183},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201293433},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206162140},{"amount":93.53,"local_amount":3741.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4062.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211235201},{"amount":6.47,"local_amount":259,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":281.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216514059}],"funded_date":"2011-02-11T17:38:49Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":276224,"name":"Jenny Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Jenny Elizabeth, ella tiene 45 a\u00f1os, tiene 1 hijo menor de edad.

It is well known that Peru has the most delicious foods in the world, and one of Martha's favorite dishes is pork cracklings. She studied until the second year of secondary school and would have liked to study law. Martha is the single mother of four children who are 24, 21, 19, and 15 years old. They have all studied through the fourth year of secondary school.\n\nMartha is a merchant who has a bodega [small grocery store] where she sells staple goods. Martha works approximately ten hours a day. She was encouraged to open this type of business because there aren't many bodegas in the area where she lives, so she is able to average 15 customers a day, which brings in an average of approximately 40 nuevos soles per day. On a good day, she can earn up to 60 nuevos soles. Martha thinks her business is successful because she offers good quality products and treats her customers kindly. \n\t\nThis will help her to stock her bodega with a variety of products so that her customers will feel pleased with the merchandise offered.

A. is 47 years old. His civil status is married. Marcial has two children whose ages are the following: his eldest son is 18 years old and he's in his third year of his career studies and his younger son is 12 and he's in his first year of secondary school. His wife works in a hardware store. Their goals are to serve their customers since they provide the economic support through which they've survived with their family. Their desires are to establish a clothing store in which one will find a variety of merchandise such as clothing for women, men and children. Since, at this time, it is difficult to maintain such a business, he could manage it. Their dreams are to improve their living conditions. He would like to give his wife all the comforts she deserves, and his children so that they may have a fruitful future and not want for necessities.\r\n\r\nHis job is in general merchandise. His business is of the \"on foot\" nature. He's had this business for six years. Marcial began this business after he was laid off from his job at the Enel company, which at one time was part of the state and later was sold to a Spanish company that decided to cut personnel. He started with another business selling icy pops and ice cream. However, upon seeing the little earnings that it generated, he decided to incorporate sales of clothing on credit on foot.

P. is originally from the community of Coyol, municipality of Condega. He makes a living as an agricultural and livestock farmer on his own land. He is most active in livestock. He is requesting the loan to purchase fertilizers for his coffee crops, since a portion of his land is dedicated to coffee and he wants to cultivate it in the best way possible to make the most of it. Coffee is one of the main activities of Nicaraguans. He has been involved in the business since he was a young boy because his father also made a living off the same land. Juan Felipe learned from him, and today he doesn't have his father to count on but he will always work on the land that he left him. Juan Felipe also dedicates himself to other activities, such as cultivating basic grains and raising livestock, and he hopes that the loan will give him more opportunities to keep working and improving the conditions of his farm a little more each time. His goal is to leave a legacy for his children. Juan Felipe is married and has six children, two school age and four who are fully grown and no longer dependent on him but whom he always supports as a father. This is his sixth loan, and he has worked with Kiva partner Ceprodel since 2005. He expressed his gratitude for helping him improve his family's quality life, and he hopes to keep working with the same success with Kiva and Ceprodel.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":491405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers to maintain coffee crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Felipe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":20450.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195815500}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T05:15:28Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:30:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":181912,"name":"Bayasgalan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bayasgalan is 48 years old and lives with her husband and their four children in Arhangai province, Mongolia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

So to improve her rice production, Mrs. Sokha K. is asking for a loan to buy fertilizer, gasoline, and rice seed and to hire farm laborers to plow her rice field.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Film","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy some video screens so that she can start showing videos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T19:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahel F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T22:14:33Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970700},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886917},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436177},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130450},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027252},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613283},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010366},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232677},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664493},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50219.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105238}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T21:14:33Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":74648,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Samuel tiene 48 a\u00f1os, vive solo porque no tienes esposa ni hijos.

is 45 years old and married with four children, ages 8, 9, 10, and 12, and all of the children are attending school. He is a dairy farmer in the Nkubu area near Mount Kenya. He's been in this business for 15 years and sells fine beans, bananas, and milk to local brokers. Previously, he worked as the middle-man, buying bananas from farms and selling them in Nairobi. He says that the main challenge to his business are diseases that affect the dairy cow.<P>\r\n\r\nHe has successfully repaid two previous loans through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 20,000 and 45,000 and requested this loan for Kes. 70,000 to purchase a dairy cow. John says that the dairy cow will provide milk for his children to drink as well as income to help him provide an education for his children. In the future, he would like to expand his dairy farming with a better cow shed. <P>\r\n\r\nJohn added that loans from Juhudi have really helped because he has gotten both income and manure for his farm from the dairy cows.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout Juhudi Kilimo<P>\r\n\r\nJuhudi Kilimo is an innovative, for-profit social enterprise working with smallholder farmers in Kenya. Juhudi directly finances dairy cows, chickens, agricultural equipment, and other assets that are specifically chosen to create immediate cash flow.

For its clients and their families, Juhudi also offers life insurance and a medical aid program. Through all these services, Juhudi is creating sustainable growth and employment in rural communities across

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Like most Filipino parents, Nenita believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNenita operates an internet caf\u00e9 business. There is more need, now than before, for services like these as customers\u2019 demand increases. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements.

Aside from the internet caf\u00e9, Nenita is into direct selling. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 619 in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 29,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy an additional computer, mouse, keyboard, mouse pad, and other supplies for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNenita dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Mas adelante tiene proyectado comprar una camioneta m\u00e1s grande, para ir ampliando de este modo su negocio y sus ingresos.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":142171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of sugar, rice, flour, canned goods, housewares, and so forth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Luque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.266667 -57.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-03-25T14:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregorio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-11T22:58:25Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-04-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195427},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-05-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222634},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-06-29T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251843},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-07-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":280594},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-08-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T09:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":310225},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-09-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":341259},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:47:38Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5317996},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9936515},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860135},{"amount":110,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":504020,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20401492}],"funded_date":"2008-03-28T22:58:25Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:49:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45972,"name":"Sorie P.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sorie is 41 years old, married and has four children.

She has been in this business for 5 years, and the difficulties that she has faced have been in periods of low sales due to the difficult economic situation in the country.  She started this business with severance pay from her old job, all due to the attraction she felt for making mirrors, and she thought it could be a good business.  The use of this loan will be the purchase of supplies so she can make her mirrors.  She has large orders and doesn't have enough capital to satisfy the demand of her customers.

This is 32-year-old Lucy S. from Mbeya. She is married and has two children, aged 1 and 11. \r\n\r\nLucy has been running a shop since 2000. She buys commodities, such as soap salt, sugar, matches and other home supplies, wholesale and sells them retail. She works at her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Lucy currently earns about $140 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase more items in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the range of stock. Lucy thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more items in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy T.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling of bought gold dust to the local community. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for more than 19 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional working capital. Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP (US$175), which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan Jocelyn has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She delivers all her milk to a local company that processes dairy products and sells them in the local market. \r\n\r\nHer first loan was used to purchase a milking machine which made her work easier and more efficient. Now she hopes to get another loan to purchase another dairy cow to increase her production of raw milk. Lenny showed great responsibility in repaying her first loan and for that reason hopes the Kiva folks with trust her once again. She thanks all of those that helped and trusted her previously. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva

r\u00e1pido hasta quedarse sin existencia de algunos de ellos.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen, con ello conservar\u00eda un stock de mercanc\u00edas no perecederas,  como caf\u00e9, azucar, arroz, aceite, enlatados, refrescos y ahorrar\u00eda en precio  por la compra en volumen y tambi\u00e9n el transporte, adicionalmente teniendo productos que muy pronto terminan para no decir \u201cno hay\u201d a sus clientes. \nLuis inici\u00f3 su vida comercial hace 25 a\u00f1os  aproximadamente,  cuando proveniente de su natal zapoteca (departamento de Santander) se instal\u00f3 en la Costa caribe e inici\u00f3 como empleado de una tienda, despu\u00e9s se independiz\u00f3 en inici\u00f3 la distribuci\u00f3n de productos l\u00e1cteos en una bicicleta y agreg\u00f3 galleter\u00eda y confiter\u00eda, simult\u00e1neamente trabaj\u00f3 en tareas de la construcci\u00f3n, en una panader\u00eda hasta que recapitulando su experiencia, emprendi\u00f3 hace 7 meses su negocio de tienda con mucho \u00e9xito y por la aceptaci\u00f3n que tiene de su clientela en su nicho de mercado.

He lives with his wife and their four children who range in age from 12 to 18.  Housewives from the community and the surrounding areas come to his store to buy everyday items for their families such as snacks, food, beverages, groceries, and other items.  His customers know him and his products sell quickly to the point that he runs out of a few items.  For this reason he is requesting a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the funds to buy in large quantities so that he can maintain a stock of non-perishable goods such as coffee, sugar, rice, oil, canned foods, and soft drinks.  By purchasing in volume, Luis will be able to get a discount and also save on shipping costs.  In addition, by having more products in stock, he can stop saying \u201cWe\u2019ve run out\u201d to his customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuis started working approximately 25 years ago.  This native of Zapoteca, in the Department of Santander, moved to the Caribbean coast and started a job as a store clerk.  Afterwards, he became independent and started selling dairy products from a bicycle.  He also started selling candy and cookies while holding down other jobs working in construction and at a bakery so that he could gain experience.  Seven months ago, Luis opened his store with great success and a warm reception from the customers who make up his niche market.  Luis has the support of his family, especially from two of his children who have gained business experience while going to school.  His greatest wish is to one day leave them with a secure source of income so that they can work persistently and with discipline.  In the meantime, his current business is generating sales profitability of no less than 8.7% while his cost of sales is 84.1%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":822819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Apal has pursued this sphere, because she always knew how important health is and wanted to help make changes in people\u2019s lives. However, after the birth of her child, she realized this job couldn\u2019t earn enough to provide for her child's living expenses. So, in cooperation with her husband, she decided to try cattle breeding. And she wasn\u2019t mistaken. Soon Apal bought her first calves for 5 000 soms, fattened and resold them at a good deal. Now she applied for a loan from Kiva to buy some more livestock for further breeding and reselling.

He would like to add more variety to the goods he offers in his store, but he is lacking the capital to make the bulk purchases.

Helen is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 14th loan taken out by Helen from PMPC.

She is married and has 6 school-aged children.  To make a living, Lalotea operates a fishing business.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Lalotea has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 650 Samoan tala (about $246 US)  a month from these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2005, Lalotea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lalotea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase a fishing boat.  Lalotea is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be her third from SPBD.  Lalotea plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":366760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Dellilah has 3 years of experience in this business.  Dellilah needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dellilah joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Dellilah's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Dellilah M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has received senior high education.  Elizabeth prepares palm oil for sale at Abura. To prepare her locally made palm oil, she gets her palm nuts from the farmers at their farms.\n\nShe washes them then boils them for a while until they become tender. She scoops the cooked fruit into a big mortar and pounds gently with a pestle so as not to damage the nut. She then adds water to the pounded fruit. The pounded fruit is squeezed and filtered to get the juice out and remove the chaff. (The chaff can be used to light charcoal fires).The juice boils again and the fresh oil floats to the surface of the pot. It is scooped into yet another pot to cool.

She lives with her life partner, 38 year old Walter, and their two beautiful children.  This family lives together in their own house.  Her two children are the motivation for her to do her best at work everyday.  \r\n\r\nShe has been growing coffee and bananas for five years.  Also, she is a businesswoman selling fruit from the Peruvian jungle.  She gets them from her neighbors who produce these fruits.  She buys them, boxes them, and takes them to the Huancayo and Lima markets to sell.\r\n\r\nHer life partner offers public transportation services.  On his days off he helps Herlinda with the farming and in the business.  She enjoys the tranquility of the fields.  Nevertheless, it is difficult for her to take her products to the markets.  That is why she stocks her store with the harvest.\r\n\r\nEven though this job does not discourage her, it is seemingly self-sacrificing.  At the same time it is profitable.  Thanks to the profits she is able to give an adequate quality of life to her family.  That is why she plans to continue planting coffee, and most of all, she will increase her products and stock her establishment with them.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She pledges to continue working in an active manner in her communal bank.  She will use the requested loan to buy more fruit in order to continue selling it wholesale.  She will also buy tires for her husband\u2019s car.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives in Prk. Yanog, Brgy. Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP10,000. \r\n\r\nRaquel is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Raquel aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 60 years old, married and has 3 adult-aged children. Claverina owns and operates a business raising livestock, primarily pigs, for fattening and sale. Claverina has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Claverina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Claverina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase breeding livestock. Claverina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Claverina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":710062,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase breeding livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

She lives in the village of Velikaya Znamenka and sells men's and women's clothes at the local market. Viktoriya has two large, wide stalls, which allow her to expand her collection. The stalls are located in a very convenient spot in the market. As Znamenka is a small town, the market there is small as well and the biggest market is for inexpensive, practical clothing- just the type Viktoria offers.\r\n\r\nViktoriya has been trading in the market for 8 years. At this time, the income from her business is around 30,000 hryvnia. Her net income does not exceed 6,000 hryvnia per month. Viktoria would like to receive a Kiva loan of 15,000 to purchase a winter shipment of goods. Before the cold weather begins, this type of product is always in high demand. Viktoria has been in business for a long time and knows there is constant development, looking for new types of goods which bring in even higher profits. She works in a wide circle of people, ordering her goods individually. Her customers are always satisfied with her service, assortment of goods, and prices. In the future, Viktoriya plans to expand the stall and her sphere of influence."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":918946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a shipment of winter clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Velikaya Znamenka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.441667 34.345556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viktoriya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250811128},{"amount":1004.47,"local_amount":7930,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:46:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8029.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219852},{"amount":103.87,"local_amount":820,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":830.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594534},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301428068},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308188376},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315419491}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T23:11:03Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:01:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amanda Ross","image":240668}},{"id":362381,"name":"Jesus Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Jesus Margarita es soltera, tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, curs\u00f3 el primer a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n media, se dedica a la tejedur\u00eda de cortes t\u00edpicos, inici\u00f3 este negocio como operaria y hasta el momento lleva 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nSolicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de hilos de diferentes colores y clases, y crear mas productos, espera ver en el futuro su negocio grande y con amplio capital","en":"Jesus Margarita is 41 years old, single and completed one year of middle school.

Lucy is a friendly member of the community with 3 children. Lucy lives with her family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor, and iron roof.\n\nAndingo village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Rotary borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Lucy\u2019s family, and the 13 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nLucy has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Lucy volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to help the community by encouraging them to treat water, thus allowing the community to be healthy and prosperous. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Veronica, Jane, Caroline and Julius.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Lucy\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caroline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":944,"name":"Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juan is married with one child who is eight years old.

This is 39-year-old Tina C. from Tukuyu. She is married with two children, 14 and 17.  Tina has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmama lishe\u201d since 2007. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<P>\r\n\r\nTina works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Tina currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more rice, beans, salt, sugar and maize flour in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Tina thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.<P>\r\n\r\n Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice, beans, salt, sugar and maize flour in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tina G.

Elsa would like to request for a loan amounting to PHP6, 000 to have additional capital for her business. She is hoping that her business will grow by the help of the loan she is requesting to avail.\n\nElsa is already 48 years old. With her husband Elito, they are blessed with five children. Most of them ended graduating in high school and unfortunately they weren\u2019t able to pursue their studies in college due to difficulties of life.

He is married, and he lives with his wife and their two daughters in the \u201cPueblo Joven\u201d (nickname for a shanty town) Atusparias in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district.  It is located five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has been working close to 15 years in a small shoe repair stand.  It is near the Moshoqueque market (main wholesale market in the city).  He gets up very early every day to take care of his customers\u2019 orders.  Due to the constant demand for his services, he stays there very late.\r\n\r\nHis business is the only source of income for his family.  Therefore, every day he puts forth maximum effort to get ahead in his business.  He is asking our institution for a loan for 600 PEN, which he plans to use to buy the necessary materials like thread, dyes, insoles, and soles, etc.\r\n\r\nHis biggest desire is to buy a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (a motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers), which would give him an extra daily income.  This way he could give his family a greater economic stability like giving his daughters the opportunity to have some type of post high school education.\r\n\r\nTito has previously worked with us, and he has demonstrated responsibility and punctuality in his payments.  Therefore, he is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She and her husband started their business together with a good-sized investment.  However, destiny intervened and her husband was killed in an accident.  His family took all the sales from her.  She had to return to her mother's house where she received all the love and support to continue.  With a little money she bought a few films and is now investing a bit more in the business.  With the Afodenic loan she is buying a variety of films for adults and children, music, and video games.  She hopes to make good profits to recover her sales and establish a client base.  She has two children, a 2-year-old and an 11-year-old, who is in elementary school.  Her greatest wish is to have her own home so as not to depend on her family and have a home to leave to her children.  She is very happy for the opportunity the institution has given her thanks to which she will reach her new goals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":426321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of DVDs and CDs to attract customers and improve sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T20:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glennys Yamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.68,"local_amount":973.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601879},{"amount":44.66,"local_amount":893.14,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":922.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003216},{"amount":89.4,"local_amount":1788.06,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1847.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874286},{"amount":44.45,"local_amount":889,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":918.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604184},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":895.3,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":925.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821422},{"amount":44.76,"local_amount":895.29,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":925.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561436},{"amount":44.62,"local_amount":892.41,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:31Z","rounded_local_amount":922.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770395},{"amount":38.67,"local_amount":773.29,"processed_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":799.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204295}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T17:47:17Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}}]}
