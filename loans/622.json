To that end, NWTF offers green energy products designed to save money for its clients.  In a partnership with SunTransfer and Arc Finance, NWTF distributes solar-powered lanterns that also functions as a charging station for mobile phones.

Humanity is always anxious for success. Even in developing countries where in order to achieve, one should make every effort, people hope for the best. \n\nBurul A. is 55, a widow and is leader of the group. Now her children are most important in supporting her. Her daughter is a saleswoman in a sausage shop, while her daughter-in-law helps her to run a business. Seventeen years ago Burul began to earn money by sewing small orders for fellow villagers. She has finally seen some personal results from her efforts: she managed to buy a new electric sewing machine with the help of which she will sew national cloth and dressmaking supplies. With a loan Burul wants to buy a multi-logic sewing machine. Burul\u2019s aim is to open sewing workshop.\n\nGulmira A. is the group treasurer. She is 41, married and has three children. Her husband is a guest worker in Russia. Besides selling towels in the market, she gets some material support from her older children. With a loan she would like to increase her commodity\u2019s circulation and to buy more towels to sell. In the future Gulmira is planning to open her own private shop. \n\nDaniyar M., 27, is married and has two infants. Six years ago he decided to start a private enterprise in Taras, Kazakhstan, breeding cattle. Now he is working in the wholesale and retail towel trade. His loan purpose is to increase his working capital.\n\nAiymkan A., 36, is marriedand runs her business by herself because her husband is working in Russia. She makes a profit from sewing items by request. In the past she was a saleswoman of children\u2019s clothes in Bishkek. She has managed to buy an auto and some cattle. The purpose of her loan is to buy more material for sewing.

He lives in his own home in the Olmos district, a very busy commercial and agricultural area; Olmos is located in the Lambayeque province about an hour and a half from Chiclayo.  Currently, Santiago does not have water and electricity in his home.\r\n\r\nHe works raising and selling small animals like sheep, pigs, and chickens.  He keeps the animals in pens and coops on some land close to his home.  He buys the animals on the outskirts of the city and then takes the time to fatten them up and sell them in Olmos or send them to Chiclayo for sale.  He has worked in this business for 5 years.

She earns a minimum of PHP 215 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns.

is married with one son. After school he worked as an engineer. This experience helped him start his own business. Vladimir runs a small workshop manufacturing iron railings, grates, fences, etc. He has been in this business since 1996. Vladimir was one of the first entrepreneurs working in this sphere of business in the region. His turnover capital currently amounts to $4,000. \r\n\r\nVladimir is very orderly, punctual and determined. He has a team of three employees working for him. Top rate manufactured products and flexibility in working with clients have ensured the success of Vladimir\u2019s enterprise. Eight loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have also contributed to expansion of his business.   \r\n\r\nVladimir would like to get a loan of $1,000 to purchase metal roll used in manufacturing ornamental ironwork. The loan will help him increase his sales and gain additional profit. Vladimir is planning to invest generated funds in a second workshop manufacturing iron gates, railings, frames, fire grates and pokers. Age-old craft coupled with contemporary design will make this ironwork very unique and suitable to any customer\u2019s taste, environment and budget requirements. It should also be mentioned that Vladimir has been a loyal donor to the Ukrainian Association for the Visually Handicapped for several years. Funds generated by the business will allow him to provide more financial assistance to partially sighted and blind people ensuring that impaired vision does not result in an impaired life.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

A few years ago, he became a day laborer - working for others in their fields and being paid by the day. Unfortunately, this was not enough to support his family, so he turned to the Banco de Confianza for a loan. He invested that loan into raising chickens and did well for himself, using his profits to plant potatoes and strawberries in an unused portion of his property. With God's grace, he was able to harvest a healthy amount of both potatoes and strawberries. With this next loan, he will plant tomatoes, for which he will need to purchase seeds, fertilizer and pesticides.  Mauro's 4 little children help him in their spare time, and he hopes to be able to give them an education with the earnings from his garden.

The partner is grateful and expresses her satisfaction to be able to keep her own business growing and is committed to fulfill the payment of the debt in the established time frame.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":470524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase vegetables for her produce stand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T20:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haydde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":141.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":146.95},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":152.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.04,"local_amount":141.44,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:04:46Z","rounded_local_amount":151.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872600},{"amount":55.16,"local_amount":147.1,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":157.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905860},{"amount":57.37,"local_amount":152.98,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":163.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633333},{"amount":59.43,"local_amount":158.48,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":169.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667754}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T21:26:39Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esteban Riojas","image":812572}},{"id":172967,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma A. is a 42-year-old married mother of three. Her youngest is a 5-year-old and her oldest is a high school student. She and her husband work together buying and selling cell phones in their village and at the market. This couple has been in this business for more than three years now. Her husband also works as a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) driver for extra income to support and sustain the family. Emma also runs a variety store for supplementary profits, and she is a housing loan agent from time to time, because her husband's income is not enough to provide for all the needs of her three children. \r\n\r\nEmma joined ASHI in 2006, aiming to get out of the spiral of poverty and consistently acquire working capital for her business. She will use this loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos to buy a supply of cell phones for resale. She says ASHI-Kiva partners have good hearts for the poor, like her family, and really help them reach their dreams. That is why this couple has grown to love this institution very much.\r\n\r\nEmma hopes that one day she will be able to have her own produce stall at the marketplace, instead of selling cell phone products from her house. She wants to be able to make enough money to pay for her children's education. She dreams of the best life for her family, who live together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":480538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile

She has invested her loans very well, and her businesses have been growing successfully.\r\n\r\nOur member is married, has two children and, at 29 years of age, is a crafts teacher in a small village within the city of Portoviejo.  She does her work at night, traveling each day to undertake her labor, which she has been carrying for several years.  She has time to study, and is completing a degree in business management while still tending to her home and small children.\r\n\r\nSheryl very much likes commerce and, since getting married 6 years ago, runs a business with her husband selling prawns.  They started in the business because he worked at a prawn enterprise at a fishing port in the Manabi province.  They started to save money when he decided to leave this job to start their own business.  He now travels to purchase prawns by the case, which they sell by the pound to family and friends who are loyal buyers.  Separate from this business, Sheryl also sells clothing, an enterprise she started approximately 2 years ago.  This work is easy, because she already has a steady customer base.  With this business, she also helps to support the family financially.  Despite the fact that she is a mother, wife and teacher, she somehow manages to find time to handle everything.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Sheryl would be able to invest in buying herself a freezer to store her prawns.  Her dream is to extend the business into other towns, but this requires a greater investment.  They are thinking about paying for the freezer in cash.  Another project planned is to have a sewing workshop alongside her mother, who has always motivated her.  Sheryl is very sure that she will be able to make her dream a reality.    \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":551272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a freezer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T11:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sheryl Denys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":253.13,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":253.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892565},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632911},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846945},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113406}],"funded_date":"2010-06-11T18:32:10Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":210366,"name":"Virlie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virlie B. is from the village of Lugait, Misamis Oriental.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is his first loan through MFP, and he is happy to belong to his communal bank, which is one of the most well-known in his area.

For four years she has provided a laundry service. Her mother taught her this work and they used to wash a lot of laundry, but with the passing of time her health deteriorated. So, Raquel decided to buy herself a washing machine. It has allowed her business to keep afloat, and thanks to this piece of equipment she can offer a laundry service and save time and energy, and be better equipped in order to continue offering a quality service.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Nkwaateng is in the Eastern Region of Ghana. A sizeable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite an appreciable number are also involved in trading and other business activities. Theresa is in the business of palm oil production. She has been in business for eleven good years and is full of rich experiences. \r\n<p>\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community; processes them in her house to produce the oil and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from the food of the palm fruits which has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (thus the oil) is skimmed off and reboiled to expel water content.\r\n<p>\r\nTheresa desires to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruits in bulk to be able to supply to more customers. She believes the loan assistance would enable her to scale up production to serve a larger market and eventually, help improve her family finances.

He is 39 years old, married, and has two children who are 1 and 5 years old. Neither is currently in school. He studied through the 10th grade but didn't continue because of his parents' lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and is not helping to support anyone else. \r\n\r\nBernardo left Inhambane for Maputo with his parents when he was 7 years old. Later he moved to the Massaca neighborhood in the district of Boane with his family. He has his own business, raising and selling broiler chickens. He has owned two chicken coops for the past 2 years and does not employ any outside help. He buys the baby chicks for 18.00mt and sells the grown chickens for 90.00mt. This business gives him a monthly income of almost 5.000.00mt, which he uses to pay household expenses. He is also able to save some money in his bank account each month. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans with other banks. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva field partner] through friends of his who are also customers of the institution. This is his 2nd loan, in the amount of 18.000.00mt. He plans to use this money to buy products (baby chicks, feed, vaccines and other items) to continue with his business venture. His previous loan was for 15.000.00mt and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nBernardo promises to repay the loan as stated, so that he can get other loans in the future. He would like to borrow more money to build more chicken coops and continue developing his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

They have children and, for the sake of them and their future, these people are making great sacrifices every day. \r\n\r\nKulshara is the leader of this group. She is forty three years old. Her husband is a member of a farm association. When he has free time he works as a taxi driver. Together they have raised five children. Two of her daughters are married while the other three children are school students. \r\n\r\nKulshara is a housewife. Besides running a household, she has about five sheep. Whenever they need money they sell sheep to meet their needs. Sometimes they butcher the sheep and sell the meat. This activity brings them around 45 dollars a month. They started keeping sheep ten years ago. Originally they bought three sheep, fed them and sold them. This made them a pretty decent profit and became their usual way of earning money. As a result, they have been able to raise their children without obstacles. Kulshara is applying for a loan to buy one cow to produce milk for sale. \r\n\r\nKulshara has four partners:\r\n\r\nTurganbubu, 56, raises cattle. Currently she has a horse. Her children have grown up and Turganbubu is already raising her grandchildren. Her husband is a retired man and he actively helps her look after the cattle. Turganbubu hopes to obtain this loan to buy a cow. \r\n\r\nSalkynbubu, 58, is the wife of a school teacher. She stays at home and looks after cattle. Salkynbubu is the mother of eight children. All her children have grown up and now make their own living. Salkynbubu has applied for this loan to buy some sheep.\r\n\r\nSharapat, 58, is the mother of eight children. All her children are grown\u2013up and live separately. Sharapat and her husband are retired. They keep some cattle and need a loan to purchase cattle. \r\n\r\nAinura, 47, has two children. Her husband works in the local municipality. Ainura has a small shop and sells foodstuffs. She needs a loan to purchase some sheep. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of both its customers and the society), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

He lives with his wife and children in the Dougounina quarter in the town of Bougouni (third administrative region of Mali). Never having attended school for social reasons, he began working very early, notably training in mechanics, sheet-metal working, automobile electricity, and welding at a local and respected garage. Eventually, Bakary chose to work with sheet metal over the other options. With ten years of experience, he is often solicited for his business.\r\nWhen researching supplementary financial options, Bakary decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microcredit program. He is on his first loan and counts on using it to buy a large quantity of various materials used in sheet metal work (gum, glue, gas for torching, rods, etc.). Bakary gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and always works in the garage where he learned the business. His clients are diverse and varied. Bakary hopes to make a monthly profit of 35,000 FCFA which will allow him to grow his business and contribute to his family's needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":516388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of various materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961345},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180552},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751833},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":64114.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360682}],"funded_date":"2010-04-04T18:31:43Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":193995,"name":"Wella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wella R. is from the village of Initao, Iligan City.

They live together in the community of Manitea Alta, located in the beautiful jungle of  Cusco, where they have their own house maD. of adobe.  When she had her first son, she was still young and was living in with her parents, but that living situation was uncomfortable so she started her own business.  With the support of her partner, they decided to start cultivating cocoa.  Over time, they have both come to sell to wholesalers at a reasonable price.  Now she produces and sells cocoa and coffee, and knowing that these are exportable products, they have in mind that they would like to continue to expand their production in the near future.  When they do, it will take a lot of effort and dedication.\r\n\r\nIn general, they sell their products in their community's gathering center, where sales have been growing steadily.  Normally Luz works with her partner from 6:00 in the morning to 6:00 at night, but they rest on Sundays in order to spend time with their children.\r\n\r\nTheir future plan is to open a grocery store because they need extra income.  This is Luz's sixth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma.  She promises to make repayments in a punctual manner and furthermore, she is supported by her well-organized community group.  With the loan she's requesting, she will buy fertilizer and in this way will ensure better production of cocoa and coffee.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie Kavanagh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":551309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer in order to improve cocoa and coffee production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1567.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326784}],"funded_date":"2010-06-12T01:48:09Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":210382,"name":"Tojiddin","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0423\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0422\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043d\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 31 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b. \u0422\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b.","en":"Tojiddin U. lives in the town of Tursun-zoda.

The members decided on this name because they are all Catholics and followers of the Virgin of Guadalupe.\r\n\r\nSince Se\u00f1ora Luciana C. P. is president of the group, the following information is about her. She is 44 years old, married to Sr. Antonio, and has three children: Marisol aged 24, Eduardo 19, and Esteban 16. The eldest is already married, and the other two are in high school. \r\n\r\nLuciana has run a grocery store for nine years. She decided to open the store when a relative told her that is was a good source of income. Also it would help her husband pay for household expenses, the education of their children, as well as improve the standard of living of the family. With her loan she has bought more merchandise: rice, beans, milk, sugar, cookies, toilet paper, soap, detergent, and other items so that the store is a little better stocked.\r\n\r\nLuciana says she is very happy because the store is doing well. Sales have gone up a lot and she has more customers. As a result her income has increased satisfactorily, so much so that she has bought a blender.\r\n\r\nThe store has also brought benefits to the community as there are hardly any stores nearby so now people do not have to walk as far. Also they get friendly attentive service and affordable prices.\r\n\r\nLuciana\u2019s goal is to continue supporting her children with their education so that they can get good jobs and have a better future. She also wants to expand her small business by making the store a little bigger so she can carry more stock and earn more money.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that the group members work hard. They have known each other for a quite a long time and are very responsible about making repayments on their loans. They do not want to betray the trust and help that have been given to them. Luciana is very grateful to the Realidad Foundation and Kiva for their support which has enabled her to improve her own and her family\u2019s standard of living, and to continue running the store.\r\n\r\nThe names of the group members and their activities are as follows:\r\nSugey Campuzano Hern\u00e1ndez-baker\r\n\u2028Guadalupe P.

Only one of them, Jos\u00e9, lives with her in her own house located in the city of San Ram\u00f3n (Peruvian Central Jungle).  \r\n\r\nShe feels happy.  For the last 18 years she\u2019s loved her citrus fruit plants, bananas and papayas that she\u2019s dedicated all this time to providing the necessary care.  She confesses that she loves walking along her entire field because all agricultural activity makes her feel alive.  Segundina affirms:  \u201cWithout my crops I wouldn\u2019t have been able to have anything, nothing to eat nor been able to educate my children.  Saving money I was able to build my little house where I raise guinea pigs to sell and for my own consumption.  This is why I say that with God\u2019s blessings and because I\u2019ve known how to work I\u2019ve lacked nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe also affirms that her income is secure because she harvests bananas every two weeks and that covers her basic needs while profits from oranges, mandarins and papaya are for savings and to cover any unexpected expense that might crop up later.\r\n\r\nHer dream is eventually to have her own money (capital) to plant new crops in the fields she owns.  She belongs to the \u201cGotitas D. Roc\u00edo\u201d (Little Dewdrops) and this is her sixth MFP loan where she\u2019s convinced that she\u2019ll make her installment payments since she is well aware of her communal bank\u2019s method of operation.  In addition, she gives thanks for the support provided.  If Segundina were to receive your support, she will use the requested money to buy natural fertilizers to spread among her plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":853669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy natural fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":217.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":229.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":242.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":255.81},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":269.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":284.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.27},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":367.54,"local_amount":1002.39,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851227},{"amount":99.6,"local_amount":271.64,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":272.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666406},{"amount":82.86,"local_amount":225.97,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":226.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385490}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T22:36:55Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":333326,"name":"Altansukh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Altansukh is 41 years old, and lives with his wife and two children in UIaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

She also keeps a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nAvailability of labor is a major challenge for Rose. Before joining Juhudi, Rose could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high-risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the group Kerbut farmers. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learned about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about Kiva. Rose is seeking a loan build a fence around her homestead. Through the loan, her cows will not go to her neighbor\u2019s farm destroying crops, hence saving money that she used to pay for damages. She will also benefit from controlled grazing of her animal and keeping away thieves. Rose waits for your kindness.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1829031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for a fence.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.87},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":993857,"name":"Damaris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damaris is 31 years old, married and blessed with 4 children.

This is 29-year-old Tumaini K., who is married and has one child, aged 7. She also has two other dependents who live with her because they are orphans.  In 2002, Tumaini established her pharmacy business.

She is 46 years old. Leticia is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI\/Kiva. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Leticia S. Group.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and has 3 adult-aged children. She owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Leticia has been involved in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leticia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Leticia is requesting a new loan, her fifth, of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Ram\u00edrez.  This is her story: she is a single mother who struggles daily to support her 4 children who are between the ages of 13 and 23, since they are all in school.  She is a dressmaker, and with the loan she received she is going to buy zippers, thread, fabric, needles, and other materials that she needs to continue with her work.\r\n\r\nClaudia Francisca decided to go into this line of work because she learned to sew a number of years ago since her mother taught her these skills. Also, she needed to find a way to support her children so that they would have a better future, since she did not have anyone to support her economically.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that the sales in her business are going well.  Now that the children have returned to school she has had a lot of work because she had a large number of orders for uniforms for the elementary, secondary and pre-schools.  Thanks to this work her income increased substantially.\r\n\r\nShe wants to give thanks to FRAC and to the Kiva lenders, since thanks to them she has been able to continue with her business and continue supporting her children in their studies.  She has also substantially increased the quality of life for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nClaudia Francisca dreams of being able to buy 4 sewing machines to put in her sewing workshop.  In this way she could employ women like her who are single mothers and need work to support their children.  In addition, she wants to continue to pay for her children's education so that they can finish their professional degrees and have better opportunities in life.\r\n\r\nThe members of the communal bank \"Las Guerreras\" and the activities they carry out are the following:\r\nMar\u00eda Teresa M.

The members decided to give their group this name in honor of the name of their community, because they are very proud to be from this place. The history is near and dear to Armida I. B., who is part of this group. She is 47 years old, married to Juli\u00e1n Gazga. They have three sons: Ezequiel, 19, Antonio, 17, and Jos\u00e9 Luis, 15. All three are studying, two at prep school, and the youngest is in the third year of high school. Armida sells shoes by catalog, which she has been doing for more than 8 years.\r\n\r\nShe says that she decided to start this business because she wanted to find a way to help her husband with household expenses and her children's education costs. Also she says in her town there isn't anybody who sells this sort of product. Besides, as she was preparing to start this business, she found that in addition to the (economic) benefit, she enjoyed it. The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase more catalogs and merchandise, such as tennis shoes, sandals, women's shoes, men's shoes, and boots, so that she will have more product variety.\r\n\r\nWith the revenue from her business, she is benefiting pretty well because she is able to help her children succeed, and she is greatly improving her quality of life. Also, she is able to support her husband 100% in paying the household bills, and support her children in their studies so they can have a better future.\r\n\r\nShe commented that with her business, she is also helping many people in her community, since her business is the only one that sells that product there, and she sells her product to people through a payment system, since they are not able to buy outright with cash. Plus, they don't have to go all the way to the city, which would mean traveling and spending time.\r\n\r\nArminda's goal is to give a quality education to her children so they can study for a career and have a great job, so that they will have a better future. Also, she wants to make her business grow much more, and she is thinking of building a shoe store so she will have better revenue.\r\n\r\nShe says that all her fellow group members are responsible people who make their payments and like to work so that they will advance and succeed over any difficulty. Up until now, nobody has failed to make his payment because everybody has known each other for some time and they pay up because they don't want to defraud anybody who has put trust in them.\r\n\r\nArmida gives thanks on behalf of herself and her family to FRAC and Kiva because thanks to them she was able to change her life and her children's lives, so no they can have a better education and quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of Las Vigue\u00f1as and the businesses that they have are as follows:\r\nOlga G. Z. - Cosmetics sales\r\nArmida I. B. - Sale of shoes by catalog\r\nMaria Blanca G. L.- Perfume sales\r\nCristina S. L. - Beverage sales\r\nAm\u00e9rica C.

She earns her living by operating a general store and a food vending business.  Her husband Gaspar, who is 50 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are between 9 and 22 years old. Rosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,400 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase more goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and to have a tricycle for transportation. Rosita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

That is why she is asking for a loan from INTEGRAL to buy ingredients to prepare the pupusas such as pork cracklings, cheese, beans, corn and beverages. In this way, she will have what her customers need, and reach her goal. Rosa is confident that her work and dedication will allow her to give her family a better quality of life.

This is Ronald. He is the Head Teacher of Nganwa Junior School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Kabwohe in Sheema with 1200 students. Nganwa Junior School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nNganwa Junior School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

The humble life has made her more driven to make a better living by breeding goats. She started this business as her neighbourhood has abundant food supply for breeding goats. Due to the limited capital, Ni Komang Notri only raises 4 goats. The goat cost Rp. 300,000 each and it can be sold 5 months later with price of Rp. 600,000 - Rp. 700,000 each so she can get profit of Rp. 800,000 after deducting the maintenance cost. Although the profit is not much, Ni Koming Notri is still grateful that she can support the family's economy thanks to this business. Furthermore, her wish to renovate her house has encouraged her even more to save some of the profit. After getting the loan from DINARI, Ni Komang Notri becomes more enthusiastic in the business and she wants to buy 3 more female goats so that she can breed more goat offsprings and she doesn't need to buy more goat offsprings. She hopes with this she can gain more profit so that she can make a better living for the family.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTinggal di rumah yang sangat sederhana yang hanya berdinding bata  tidak membuat Ni Komang Notri dan keluarganya patah semangat dalam menjalani kehidupan. Segala kesederhanaan itu justru membuatnya bersemangat dalam bekerja untuk bisa hidup lebih baik lagi yaitu dengan  memelihara kambing. Hal ini dilakukannya mengingat situasi lingkungan yang mendukung yaitu dengan tersedianya pakan yang cukup bagi keperluan ternaknya ini.  Terbatasnya modal yang dimiliki mengharuskan Ni Komang Notri hanya memelihara 4 ekor Kambing . Kambing itu dibeli dengan harga Rp. 300.000 per ekor,- dan  dalam waktu 5 bulan berhasil dijualnya dengan harga Rp. 600.000,- Rp.700.000 per ekor sehingga keuntungan bersih yang diperolehnya Rp. 800.000,- setelah dikurangi biaya pemeliharaan. Walaupun keuntungan yang diperolehnya tidak banyak tapi Ni Komang Notri tetap bersyukur karena keluarganya bisa hidup dari hasil usahanya tersebut. Keinginan untuk merenovasi rumahnya membuat Ni Komang Notri terpacu untuk mulai menyisihkan sedikit hasil usahanya ini.. Setelah menerima pinjaman modal usaha dari DINARI Ni Komang Notri menjadi lebih bersemangat lagi dalam usahanya  dan ingin membeli 3 ekor induk kambing agar nantinya induk kambing ini mempunyai anak dan Ni Komang Notri tidak perlu membeli bibit untuk kambing penggemukan lagi ia hanya memelihara anak tersebut,dengan harapan keuntungan yang diperoleh akan lebih meningkat dan keluarganya bisa sejahtera."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":131581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

A. is 34 years old. She lives in Pucallpa, Peru \u2013 a major city in the eastern jungle region of the country. This steaming, humid city is situated on the banks of the Ucayali River, a tributary of the Amazon River. Nilsa is a member of the Las Dalilas communal bank and has been taking out small business loans for 2 years to support her bodega, or corner store. These small businesses are very common throughout Peru and provide a convenient way for people to earn livings working from their own homes. Bodegas are located in the converted front room of the home and sales are made through grated windows or doors.

C. is 29 years old and married. Kenneth has three children. His son is 10 years old and in the fourth grade. His daughter is three years old and not yet in school, and his second son is 1 year old and not yet in school. Kenneth's wife works as a nurse. Kenneth would like to maintain his business, as it is the only means he has of supporting his family, and not all young people work in this type of business. He dreams of increasing production of suit designs to expand his client base. That way he would be able to achieve innovation in the market and his products would not only be recommended by people in this country but also be envied by foreigners. This would provide Kenneth with more earnings. He would like to buy more machines in order to give jobs to people who would truly like to get ahead and provide a measure of stability for their families, as the majority of families today are supported by women.\r\n\r\nKenneth is a tailor, working from his home and also traveling through town. He has been in this business for 10 years, having started when he was 19 years old. At the time he didn't have a job and needed income urgently in order to support his family. He therefore offered his services as a tailor, initially making suits for children, women, and men. He was able to support himself because his neighbors kept returning to his store.Kenneth gained fame because he as able to show off the affluence of his clients. Kenneth decided to invest his earnings as working capital and he had experiences that changed his perspective on life.\r\n\r\nHis loan will be used as working capital to buy materials such as: clothing, needles, thread, and scissors. Above all, Kenneth would like to buy cloth for uniforms, as the school year is approaching. He appreciates the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and its partner organizations, which want to see their clients progress. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":263741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenneth Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":611.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":611.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":611.11,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":614.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400033},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":611.11,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":614.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092031},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":611.11,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":614.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985414},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":611.11,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":614.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446029},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":611.11,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":614.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956668},{"amount":122.21,"local_amount":2444.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2457.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174090}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T13:33:09Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":90752,"name":"Marlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"At the age of 48, Marlyn L., married with 3 children, continues to struggle to earn money for her family.

Nora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nora joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Nora is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Nora from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She has lived in Cadj\u00e8houn in Cotonou for nearly 20 years. She is married to Alexis Akakossi who is a tailor.  Madame H. has three children in her care, two of whom are her own, and all of them attend school. She lives with her children and her spouse, and together, she and her husband manage the family expenses. Madame H. herself did not go to school. In order to support her and her family's needs, she sells second-hand clothing door-to-door. She stocks up at Dantokpa, Benin's international market. Madame H. has already had two loans from Kiva Field Partner, ALID\u00e9, and both loans have been paid back. She is now requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9, so that she can grow her business to sell more clothes and thus see greater savings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":434313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy second-hand clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-11-26T10:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.66,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623679},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020384},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858877},{"amount":34.56,"local_amount":15200,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":15288.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.27,"payment_id":136619023},{"amount":19.78,"local_amount":8800,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8851.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.39,"payment_id":144652985},{"amount":55,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":24139.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835065},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953941},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-27T07:55:41Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055621},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12069.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347198}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T03:19:09Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:29:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":160626,"name":"Ameru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ameru D. is currently in the business of selling tea and bread.

They live together in their own home, in the village of Canayre, in Llochegua district.\r\n\r\nAndrea is a very hard-working woman.  She recalls that, before she owned her pharmacy, she used to sell her medicines by knocking on doors, moving from one village to the next.  She served a lot of patients as the doctors didn't get out as far as these places.  The nearest health center was more than four hours away.  Andrea took advantage of this fact.  She saw that her sales were increasing gradually and sustainably, and she already had an established customer base.  Andrea therefore decided to make inroads into the medicine sales business.  She mostly works with her partner but she also sometimes receives help from her parents.  She works from 5.00am to 9.00pm.  In the future, she plans to expand her pharmacy with the goal of continuing to prevent many illnesses and relieving the pain of many patients.\r\n\r\nThis will be Andrea's second loan from MFP.

This will allow her to buy more merchandise such as basic grains, sugar, candy, bread, instant products, beverages, and other things.  This way, little by little, she will be able to grow her business and achieve one of her greatest goals in life.  Dina has confidence that if her work is viable she will be able to give her family financial security as well as a full life.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He brings the vegetables from Istaravshan. His brother and wife help him with the business. Hamrokul submitted an application for an eight-month loan of 1500 somoni.
