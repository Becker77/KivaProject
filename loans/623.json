She is a very loving and hard-working mother. She lives in her own home with her husband Nestor, age 38, and their 3 beloved daughters for whom they care with great love and tenderness in the hamlet of Cumutay. The family works in agriculture. From the beginning of their family life, she started putting all that her parents had taught her into practice. Her husband has always supported her in caring for their crops and making decisions. She says that they bought some land 20 years ago where they can sow potatoes, peas and corn. They are still working these lands, but they are now far more productive, and their crops are high quality. What Balvina most enjoys about her work is the close relationship that she has with the land. She greatly enjoys watching her crops grow. She now has to work the land full-time because, thanks to the geography of the area, the state is building a hydroelectric power station where her husband is working in order to obtain extra money. She finds her greatest challenge to be caring for her land in difficult weather, since everything can affect the harvest. In the future, she hopes to have the necessary funds to purchase a vehicle. She belongs to the \"Pioneros de Cumutay\" communal bank and this is her first loan with MFP. She hopes for the support of each one of you in order to continue with her plans. Balvina, with your support, will invest the requested loan in the purchase of a bag of pea seeds for her next crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":813133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a bag of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":548.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835509}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T00:37:34Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":320685,"name":"Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alberto es un joven muy creativo dese hace 5 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 su propio negocio para la elaboraci\u00f3n de cintos, carteras, porta celulares y mas.

With the great effort and energy that each one has put in to working as a team, her great art-making talent in her beautiful works have been recognised in competitions at interprovincial: the family representative was her oldest son and now everyone is in search of new innovative designs for their engraved mates.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is Fatuma A..  She is 38 years old, married, and has five children between the ages of 10 and 20 years old. In 2005, Fatuma established her general store business. Working seven days a week, and 9 to12 hours a day, she earns about $430 each month from this business. She is assisted by her hursband, children, and one employee. Fatuma has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of soap, rice, sugar, biscuits, and cloth. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $175. In the future, Fatuma plans to open a new business. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":140690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks (e.g., soap, rice, sugar, biscuits, and cloth) in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T09:47:22Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200093},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227087},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256327},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285068},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315261},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346834},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347574},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970194},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886444},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435730}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T09:47:22Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45320,"name":"Laura","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Laura belongs to the Las Shipibas Community Bank in Jr. Martir Olaya, in the Calleria District in Ucayali.

He has approximately 15 years of experience in this business, which currently is the primary means of income for him and his family.  He has a clothing stand in a well-known market in Guatemala, the Roosevelt Market, where women come to purchase his items as well as mothers for their children.\r\n\r\nRufino P\u00e9rez states that he has undertaken to provide excellent service to his customers to ensure repeat business, and also indicates that he sells his products at good prices so that they will return to see him.\r\nRufino buys items to sell such as sweaters, blouses, women and children\u2019s suits, as well as onesies, pants and tops for children.\r\n\r\nRufino comments that during this season he has the opportunity to add another business, given the nearness of the Christmas holidays.  The Guatemala municipality, in the month of December, rents two square meters of space to sell holiday-related items.  This occurs in the famous 6th Avenue of Guatemala Street, a location with a great deal of commerce.\r\n\r\nRufino needs funding to purchase supplies, so he will have the necessary items to sell.  During this season, he has one person to help him at his other stand so that he can make sure both locations are well tended to.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Rufino indicates that he is well-known at the Roosevelt Market where students from San Carlos University seek him out.  He mentions that even professional women visit him to buy his goods, which motivates him further to continue forging ahead along with his family.\r\n\r\nRufino\u2019s dream is to see his family prosper, providing education, good health, a home and, most of all, a loving family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

Jacquelyn earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nJacquelyn joined Kiva partner, PMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jacquelyn is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first she has taken from PMPC.

She lives by herself in a house that her parents gave her, since she never married.  What she wants most is to live a quiet life.  The tailoring business runs in her family, as she learned this art from her father when she was still very young.  Her shop is very busy, and her customers line up for her to make them a garment.  Although she has many customers, she works alone because her income still does not allow her to hire an assistant, who would help her make the orders faster.  What Julia likes most about her job is finishing a garment.  She has been doing this for 20 years, and the most difficult part is staying in the tailor shop all day.   Julia is eager for her business to grow over time and to become one of the most recognized tailor shops in the city of Juliaca.  This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she is prepared to pay it on time.  She does not want to cause problems with her partners at the communal bank, where she actively participates.  With the requested $675 (2,000 PEN), she will buy new materials to make her garments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel McRoberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":364570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641694},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081136},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997286},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842630},{"amount":225.45,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":671.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734205}],"funded_date":"2009-08-08T01:52:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel McRoberts","image":602385}},{"id":131378,"name":"Esmirna","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Esmirna tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 2 hijos que ya son independientes y trabajan, en la actualidad vive sola y en su casa propia.

This city is well known for its Inca ruins and the history that in earlier times, when there was not yet a city where there are now streets, this was the site of the house of the Inca \"Tupac Inca Yupanqui\". The town is very interesting not only for its ruins and the temple, but for the dress and customs as well as the colorful and well attended Sunday fair.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting this communal bank Mateo Pumacahua, we talked with a member, Paulina, who is 66 years old, is married, has 3 children, and lives in the city of Chinchero in the department of Cusco. Her principal work is providing food service. She set up a room in her house where she opened a store and there she is able to sell her traditional foods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother of two children who are her biggest reason to get ahead.  She lives at her mother\u2019s house and hopes to soon be able to improve the quality of life for herself and her children.  For Catherine, the food sales business helps her to be able to earn income to provide her children with a good education.  She works from her mother\u2019s house and has been in this business for over two years now.  She is comfortable working there, as she has time to do other things in addition to having time to be with her children and her mother.  What she likes most about her business is being able to have free time in the afternoons so that she can do other things, as she is a proactive woman.  What she does not like is that she sometimes has to loan money to some diners who take a long time to repay her.  However, she is always in good spirits and she receives her money in the end.  Her business is located near a large company in the city, which is why she has a large number of customers and thus, good daily earnings.  She is starting to remodel her place of business in hopes of increasing business.  This is Catherine\u2019s first loan with MFP and she hopes that it goes well, as she has high hopes of continuing to work with the same group of borrowers.  So far, everyone has treated her well and she feels comfortable.

Chalkhaajav only recently got back to his job just a few months ago. He lives with his wife and his daughter in their small house which is built in the early 1970s.   \r\n\r\nLately his house has became very old and damaged in many parts, especially the floor, walls and the roof. Therefore he decided to make renovations to his house in order to live in comfortable living conditions with his family. According to his plan, he will add insulation to the walls and windows before this winter because there is always too much heat-loss by the uninsulated walls and windows. The loan he is requesting will be dedicated to purchasing some necessary building materials to make renovations to his old house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":934244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

They all live together in a cozy house that is their own.  For some years she has been knitting and crocheting garments, an activity that makes her very happy since it is one of her favorite hobbies.  She learned to knit when she was very small watching her mother, who taught her all of the secrets of this creative craft.  Every day she must work through orders from the people who live in her area, since all of her friends and acquaintances request her fashions in the colors and designs they prefer.  Usually they request these garments for their children, since Maria's specialty is to knit small garments, but when they request something larger she is able to make it without a problem.  The orders are good, and she completes them in the time agreed upon, and for this reason she is thinking of enlarging her business in the future by starting to sell knitted garments wholesale.

However, this ideal path awaits not everybody. And whoever it would be, a person has to be ready to any turn and any situation. The strong people do not expect or dream much about less probable things and just use the best use of the opportunities that life presents for them. \r\n<p>\r\nSiyagul is the leader of this group.

He has a small store that sells drinks and milk products.\r\n\r\nRoberto began selling drinks in El Guasmo to his friends, neighbors, and those he knew. With effort, he was able to remodel a part of his house to contain his little shop. Now, he works from 9:00am until 10:00pm every day, selling drinks, milk products, and other provisions.\r\n\r\nTo restock his small store he needs a loan to buy drinks and milk products and, thus, to have the opportunity to be a micro-entrepreneur. In the future, he wishes to become a drink distributor. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Hangkayaw, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a rice mill and farming. Her husband, Alipio Loquiso, who is 47 years old, works as a rice mill operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 5 and 21 years old. \r\n\r\nHazel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hazel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers for her farm so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the improvement of her businesses. \r\n\r\nHazel L. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon .

She's a trained hairdresser, but is not practicing at this time because she lacks the financial means to open a hairdressing salon. Instead, she sells coolers, basins, bowls, plastic ware, as well as cosmetics and hair care products. Georgette gets her supplies at the Topka market, an international marketplace in B\u00e9nin. She then resells her products on credit in the surrounding neighborhoods. After a few days, she comes back to collect the money from her customers, according to the specified payment terms.

cortes, g\u00fcipiles, blusas y su\u00e9teres; ella sale a vender de manera ambulante en el municipio de San Juan Sacatepequez cerca de donde ella vive. Ella cuenta que inicio su negocio vendiendo 2 o 3 prendas, las cuales ella compraba al cr\u00e9dito y despu\u00e9s de la venta ella los pagaba, pero poco a poco las personas empezaron hacer mas pedidos, por lo que se integro a un Banco de Confianza con FAPE, este capital  le  ayudo ya que contaba capital peque\u00f1o para comprar al contado parte de la mercader\u00eda y ya no todo al cr\u00e9dito.  Sus sue\u00f1os son poder abrir un local propio para ya no vender de forma ambulante ya que tiene dos ni\u00f1as, una de 3 a\u00f1os y otra de 7 meses de edad, por lo que cuando sale a vender es un poco dif\u00edcil llevarlas a ambas,  si tuviera un local propio podr\u00eda atender mejor a sus hijas y mantener su negocio.  El capital que solicita le ayudar\u00e1 a surtir su negocio, ya que sus clientes le piden variedad de colores y estilos diferentes de blusas, fajas y delantales los cuales ella no tiene, ella quiere aprovechar estos meses que se aproximan,   ya que ser\u00e1n las fiestas locales de San Juan  y San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez.  Elsa Marina cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien es carpintero y a la vez ella ha sido un apoyo para \u00e9l, porque contribuye a la econom\u00eda de su casa,  y al incrementar sus ganancias en el negocio tambi\u00e9n mejora su condici\u00f3n de vida  ya  que quiere darles un buen futuro a sus hijas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ","en":"For the past 3 years Elsa Marina has been selling typical clothes such as lengths of material, \"g\u00fcipiles\", blouses, and sweaters. She is a street vendor in the municipality of San Juan Sacatepequez, close to where she lives. She tells that she started her business selling 2 or 3 garments, which she bought on credit, and after selling them she would pay, but little by little people started making more orders and therefore she joined a \"Banco de Confianza\" with FAPE. The capital helped her, as with a small capital she could buy some merchandise and pay cash, not all on credit. It is her dream to open a shop so that she does not have to sell on the streets as she has two daughters, 3 years and 7 months old, and it is difficult for her to take both, and if she had her own store she could look after the girls while maintaining her business. The loan requested will help supply her business as her clients ask for a variety of colors and styles, different blouses, girdles, and aprons which she does not have in stock, and she wants to take advantage of the following months as there will be local fiestas at San Juan and San Pedro Sacatepequez. Elsa Marina has the support of her husband who is a carpenter and she is also a support to him as she contributes to the home economy. Increasing her earnings, the living conditions will improve as she wants to give a better future to her daughters.\r\n\r\n

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Apoline sells drinks (Primus and Mutzig beer, Fanta sodas, etc.). She displays her products in front of friends' and acquaintances' shops (on the street, the Signers roundabout) and sells wholesale; she occasionally sells retail from her home. She began her small business with her own money, which she received from her father-in-law as a gift. Her initial capital investment was twenty dollars, which is equivalent to two cases of Primus beer. She has been in business for sixteen years. With the loan from the microfinance institution Hekima, Baseme B. Apoline would like to increase her sales by buying 36 cases of Fanta.\r\n\r\nBaseme B. Apoline's greatest challenge is that people sometimes drink on credit, with the risk of paying her back late. Others buy, but do not return the empty bottles. Despite all this, Baseme B. Apoline makes her maximum profit; she is comfortable with her business.\r\n\r\nBaseme B. Apoline thanks the microfinance institution Hekima for the permanent loans which she is receiving with no material collateral. Thanks to these loans, she is able to meet her family's needs, she says.\r\n\r\nThe Umoja Kibabi group is comprised of twenty members, the majority of which are women.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robin Clochard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":533391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"36 cases of Fanta and Primus","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She has one son but she lives alone in the community of Huaracayo.  The years of dedication and service she spent raising her son taught her that there is no better reward in life than seeing your children progress.  Ten years ago, she began to work in agriculture, raising corn and peas.  After growing them, she takes them to the central market in the capital where she sells them wholesale.  Now, she would like to open a small hardware store in the central area of her native city of Tarma, because she understands that she does not have the strength that she used to; she feels alone and wants to be close to her son who lives in the city.  This is her first loan through MFP and she is very happy to belong to a village bank that is very well-respected in her neighborhood.  She knows that with the help of the bank, she will be able to achieve her goal.

They live in their own house located in the Sivia district. Mar\u00eda is an enterprising woman. She recalls that before she had her pharmacy, she offered beauty products from door-to-door, moving from one city to another, serving any customers she was able to find. With time, her business grew slowly and she also had a considerable number of customers. Later, she met Edgar, her now-husband, who is a nurse. \r\n\r\nSince that time, they opened a pharmacy where they currently both work. Thus Mar\u00eda sells her beauty products along with her husband\u2019s medications.

Since he finished high school, he has had to work as he did not have the opportunity to study in the university.  It is because of this that, 5 years ago, with his savings, he purchased a three-wheel cart, which he has turned into his primary source of income by transporting passengers.  Usually he works from 8 in the morning until the early evening so that he can earn enough to support his little Jhony and that way cover his expenses.  He really likes his work and feels useful now that he is doing the work and can talk and share with the people that need his services.  But, sometimes, when he works late, the streets become dangerous making this the hard part of his work.  The motivation for such effort is his little one, who he wants to get ahead and make a good man.  He would like to invest the money from the loan to repair his cart which is damaged and that way improve the service he provides.  In the future, Juan wants to buy a three-wheeled motor cart to start another business on the side and that way increase his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":214619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair of his three-wheeled cart that he uses to transport passengers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T01:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T05:05:49Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957424},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227674},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422909},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116133},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011093},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594700}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T04:05:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joanna Silverman","image":null}},{"id":74060,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose A. is a 56-year-old divorced mother of two children, both of whom are currently in school. For the past twenty five years, Rose has been a trader at the local market of Tema in Ghana. More specifically, she is food vendor operator who sells porridge (koko and masa). She notes that many Ghanaians enjoy this food, especially in the morning, and that most students eat this food (which they call \"sha bra,\" meaning \"sharp brain\") because it is very affordable. <p>\r\n\r\nWith her 25 years of experience, however, she is convinced that her business can really excel with an increase in capital. As such, she is seeking a loan to increase her inventory by purchasing an additional stock of firewood and food stuffs such as sugar, beans, groundnuts, millet, and wheat.

They have 6 children who are between 17 and 33 years old.  Three of her children have their own familes. The three remaining children help their parents with the business as part of their daily chores, and one of them is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAnita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase the amount of money they bring in every month, earning an average monthly income of Php 12,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAnita is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,500 was used to fund operations of her general store.  It had a positive impact in both maintaining and growing the business, as well as improving the family\u2019s living conditions. Now Anita is borrowing for her 14th loan, the amount of Php 22000, which she intends to use to buy supplies for both her sari sari store and the pig fattening business.

Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":469533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

then dried according to the customer\u2019s requests.\r\n\r\nShe resells her peanuts from her home, throughout the village with help from her children, and on rare occasions at the weekly market fair in Segou, for cash or credit, to men, women and children customers.\r\n\r\nMariam hopes to achieve monthly earnings of 19,000 FCFA which will be used to reimburse her loan, contribute to some family expenses, participate in social festivities (weddings, baptisms, and funerals), increase her working capital, and purchase a few kitchen utensils in view of preparing the young girls\u2019 wedding

S. is a 46-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (variety) store and a charcoal business. She lives in Purok Malipayon, San Agustin, Barangay Paraiso, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nMerryssa has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and charcoal businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 6,000.\r\n\r\nMerryssa is now borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she can purchase additional stock to sell. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.\r\n\r\nMerryssa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He tries hard to give the best to his two dear children, who are the reason why he continues working. They live together in their own house.  He farms on three hectares of land, where he grows cacao, coffee, achiote (annatto seeds) and peanuts.\r\n\r\nHis parents taught him to till the soil from the time he was a child, and at the age of 25, he bought his own parcel of land. Since then, he has been working in this business. However, during harvest season and weeding he needs the help of day laborers in order to get the work done more quickly. \r\n\r\nHe feels very committed to his work, because thanks to his daily efforts, he has the enjoyment of seeing his plants give good crops.

Initially at the camp, he earned what little he could at the stone quarry but he found this inadequate since he could not provide enough food, medicine or schooling for his children. Working at LiA has greatly improved his life and now he is able to provide these basics for his family. But he is a business man at heart. He owned a shop in the north and was forced to leave it but his mind still thinks in terms of business.<br \/> <br \/> He has been able to negotiate a busness deal with a local secondary school to provide them with flour each term (three times per year). He will travel to the rural area to buy the flour and then return with it to the school. He will be able to make a profit of 200,000 each term. He will continue with his work at LiA since this business will only require his attention 3 times per year.<br \/> <br \/> He is seeking a loan in the amount of 700,000 to make the initial puchase of flour.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

They run diverse businesses, such as, among others : buying and reselling beans, soaps, and meat (grilled, as soup, etc).\r\n<p>\r\nTo meet customer demand, they decided to join the loan program of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, a Kiva's partner, from which they are seeking their first group loan. They intend to use it to buy several 100-kg sacks of beans, 5 boxes of soaps, and 3 goats to have obtain meat for restoration. The goods are sold at the Niena market, and at home, to a clientele comprising men and women. They foresee turning an average monthly profit of XOF 5'000 (ca US$ 10) each, to be in part used to provide for their families, and in part invested in their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":275493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy and resell various items (beans, soap, meet, ...)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou B.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from baking and selling bread to the local community. Marlyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baking equipment. Marlyn is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business and for her daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Eseese has 7 years of experience in this business.  Eseese needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 221 tala or US $92 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Eseese joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eseese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Eseese V. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her house is located in the district of Santa Rosa, a district with an economy mainly supported by fishing. This area is located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nDue to her husband\u2019s illness, she started working three years ago in the fresh fish business at the regional fishing terminal; she buys the fish from the boats that arrive at the terminal and then she sells it to the merchants that go to the terminal to buy the fish and then resell it at the main regional markets. This activity can only be done in the early hours of the morning. This business has provided her with a lot of support in these times and thanks to the business she can provide for her family.\r\n\r\nMartina wishes to expand her business to buy more fish, since Easter is near and fish consumption is massive during this time. For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternative for 800 Nuevos Soles that will help her reach her objective.\r\n\r\nMartina is a hard-working woman and she is fighting to get ahead in life with her family; she does not allow herself to be scared of her current situation. Her neighbors and acquaintances admire her for her determination.

He has been a farmer for 50 years, and finds the most challenging aspect of his profession to be protecting his crops against plagues that affect his plants\u2019 growth.  Over time, he hopes to buy farmland in other towns in order to increase his output and diversify the types of crops he grows.\r\n\r\nThis is his seventh loan with MFP, and he knows he must make his payments on time if he wants access to credit in the future.
