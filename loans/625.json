They are natives of the Las Flores region in the city of Masaya. They work with ADIM because they would like assistance with training to improve their business and because they would like to obtain a loan without collateral (which none of them have). They have the goal to pay their bills on time in order to maintain the loan. \r\n\r\nEstebada del Carmen Davila has sold vegetables and fruits in the Oriental market for the past 10 years. She is 45 years old and has 3 teenage children that work on their own account. She inherited this business from her mother. Her husband works in the fields and he helps only a little with the salary he earns. She needs the loan to purchase crops that are anticipated from the farms and harvested in different seasons. Generally, every fifteen days she buys fresh seasonal products. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to continue growing her small business and to buy larger quantities of fruits and vegetables that would allow her to receive better prices. She believes that she will always make her loan payments on time. She is participating in the training workshops offered by ADIM and she expresses her happiness to be learning these important things. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany

She and her husband have wanted to improve the house for 10 years.  During the summer, Flor operates a business selling cold drinks along the beach.  This extra income helps, with her husband's income, to move the project along.  Over the years, they have been working on the framing, walls and roof of their much-desired house.  Flor is happy with the progress they have made together.  Her goal now is to treat the walls for insects.  Next, she wants to tile the floors.  Her overall goal is to provide a comfortable place for her children to live.  This is Flor's first MFP loan.  She knows that it will help her to continue building her house and, consequently, she is committed to repaying the loan on time.  She will use the money from the loan to buy tubing for the house's lighting, along with sand, cement and other building materials.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

Antelma tiene una papeler\u00eda en su domicilio, negocio que inicio desde hace mas de 4 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, lo que la  motivo a iniciar este negocio en primer lugar fue la necesidad de la gente que habita en la poblaci\u00f3n, ya que existe un gran n\u00famero de ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes que estudia en diferentes escuelas dentro y fuera de la comunidad y que carecen de materiales did\u00e1cticos necesarios para elaborar sus tareas y trabajos escolares, antes de iniciar la papeler\u00eda los pobladores ten\u00edan que viajar a la ciudad de Pinotepa para adquirir sus productos, haciendo mas costosos los precios de los materiales did\u00e1cticos necesarios para la educaci\u00f3n de los estudiantes de su pueblo.\nAntelma   se uni\u00f3 a un grupo de cr\u00e9dito para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito de dinero, para la compra de material did\u00e1ctico y de papeler\u00eda, como son: libretas, cuadernos, pegamento blanco, l\u00e1pices de colores, l\u00e1pices de grafito, bol\u00edgrafos, tijeras, carpetas, cartulina, hojas de papel Bond, juegos geom\u00e9tricos, regla de medir, comp\u00e1s para trazar c\u00edrculos, \u00e1bacos, crayones, clips, cartuchos de engrapadoras, papel lustre, papel crepe.\nLas ganancias que Antelma, son destinadas par la compra  de mas  materiales y mercanc\u00eda necesaria para su papeler\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n para cubrir los pagos de su cr\u00e9dito. Otro de los proyectos que esta admirable mujer va a emprender es un ciber caf\u00e9, por la necesidad de este servicio en su comunidad, ya que las personas que estudian carecen de esta indispensable herramienta para su preparaci\u00f3n escolar.\nLa esperanza que tiene Antelma, es tener buena salud para seguir aportando los medios necesarios que su pueblo requiere para un buen  desarrollo, hacer crecer su negocio, mejorarlo en todos los aspectos, ampliar su papeler\u00eda, impulsar sus proyectos, y que su situaci\u00f3n familiar siempre este estable y llena de armon\u00eda y comunicaci\u00f3n.\nLo que mas desea es que  sus compa\u00f1eras de grupos no dejen de hacerse responsable con su cr\u00e9dito que a todas ellas les valla de lo mejor, de igual manera desea que los ni\u00f1os que dependen de estas familias no les falte nada.\nAntelma agradece la confianza que le da fundaci\u00f3n realidad, al otorgarle su cr\u00e9dito, a Kiva que sin conocerlas le brindan este gran respaldo econ\u00f3mico.\nEl grupo \u201cDalias de Rancho Viejo\u201d, se conforma por un total de 13 mujeres, que a continuaci\u00f3n se dan los nombres de las personas que lo integran, as\u00ed como su actividad personal de cada integrante.\n\nYuvanitzi Semei F.

It is about 17 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional.  The name comes from the dahlia flower for its unique beauty and because each of the members feels represented by and identifies with this floral species.  The group is made up of 13 women and their representative is Mar\u00eda Isabel R. M..\r\n\r\nWe will focus this narrative on the life of Antelma R. C. who is 45 years old and married to Rosaelio who is 44.  He is an elementary school teacher.  They have 3 children, Cinthia who is 9 and in 4th grade, Darinel who is 8 and in 3rd grade and Rosaelio who is 6 and just started first grade.  Antelma has a stationers business in her home and has been working at this for over four years.  She set up the business because there was a need for school materials for all the children who study in the community.  Before she began her business everyone had to go to the city of Pinotepa to buy everything and this made it all more expensive.\r\n\r\nAntelma joined the group to apply for a loan to buy school materials and stationery suppliers such as notebooks, binders, glue, colored pencils, lead encils, pens, scissors, folders, cardboard, Bond paper, geometric games, rulers, compasses, abacus, crayons, clips, staples, tissue paper, crepe paper.\r\n\r\nAntelma's earnings are used to buy more materials and goods for her store and also to pay back her loan.  This admirable woman also wants to set up a cyber cafe because her community needs one and the students do not have this very necessary tool available for their education.\r\n\r\nAntelma hopes to have good health so she can continue contributing to the needs of her town.  She wants to develop and expand her business and improve it in all regards.  She wants to carry out all her projects and maintain a stable, harmonious lifestyle for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat she hopes for most is that her group colleagues are able to pack back the loan, and that things go well for all of them so that their children have what they need.\r\n\r\nAntelma appreciates the confidence shown by Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and by Kiva in granting this type of economic support.

After working in the multiservice industry (which offers clients access to legal, notary, and tax services) for 10 years, Perla realized that she could offer these services to a community that she felt needed them most.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Monterrey, Mexico, Perla began working in the multiservices industry in the U.S. when she was 16, gaining experience as a notary with a local multiservice company in Houston, Texas. The work was immediately gratifying to Perla because, as she says, she was \u201cdoing something for somebody that they wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of on their own.\u201d From her first job, Perla worked constantly to better herself and the community around her. Growing up with a strong sense of family values, she balanced work, school, and family responsibilities as she grew her experience in the business. \r\n\r\nWhile Perla valued all of the clients she served in the early years of her career, she found working with clients in the Hispanic communities in Houston particularly fulfilling. Many of these clients were members of low-income families with little or no education on how to complete the complex legal forms necessary to live in the United States. Because she was helping people with such unique needs, these clients quickly found a place in Perla\u2019s heart. As a result, she slowly began to work independently with non-English speakers and their families to manage and file complicated immigration materials alongside her full-time work with larger multiservice companies.\r\n\r\nNow, at 26, Perla is ready to take her business expertise to the next level. She says that she has been ready to start her own business for a few years but has been unable to do so for financial reasons. With this loan, she will make her dream come true. She will use the money to purchase office equipment and supplies for her at-home office space, professional business software to design a website and print business cards, and a color laser printer to offer her clients more prompt and reliable printing and copying services. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she hopes for her business in the coming years, Perla remains faithful to her family-oriented upbringing: \u201cI hope to turn this into a family business\u2026.to move our business into a location where our services are most needed.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout her loan, Perla says she wouldn\u2019t have been able to turn her dream into a reality. With this in mind, her advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is to \u201cnever give up on your dreams. It might take a while, but, if you stay with it, something good is bound to happen.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":8675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8675,"image":{"id":803747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She has a long walk to leave and get to the community.  There are many corn fields in her neighborhood that the residents plant to have corn and make hand-made tortillas and they use the grass to feed their animals.  Planting corn is very hard work and takes a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nPascuala is 19 years old and has been in a common law relationship for two.  She lives in her in-laws\u2019 house and has a one-year-old son.  Her husband works as a bricklayer and knows how to do a lot of things related to construction work while Pascuala raises pigs to sell and have some profits.  \r\n\r\nShe mentions that pigs and sheep are the animals people seek to make food when they have parties or to be able to sell, like people who sell tacos, for example.  Because of this she decided to raise pigs.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest difficulty is the feed because they eat a lot and spend all day eating and because she does not have a lot of grass available to feed them she has to buy it sometimes.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He dreams of starting another branch of his business and having two stores that sell the same products.  He wants to increase his earnings to better support his family, because his salary and his wife's salary are not enough to cover the necessary household expenses.  He also wants to start purchasing his products wholesale because his is the only hardware store in town.  By purchasing wholesale, he can offer a wider variety of products and increase the size of his store.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Juan owns a hardware store in the town of Quezalguaque.  He has owned this business for 5 years.  Don Juan began his business when he was searching for a source of income more secure than agriculture.  Agriculture is seasonal and does not produce the daily income necessary to support his family.  For them, he decided to start a business that would be productive, such as a hardware store.  They started the business in their home and like all businesses, they began with only a few products, such as: nails, hammers, screws and other tools.  This made it difficult to attract clients, but with time, they expanded their inventory more to satisfy their clients.<p>\r\nThis loan is capital to purchase more tools, drills and other items, for

Loty is married and has 11 adult children. She has had a \"sari-sari\" \u2014 general store \u2014 for over five years, and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Loty joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid her previous loan from PMPC and is now requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional goods to sell. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Loty from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

They hope to strengthen this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso so that supplies will not run out. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":526818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase charcoal                                                                               ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydie  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"D\u00e9vora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746640},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779213},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961415},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699533},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913431},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180604},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476583},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":76133.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613368}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T23:07:40Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Arnold","image":null}},{"id":198333,"name":"Almohada Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Almohada est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas trabajadoras, emprendedoras y decididas provenientes del barrio Camilo Ortega que se encuentra ubicado en la zona sur de Managua.

Philip is a home inspector running his own business, F. Home Inspections. He inspects the condition of homes, checking for electrical, structural, or any other problem.  He also inspects for insects. \u201cI have a pest control business license and I want to expand that side of my business. In a non-conventional way.\u201d  With the rise of bedbugs across the country, Philip sees a real need for these services. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming an epidemic.  \u2026To be able to do an inspection of a house with a canine will be very valuable.\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the worst parts about bedbugs is the psychological impact. \u201cIt really messes with people\u2019s heads,\u201d and bedbugs are very hard to find. \u201cOn a typical inspection you have to pull carpets back, look at small crevices \u2013 you can\u2019t really find them.\u201d  That\u2019s why Philip says inspections with a dog work well. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t find them, now the customers have the assurance that they\u2019re not there.  And that\u2019s providing another service, beyond finding it.  It\u2019s peace of mind when you don\u2019t find it.\u201d \r\n\r\nPhilip F. comes from a construction family \u2013 his father was a builder and his mother, a realtor.  For a few years Philip would buy houses to live in, rehabilitate them and then sell them. \u201cEverything leads me back to construction.\u201d In 2003, he went into business as a home inspector and opened his business.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge Philip has faced in recent years has been the slowdown in the economy and especially the housing market. \u201cBut our business has grown even in this declining market.  And I know the reason why. If you provide a service above what clients expect at a price less than they expect to pay, they\u2019ll recommend you.  \u2026it\u2019s a win-win.  Everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, Philip relies on savings to some extent.  \u201cOur business generates significant income, but it\u2019s cyclical.  People don\u2019t move as much during the holidays, so they don\u2019t inspect homes as much.  \u2026You never know, being an independent business \u2013 there\u2019s no guaranteed paychecks.  So you tend to be conservative when the market\u2019s slower.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip has been planning on getting an insect detection dog for about 18 months.  He first approached his bank. \u201cThey declined my loan.  After I applied to ACCION Texas-Louisiana, the bank reconsidered and offered me a loan, but I turned them down.  Because I was already set to close with ACCION.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan will cover part of the cost of the dog and Philip\u2019s expenses while going through handler training.  \u201cIt takes two weeks for them to train you, so I have to pay for hotels while that\u2019s happening.\u201d  Philip will pay for the rest out of his savings. \u201cI will use the loan to bridge that gap.  I don\u2019t get the dog until March, which is when business picks up.  That\u2019s when most people start to move and house hunt.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip is providing for his wife, two young sons and two step-daughters with this business.  Another reason why he wants to expand the business is because \u201ceventually everyone has to retire.  In order to do that you need to generate passive income. Hopefully these two businesses will provide that for me and my family.  \u2026When you get to be 60 years old you don\u2019t want to be on a second-story roof, 80 feet in the air.  And then if my sons want to go into this business, they can do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip advises other business owners that \u201cyou just have to take a chance.  You have to take a risk.  That\u2019s what\u2019s so cool about Kiva \u2013 there\u2019s so many diverse people trying to take a chance. And I want to be part of that.\u201d\r\n\r\nPhilip has been very excited to discover Kiva.  Since learning about it through his loan application, he has made two loans to other Kiva

John Carlos started this business after he gained four years of experience working for a company that sold hardware.  He decided to become independent so that he could start his own business.

These products also have high turnover.  With his Kiva loan, he will also take advantage of bids being generated this month at commercial auctions where products that have low turnover are being offered at good prices.  John Carlos manages his business mainly through cash sales and credit payments he collects on a weekly basis.  Lately most of the cash stays in his wallet while he tries to recover payments each month.  He continues to pursue his dream of having a growing business and reaching his personal potential so that his family can be successful in the future.

His son is in the third grade, while his daughter is not yet old enough for school. His wife doesn't have an official job, but earns extra money each week by offering washing and ironing services, and this money goes towards household expenses. Eliezer's salary goes toward loan repayments and other living expenses. \r\n\r\nEliezer has worked for the Juigalpa Municipal Council for twelve years as a night watchman. He also receives a monthly voucher which the council awards to its workers, which helps him financially. This will be his second loan, and it will be used to continue construction on his home. With his first loan he built walls up to the height of the doors. With this loan he will buy the rest of the stones needed for construction, and perlines and zinc for the roof. Eliezer has shown that he is making a great effort to build a home and provide shelter to his wife and children. It is very sad to have to share a residence with other people who have different personalities, where the children and parents suffer for not having their own roof over their heads. Thanks to the agreement that the council has with AFODENIC, Eliezer will very soon fulfil the greatest dream of his life, which is to provide a good home for his family.\r\n<br

This is Atuganile M., a 28-year-old woman from Mbeya. She is married, and she has three children who are between the ages of 12 and 16.  In addition, she is responsible for supporting two dependants who are orphans. <p>\r\n\r\nSince 2005, Atuganile has been operating a cosmetics shop.  Specifically, she purchases cosmetics at wholesale prices and then sells the cosmetics at retail prices for a profit.  She works at the business 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and she is assisted by one employee.  Atuganile currently earns approximately $200 per month.  She is requesting a loan in the amount of $625 in order to purchase a large quantity of cosmetics for her business.  In the future, she plans to start a new business.  Atuganile thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":287754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

He lives in his own house with his wife, Veronica who is 41, and his two dear children, for whom he wants to provide a better life.  With the support of his wife, Sabino\u2019s farms have become very fertile and productive.  And this is because everyday they work together on their land, making their crops better each time.  During the harvest season, they prepare to bring their products to the wholesale market in the town of Tarma, where they usually get paid well.  He has been doing this for 21 years and what he likes best about his job is growing his peas and potatoes.  He believes that the hardest part is having to transport their crops to the place where they are sold.  Over time, he hopes to put a small selling post at the market for his wife, that way they can increase profits by selling their own production.  This is his ninth MFP loan.  He has been very punctual in his previous loans and expects to be again.  In his community group he is a very responsible partner and is always aware of the agreements they have in their group.

Epifanio es un hombre trabajador, se dedica con mucho esmero a la labor que realiza.

La cantidad de frutos que recolecta son llevados a las empresas acopiadoras, en donde le remuneran muy bien por cada kilogramo que vende. El problema de su trabajo radica en no poder combatir con los insectos quienes se encargan de da\u00f1ar los frutos de las plantas.

He lives with his partner, 48 year-old Juana, and the couple have four children who bring happiness to their home.  They live in their own home, in the community of Vista Alegre Baja.\r\n\r\nEpifanio is a hard-working man who puts a lot of care into the work that he does.  He is a farmer.  He owns four hectares of land where he grows cacao, coffee and barbasco plants which, through a lot of effort, he has managed to make very productive.  He has been working for twenty years and so has a lot of experience.  However, he knows that the work is hard and he hires day laborers when it is the season to harvest and weed his fields.  He takes the fruit that he harvests to middlemen who pay him very well for every kilogram of produce that he sells.  The problem in his work lies in not being able to fight the pests which damage the fruit on his plants.  However, his main priority right now is buying new land as he doesn't have enough space to continue sowing.\r\n\r\nThis is Epifanio's fifth loan from MFP and he pledges to continue making his repayments on time as he did with his previous loans.  He is grateful to the other members of his community bank for electing him as president of the board of directors.  He will use the loan he has requested to buy cacao plants which he will then sow using modern technology."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":774613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifanio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098444}],"funded_date":"2011-05-25T20:01:26Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":304889,"name":"Memunatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Memunatu sells food items such as salted fish, oil, soaps, rice, steel-wool and other items at Abura.

The children range in age from 9 to 18.  They live in the Soledad municipality, a metropolitan area in Barranquilla.  \r\n\r\nThat is where she has a store where she sells everyday food products and merchandise like cosmetics, women\u2019s accessories, clothes, shoes, stationery items, and plastic products.  She started the business 14 years ago when she was let go from the important chain of stores where she worked.  She used this money for her entrepreneurial adventure.\r\n\r\nShe started with two display cases on the terrace of a rented house, which is located in front of her house.  In less than one year she managed to buy it.  With the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo she expanded her business and paid for her son\u2019s university education.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue being successful with an increase in her working capital.  That is the reason she turns to Kiva and makes use of her Kiva loan.  She wants to buy stationery products, accessories, and novelty items.  She will receive them in the month that requires more investment in the businesses.  This is when sales increase due to the celebration of Valentine\u2019s Day (day of love and friendship).  Children\u2019s and adults\u2019 purchases increase.  Everyone wants to show their affection with gifts for their friends, boyfriends and girlfriends, family members, and neighbors.  Indeed, Nancy\u2019s customers plan to go to her store to buy a nice present.  She needs to have her business stocked with everything they require.\r\n\r\nNancy maintains a contribution margin of 12%, from which we predict her successful investment and potential growth.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":864395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stationery products, accessories, and novelty items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":159056},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":171922},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":175933},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":180038},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":184239},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":198812}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.91},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.91,"local_amount":159056,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":165559.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614935},{"amount":100.42,"local_amount":171922,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":178951.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568877},{"amount":102.76,"local_amount":175933,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":183126.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780200},{"amount":105.17,"local_amount":180038,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":187399.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188595},{"amount":107.61,"local_amount":184239,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":191772.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324808},{"amount":116.13,"local_amount":198812,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":206941,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651555}],"funded_date":"2011-09-20T15:54:56Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":337686,"name":"Sevilla","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sevilla is 54 years old and lives in Sapang Dalaga.

Desde muy joven tuvo que trabajar para ayudar a su familia, y dentro de sus actividades econ\u00f3micas que realiz\u00f3 encontr\u00f3 su verdadera vocaci\u00f3n en los bordados, empez\u00f3 a realizar diversos tejidos, ya que su creatividad la hicieron reconocida dentro de las diversas f\u00e1bricas en las que trabaj\u00f3. M\u00e1s ahora adquiri\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina especial para tejidos y bordados, la cual la ayuda a seguir trabajando, pero en su domicilio, pues le llevan grandes cantidades de prendas para que realice los tejidos o diversos adornos que s\u00f3lo Ana, con su gran creatividad, puede realizar. Desde entonces se siente m\u00e1s tranquila, ya que dej\u00f3 de lado las horas de ausencia de su hogar y tiene la posibilidad de trabajar y cuidar a su familia. Ahora tiene el anhelo de mejorar sus servicios con maquinaria m\u00e1s especializada o con instrumentos que le faciliten el arduo trabajo, pues algunos d\u00edas tiene que terminar de bordar o tejer desde 100 a 300 prendas. Ana tiene una gran simpat\u00eda con su equipo de trabajo, pues dentro del grupo viene trabajando m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os en MFP, le grada sentirse \u00fatil para realizar algunas tareas administrativas, las que le han ido ayudando en el trascurso de su permanencia. M\u00e1s ahora este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo individual, fuera de su grupo, pues requiere mayor capital de trabajo. Con la finalidad de adquirir algunas herramientas o telares para sus trabajos, Ana opt\u00f3 por solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo de 3000 soles que ser\u00e1n invertidos en la compra de sus materiales de trabajo.","en":"Ana, 38, is a doting mother of two small children, her treasures, and she and her husband try to give them the best.  For that, they bought a house that cost a lot of build.  From the time she was a girl, she's had to work hard to help her family and, among the jobs that she's done to earn money, she found that her true vocation is embroidery.  She started by making different fabrics because her creativity had led her to be recognized for that skill at the factories where she worked.  Later, she acquired a special machine for knitting and embroidery which allowed her to continue working--at home now--on clothing brought to her because only she, with her great creativity, could provide the level of decoration required.  Since then, she's been happier because she no longer has to be away from home.  She now has the chance to both work and care for her family.  Next she wants to improve the level of services that she provides with a more specialized machine and instruments that will ease her difficult work, work that on some days requires her to complete 100 to 300 clothing pieces.  Ana likes her working group, a group that's been working with MFP for more than 5 years, and she's grateful for the help they've provided with certain administrative tasks, something that's been very valuable during her time there.  This will be her first individual loan, outside of the group, because she needs a larger amount of working capital.

She is a married woman and she has a son in her care. She owns a used clothing business, which she runs from her own home. She has been running the business for more than three years. Karla started displaying some of her products in her home because some clients used to come to her home to view the items. But following some advice from a friend she started selling her clothing door to door. Sometimes she sells alongside her friends and her sister. The loan she is requesting will be used as working capital, to purchase t-shirts, dresses and slacks.

Her story is representative of the others in her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients. Valentina's group is based in Hato Mayor, a rural area in the Dominican Republic that has unreliable access to resources such as potable running water and electricity. Valentina lives with her two children (ages 20 and 19) and one grandson. \r\n\r\nValentina has proven she is an excellent Esperanza client by repaying seven loans. She plans to use this loan, her eighth, to continue to grow her business and buy more shoes to sell.  She hopes to someday have her own store where she can sell her shoes.

She works in her business, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faaga has many years of experience in this business.  Faaga needs a loan of WST $2750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faaga joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faaga T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

When she got married, she decided that she wanted to have a business activity and so decided to sell something which she knew how to prepare called 'humita' (basically a dough of cooked corn, lightly coated in oil, wrapped and finally toasted inside corn husks).\r\n\r\nCecibel has run her business well and now she has a high demand for 'humitas'.  She distributes them to different sellers.  She starts cooking her 'humitas' at 7.00am.  She produces 100 in the morning and 100 in the afternoon.  Occasionally she sells her 'humitas' in different villages and towns with the help of her husband.  Her business is located in the front of her home because she still doesn't have fixed premises.

Pose has been selling food including Rina cooking oil, tomatoes, onions, potatoes and other vegetables for 6 years. Her initial funding of $5 was given to her by her little brother and she used it to start a business selling grilled corn on the side of the road. She has since successfully completed 5 loan cycles with Hekima and will use this new loan to buy 3 baskets of tomatoes and a sac of potatoes, and to finance other small family projects.

Angelina started a business butchering pigs, work that she learned from her mother and that she's been doing since she was a girl.  She needs a loan to buy live pigs which she will butcher.

second loan cycle through Esperanza International. The group members all live in Villa Mella, which is located in the northern outskirts of Santo Domingo, which is Dominican Republic\u2019s capital city. Evelyn R. and Josue A. are the group coordinators. Evelyn has five children. The youngest is 12 years old. All her children still live with her. She sells shoes, which she purchases in Dajabon (a city in the northwest of the Dominican Republic, which is about a 5 \u00bd hour ride from Santo Domingo) as well as in the capital. With this loan, she will buy mostly tennis shoes and sandals. She explains that depending on the time of year, sales increase on a certain kind of shoe (for example, loafers during back-to-school time). Evelyn hopes her profits from selling shoes will allow her to buy a house of her own. This would let her have a more peaceful life. Josue has four children of ages 10, 8, 6 and 3. His current business is selling clothes. He finds greater demand for women\u2019s clothing. Lately, however, he has noticed that people are not buying as much as usual. He will use this second loan to purchase new clothes to sell. During his interview, he commented that he likes the fact that because all the members of his group paid their first loan on time, Esperanza International approved higher loan amounts for them in this second loan cycle. He hopes to continue that trend so he can invest larger amounts in his business and create sustainable growth.

This is 53-year-old Eva R. from Mwanza. She is married with five children between the ages of 22 and 27 years old. Eva has been running a poultry business since 2002. Her business is the poultry\/kuku business. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nShe works at the business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Eva currently earns about 150USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to expand her business. In the future, she plans to renovate her poultry house. Eva thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business.

(Bank of Hope) Mujeres Solidarias (Women United). Her story is representative of those in her group and more generally of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients. Her group is based in Hato Mayor, a small rural area of the Dominican Republic. Her house does not have running water and she has unreliable access to electricity.  She lives with her husband and four children (ages 19, 18, 16, and 15). \r\n\r\nSanta has successfully repaid five loans with Esperanza and is seeking a sixth loan to buy more items to sell in her store.  She sells various items for the house including sheets, kitchen items, pillows and interior decorations.  She plans to invest in plastic chairs with this loan to sell in her store. \r\n\r\nSanta has been able to improve her life with the profits she has made from her business.  She recently purchased a stove for her house and hopes to someday purchase a washing machine for her house.  She likes working with Esperanza because it encourages her to work hard and work together with all of those in her group.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

M. was born in the Namaacha district, neighboring the Kingdom of Swaziland, in the province of Maputo. She is 30 years old, married, and mother of 3 children aged between 7 and 13, who attend school.  She attended school until the 5th grade but dropped out due to a lack of resources, as she was abandoned by her mother and was left in the care of her grandmother.   She lives in her own home with her family, and supports her grandmother and mother, who live with her.   \r\n\r\nShe left Namaacha for the city of Matola during the war, two years later she returned to her hometown.  She started her business very young, because her grandmother did not have a way to support her.  She has her own business and is owner of a shop that sells basic goods such as rice, sugar, soap, and soft drinks.  She does not have employees, and counts on the help of her children.  She works from 6am to 11pm and earns around 4.000.00mt per month, which she uses for household expenses and for construction.  She manages to save 1.500.00mt per month because she has the help of her husband who is a teacher. \r\n\r\nThis is Ana's third loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  The first two loans were for 7.000.00mt and 10.000.00mt which she used to purchase basic goods, and she is requesting this third loan for 15.000.00mt for the same purpose.  She is confident that she will pay back her loan without any problems and request another loan to complete her construction project.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele

She has a daughter.  She is a widow, and she sells in a town that is close to her house.\r\n\r\nShe needs another loan in order to continue selling butchered chicken to her customers.  Similarly, she wants to be able to have her income grow.  Chicken is a basic food that it is always consumed; and her sales grow a bit more.  There is more demand for her Saturday sales at the Villas del Quetzal neighborhood because on Sundays she rests.  \r\n\r\nDuring the time that she works there are not many people who sell chicken that is fresh.  There were no problems with the loan.  Her biggest wish is to be able to keep selling more and to be able to have a person help her sell in another location.  This will generate more income, and she would also be able to continue giving her daughter the necessities. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":803944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicken to butcher.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Raymundo, Guatemala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":291.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.59,"local_amount":875.72,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":876.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227659303},{"amount":37.41,"local_amount":291.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":291.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232785248},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589626},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547687},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758273},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-21T08:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258112851},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297310},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:10:54Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016627},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":291.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206691},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":291.34,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":291.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315760}],"funded_date":"2011-08-01T10:22:41Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T14:52:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":317214,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jocelyn is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a welding shop business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 23,000 through NWTF to buy additional materials and equipment for her welding shop.\r\n\r\nJocelyn has been in this business for 13 years.

Her husband works as a driver for cargo. Areej wants to pay for making repairs and painting the vehicle, as it is the only source of income for the family, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for these expenses. Therefore, she needs to take a loan of $2,000 from FATEN. When Areej gets her FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to pay for all these expenses and improve the vehicle the family has. Her husband will serve more clients and work extra to have a better income and improve the family living conditions. Areej is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead next to the vehicle the family

After finishing high school, Yura went to the Kapan technical college and graduated with a diploma in construction. So far Yura is single and lives together with his parents.\r\nYura\u2019s whole family has been doing farm work for seven years. On his own land plot, Yura grows apples for sale. Since his own  plot is small, he also leases [additional] land for growing potatoes for sale, using the rest  as grazing land for his livestock.

He works offering transportation to passengers between the various zones where he lives.  For this reason, he owns a motorcycle taxi, which he has been using for his job for 3 years.  What he likes about his job is giving his passengers a good experience and above all the confidence necessary during the trip.  This job is profitable since he drives himself and does not have to hire a driver.  Also, he manages and takes care of the business by himself.  In the future, he would like to have a mechanic shop since he studied mechanics, and wishes to put his profession in practice.  This is his second loan with Kiva partner MFP.  He likes to work with his communal bank, because they offer him an opportunity that others are not able to provide.  For this, he is very thankful.  With the money that he is requesting, he wants to send in his motorcycle taxi for repairs, and then purchase clothing and shoes to resell in order to earn extra money.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":276547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Motorcycle taxi repairs and the purchase of clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T07:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":228.72},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":234.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":243.79},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":254.94},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":265.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":273.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.96},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.43,"local_amount":228.72,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":237.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117173},{"amount":74.13,"local_amount":234.11,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":242.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012084},{"amount":77.2,"local_amount":243.79,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":252.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595669},{"amount":80.73,"local_amount":254.94,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":264.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989931},{"amount":83.96,"local_amount":265.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":274.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211063},{"amount":86.55,"local_amount":273.3,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":283.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640556}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T10:21:14Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Josh Wilcox","image":392254}},{"id":95120,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 inici\u00f3 el negocio?

In order to help my children succeed, since I am their sole caregiver and I had to raise them and I also wanted all three to be able to attend school. I started the business in August 1987.\r\n\r\nAmalia started her business selling clothes and cosmetics, later she sold door-to-door with a suitcase of clothing, but her goal was to have a larger business in an established location. Now that her children are grown and married she has accomplished her goal of an established locale, since she is older now and it is tiring work to sell door-to-door or as a traveling salesperson. Thanks to the business she has been able to build two other small commercial shops, which she rents out to other business owners.  \r\n\r\nNow she requires a loan of $12,000 MXN to pay back in 12
