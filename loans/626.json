His main produce is french beans, which he sells to Evabest Horticultural Company in Murang'a town. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo for KES.50,000 to purchase farm supplies that will help him with growing french beans. He also intends to use KES.5,000 to purchase a bull. This loan will enable him to practice large scale farming without straining financially. His biggest challenge has been poor roads that delay transportation of products to the market. In the future, he hopes to expand his farming to cover 5 acres with an output of 5400 kgs per hectare at harvest.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to see a bright future through Juhudi

He has been married to his beloved wife, Carmen, for 20 years.  They have 4 children who they have lovingly raised in the a house they own near Santo Domingo.  Like all good partners, Marcial and Carmen focus on what each does best.  Maricial has operated a farming business for 25 years.  He grows peas, carrots, maize and potatoes, all of which need constant care.  He also buys and sells vegetables, traveling down to Santo Domingo once a week to sell his merchandise in the central market there.  Carmen operates a butchering business and Marcial helps her sell the meat she produces in the capital where they can get the best price for it.  \"We sometimes go together and help each other\", he says.  The businesses are important to Marcial because the income they generate have allowed him and his wife to support their family.  He wants to save enough now to send his children to university.  Marcial belongs to the Santo Domingo D. Tapo community bank.  This is his sixth MFP loan and he's grateful for the on-going help that he's received from the bank.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She lives in the Laureles Sur neighborhood, in which she runs her own general store to serve her neighbors. Eight years ago, Alba was one of the few people who received water services in the neighborhood, which is why she used to sell water to the people who did not have it. However, after all of the inhabitants were provided with water services, she had to seek a new way to make money. She and her husband decided to sell assorted products from home using their own capital. Alba started out with only a little capital, which is why she needed loans to be invested in her business. This loan will be used to purchase products such as staple grains and pulses, cleaning products, and perishable goods to invest them in her general store because she currently has little merchandise, and would like to expand and diversify her business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAlba Patricia es una joven de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene tres hijos de 18, 15 y 10 a\u00f1os.

A pesar de existir mucha competencia en el mercado laboral muchas de las socias saben como salir adelante ya que tienen a\u00f1os trabajando en su rubro y saben como salir de apuros. El destino del financiamiento es para la compra de insumos, materiales y herramientas para seguir con sus negocios por ejemplo la presidenta desea un carrito m\u00f3vil para vender sus hamburguesas y poder desplazarse m\u00e1s cuando no hay muchas ventas.  La mayor expectativa de las socias es poder tener sus puestos de trabajo con m\u00e1s  Implementaci\u00f3n, equipamiento, ampliaci\u00f3n y surtir mercader\u00eda para tener buenas  ventas en el futuro que ayudaran a brindarles a sus familias una mejor calidad de vida. ","en":"\"La Costanera\" (\"The Coast\") is led by Mrs. Maria Ylda. The group's 14 members are working with Fundaci\u00f3n AgroCapital for the second time; they have proven to be co-operative and punctual. Each member of La Costanera has his\/her own business. They sell food, baked goods, snacks, alcoholic drinks, fish, groceries and gasoline. Maria, the group leader, sells snacks and has a job making sandwiches and hamburgers. Maria is a single mother; she lives with her young daughter, her mother and her little sisters. She doesn't have to pay rent, but she works to get ahead because she wants to help her sisters get an education, and she wants to help her mother with household responsibilities. There's a lot of competition in the local labour market these days, but the members of La Costanera have experience and problem-solving skills working in their favour. They'll be using this loan to purchase the supplies, materials and tools they need for their businesses. For example, Maria wants a push-cart that she can use when selling burgers. She'd be able to move to new locations when sales in one spot taper off. The group hopes that more and better supplies and equipment will help their sales, their families and their overall quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her sister is married and lives in another city.\r\n\r\nShe sells beer and soft drinks in her home.  She also works as a salesperson in a furniture store.  She has a great desire to get ahead.  She pays to study English because she wishes to better herself little by little.  She wants to be able to study a professional career, which was curtailed because of the earthquake.  She has been supporting her mother more and saving to build her house.  She used her savings to raise the house, and now she is asking for a loan because it needs a roof.  She wants her mother to be in a good environment.  For over two years they have lived in a tent and pre-fabricated housing.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys good references from her neighbors.

To make a living, Leila owns and operates a general store where she sells food and daily-use products in the local community.

Leila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Leila is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP to purchase additional inventory and use as working capital. This will be Leila's second loan from PMPC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She tells us that she studied business at a secretary school but she never practiced it because she married. Ten years ago she decided to open a business sewing to get her family ahead. At the beginning it was difficult like in every business at the beginning.  Little by little she was able to build her clientele in her own neighborhood. They would recommend her, and little by little her business grew and the earnings increased. The family acquired another machine to produce a greater number of pieces and to have a better quality product. \r\n\r\nThe children of the group members are their inspiration source. They will use the loan to invest in their businesses. Their worry has always been for their children not to lack for anything and for their businesses to grow and be more well known in the neighborhood.

Jeanette has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Jeanette is requesting a new loan of 21000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like junk foods, canned goods & biscuits. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Jeanette from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":699362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives in the municipality of Narra, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,600. Priscilla is borrowing PHP 18,500 to continue to fund the operations of her business.  This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 16,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Priscilla aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

D. is 46 years old and married. Xiomara has two children, of the following ages: Her 16 year old son recently finished his fourth year of high school; her younger son, nine years old, finished fourth grade. Her husband is an accountant for the Enacal business. Her goal is to secure the necessary income for her investment (in her business) because the situation that we find ourselves in is very difficult, and the only form of help that now presents itself in this country are the microfinance institutions and the outside organizations that hold out their hands to us. Xiomara wants to try to advance each day so that she can improve her economic situation. Her dream is to grow her business to ensure her children will be able to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nXiomara's business is a general store in which are sold products such as: clothing, costume jewelry, shoes, and sandals. Her business is mobile. She has had her business for three years, which began with her own idea that she had to fight for. Because of this she began this business with few products and began to distribute her product but it didn't have (good) results. Not enough people (customers) paid for (bought) the merchandise, so later she decided to invest only in clothes and began to cater to her better customers to distribute her products. This loan is for operating expenses because she has to buy gold-plated (items) in Managua and men's clothing is in different places in Leon where they are sold in a favorable way. Xiomara is grateful to the Foundation and its partner organizations that are helping her get this loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Olivia Engkvist, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because he does not have a permanent job, he started his master decorator apprenticeship several years ago.  Few years passed, and Sarvar became involved in decorating apartments and houses on his own.  He currently has two apprentices, who help him complete orders decorating houses and apartments.  When he receives an order, Sarvar buys building materials.  He gets paid once work is completed and uses this income to support his family.

She is married to Edwin S., a house carpenter in their community. Her husband used to earn a labor fee of 350 PHP a day. They have seven children with ages ranging from 13 to 25 years old. Despite the hardships of life, Juliet is happy to have her family bonded and cooperative. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her general store business, Juliet is requesting additional business capital of around 22,000 PHP from Kiva lenders in order to develop her business to support her children's education. They will make her proud someday if they are able to pursue and finish college. Furthermore, Juliet dreams of developing her business into a grocery store someday, a goal for which, according to her, patience and hard work will be the key. In the meantime, Juliet is going to buy additional supplies of items such as sugar, coffee, mild detergent, fragrance soap, 10 cases of soft drinks, canned goods, sacks of sugar, etc., to retail in her store using the loan she is requesting from Kiva. She hopes to gain lenders' support in order to improve her living

A. is a 46-year-old businesswoman who has multiple activities but manages to divide her time wisely.  She lives in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City.  Her husband Prudencio, 49, is an employee. They have two children, the eldest is in college and the other is in high school.\n\nAnita is into direct selling of cosmetics.  Like most Filipina women entrepreneurs, she gets rebates from items that she gets from reputable cosmetics and apparel companies on consignment (Avon, Sarah Lee, Board Walk, Natasha, etc.) and sells them to customers on an installment basis.  She also makes rags from fabric trimmings and sells them to customers.  She also repacks and retails powder detergent.  She is also selling electronic load credits for mobile phones.  These combined activities give Anita a sure net income of at least P16,000.00 a month.\n\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005.  She has learned from the cooperative the value of saving for the future.  She used her savings for the renovation of their house.  She wishes to see all her children finish their education.\n\nAnita has applied for a new loan with the cooperative amounting to P50,000.00 as additional capital to keep her businesses going.  \n\n\n\nAbout CCT\n\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \n\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\n\n    \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":391083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"As additional capital to keep her businesses going","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T09:47:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":490,"local_amount":23333.31,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T14:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":23728.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87016664},{"amount":280,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T16:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13559.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96929204},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769920},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769921},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769922},{"amount":70,"local_amount":3333.38,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3389.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103769923}],"funded_date":"2009-09-23T10:37:35Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T11:55:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":139893,"name":"New Era Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siah N. and her fellow group members are from the Foyah Market area in the Foyah District of Lofa County.

M. is 27 years old. He lives in Col\u00f3n, in the department of La Libertad. He lives with his wife and their three children, a six-year old and twins that are barely a year old. Jorge has a microbus business (the name that small busses are called in his country), in which he brings people to offices and different workplaces. Jorge depends solely on this work to support his family, for which he requests a loan so that he can pay for the necessary repairs for the microbus and also bring it in for a tune-up. In this way, he can offer better service to his customers so that they can travel in a more secure manner. Also, he feels very fortunate to have his own means of transport that allows him to obtain earnings necessary for his family\u2019s sustenance. For this reason, Jorge feels it very important to care for the source of his work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

station.  Married to Ferdinand D. and blessed with three children, she makes it a point to balance her role as a mother, a wife and a businesswoman. \r\n\r\nOfelia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow eight times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was that she used almost all the money she borrowed to invest in her computer rental business. With the help of her business, she and her husband now earn PHP 70,000 net income per month. They also have two employees working for them.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be used mostly as a source of added capital for her expanding business. She will buy upgraded computer accessories to provide additional services for her clients. The extra profit that she will receive from this loan will be used for her children\u2019s school expenses and to improve the quality of her family's life.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her computer rental business will continue to grow and that life will be more blessed through the years. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":453643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Bakhtiyor is from Istaravshan, Tajikistan. He has been working for the past five years in agriculture and cattle. He is well known as a small producer in his community. His young son is the motivation for his many efforts and the reason why he is always looking for ways to work hard and get ahead. \r\n<p>\r\nHe has applied to IMON International with the goal of obtaining a loan to buy seeds and fertilizer for his crop. Bakhtiyor hopes the loan will allow him to increase his yield above and beyond what it was in previous years. As for his future plan, he wants all of his children to go to university and to get good jobs. You can be an important part of the growth of Bakhtiyor\u2019s business.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In terms of competition, the group members are people who produce and sell high-quality products that they make themselves, which is why they have faithful customers who help them generate the profits necessary for their family expenses. For this reason, they need this loan in order to make their businesses grow by obtaining supplies, materials and the new tools that they need to make a greater quantity of products and offer better services. Thus, they can generate more income, which will allow them to give their families a better quality of life. Regarding experience with solidarity groups, a large majority of the members have previously worked with similar microfinance institutes, but none has ever given them the support and trust that the Fundaci\u00f3n has given them so that they can make progress with their plans of growth, in so doing, giving their families a better quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

They have three grown children who live in the capital of Per\u00fa (Lima) and looking for a better future and an adequate education.\r\n\r\nShe has worked hard since she was very young.  That is why her body became accustomed to the heavy schedules and the activities she mentions.  She currently gets up very early and, accompanied by the music she likes, she starts her domestic chores.  She then takes care of her husband, and they both head to their small restaurant, which sells typical food of the jungle.  The dishes they make are popular in her area because it is the only establishment nearby.  With the earnings they get they are able to educate their children, pay the household expenses, and even expand their place of business.  In the future she wants to operate as a video pub in the evenings in order to get more income.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  She is sure that she will make her payments punctually, as always, in order to not lose the confidence that the institution and her group has placed in her.  She also mentions that she is happy to be part of a communal bank because her colleagues follow the rules, and this makes them very united.  Alida plans to use the money she is requesting to buy toys to sell, taking advantage of the end of the year parties.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":470543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T20:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":59.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124443},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":59.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960184},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":59.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993028},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":59.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717814},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":59.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751489},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":59.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933956}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T21:37:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":172981,"name":"Isela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isela J. is currently in the business of selling charcoal at home and is requesting a loan to stock more charcoal to sell.
