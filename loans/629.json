She has two children who still depend on her, and lives in the El Cortijo sector of the Trujillo province.  <p> \r\n\r\nLuz started in the business of selling juices by traveling throughout the city.  Subsequently, with the credit she received from Manuela Ramos, she added a display case in her house for cakes and bread.  With both her savings, as well as later loans, she has outfitted her small store.  She now has a well-stocked store in her home, and she continues with her sales of juices.  She no longer travels around to sell her goods, but is instead able to do so from her own home.  <p> \r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the collective bank \u201cLuz Divina\u201d (\u201cDivine Light\u201d) where she obtained her first loan of 300 soles (Peruvian currency).  With the loan of 750 soles (approximately $275USD), to be repaid over six months, she will buy sodas, fruit and beer to sell in her store.  Given that it is the summer season now, these products are in great demand.  <p> \r\n\r\nLuz is very happy with what she has achieved, having initially suffered greatly at the hand of her husband.

She lives with her partner and her two children in her parent's house. Working the earth is part of her life, her only source of income, and an activity she carries out with her husband. Yesi has a baby that she must take care of, for whom she feels very sad when her baby cries while she is carrying out her work in the small farm, carrying him on her back. And as a mother she feels very helpless since she can't offer her little one any comfort, since if Yesi does not work in the field, her husband alone does not make progress with the work. Now they are planting potatoes in the land that her father loaned them, and her harvests have been very profitable, and for this she feels very happy. With this type of work, her parents are comfortable, and she hopes to reach this too, for the well-being of her family. For this, first she would like to purchase her parent's small farms to have her own land to cultivate. Yesi is a quiet woman, but she is very responsible in making her payments.

He has been working in agriculture since he was a child helping on his parents' farm.\r\n\r\nFreddy plans on using the loan from CIDRE to buy fertilizer as well as seeds for growing potatoes, corn, and parsley.

This way, he can sell to customers who come to the market in the morning looking for fresh herbs.\r\n\r\nFreddy hopes the loan will help him to increase his earnings so that he can build a better home for his family, as the one they live in now is simple and small. He also hopes to continue taking care of his elderly mother, whose health has been deteriorating.

Ph\u1ed1 is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 06. \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16.02.06).\r\n<p>\r\nPh\u1ed1 is married and has one adult-aged child.  To making a living, Ph\u1ed1 owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  Ph\u1ed1 has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3000000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Ph\u1ed1 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ph\u1ed1 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock.  She is now requesting a new loan of 4248000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and then sell.  The loan will be the 8th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Ph\u1ed1 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.  N.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   Food Vending (bananaque),  a general store and e-loading. Her husband, Francisco T., who is 46 years old, works as an electrician to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 5 and 16 years old. Ma. Lina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Lina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for the general store and bananaque (fried banana on a stick) so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Ma. Lina T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The couple has five dependent children, four of which are their own children. About nine years ago, the family moved to H\u00eadomey in the town of Abomey Calavi. Genevieve helps her husband to provide for the family. \r\n\r\nGenevieve did not attend school. To meet the family\u2019s expenses, she prepares dishes (beans with cassava flour) that she sells from her home. As a sideline, Genevieve also sells liquor. She gets her stocks in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, and also in Adja, located in Mono. Genevieve has been in this business for five years and has already obtained two loans, which were fully repaid. \r\n\r\nWith customer demand increasing steadily, Genevieve wishes to stock up on supplies and expand her business. This is why she is seeking a third loan. In the future, she would also like to sell bags of beans. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: food vending (barbeque); and buying and selling frozen products. Her husband Ernesto J., who is 45 years old, works as a multi-cab driver to earn his living. They have 4 children who are 5 to 22 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nAfricana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Africana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her to earn a monthly profit of PHP 24,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more goods to sell so that she can continue to save for the future. Her priorities are to educate her children and to repair their house. Africana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She started to develop this business after inheriting some of the livestock from her parents.  Burmabubu familiarized herself well with this trade since childhood and experienced no real difficulties with continuing the family business.  Her husband\u2019s specialty is a bit different.  He works as a physical education teacher at a secondary school.  Together, they raised five children.  The oldest daughter is thirty years old.  The youngest son is twenty-one.  Both of the daughters are married and live separately.  Two of the sons work in Bishkek, and one works for the police and lives with the parents.  All of the children and the husband help Burmabubu with the household business as much as possible.  Burmabubu\u2019s and her family\u2019s joint effort enabled them to build a big house and a barn.  The business that Burmabubu developed played a significant role in marrying off the daughters and also marrying the sons.  Burmabubu earns 1700 som ($40) per month just from milk sales.  Burmabubu\u2019s current main goal is to marry her youngest son.  However, she has to get well prepared for this by increasing the livestock headcount.  She decided to request a loan and purchase two calves for this purpose.\r\n<p>\r\nBurmabubu\u2019s group also includes Damira B., Ulbosyn A. and Darya K..\r\n<p>\r\nDamira B. is almost sixty years old.  Damira is a mother of six children.  Out of all the children, only the youngest daughter lives with the parents.  Damira is involved in animal husbandry, even though many people her age stay home and get cared for by their children.  Damira also sells milk, which allows her to fully provide for her daily needs.  Her income from milk sales is no more and no less than two thousand eight hundred som.  Damira needs a loan in order to purchase two rams.\r\n<p>\r\nUlbosyn A. is forty-seven years old.  Together with her husband, Ulbosyn is already involved in animal husbandry, sales of livestock and also sale of milk.  Their monthly income is about ten thousand som.  This is approximately one seventh of their original contribution.  Ulbosyn wants to obtain a loan and purchase four sheep.  In the future, she plans to breed sheep in a shed and use the income from sale of livestock to educate her daughter abroad.\r\n<p>\r\nDarya K. is forty-seven years old.  She raised three children.  Together with her sons, Darya breeds livestock and is involved in livestock sales, and also sells milk.  Thanks to animal husbandry, Darya raised her children without real difficulties and improved her quality of life.  She educated her children how to correctly take care of livestock and is slowly transitioning the business to them.  Darya decided to obtain a loan with the goal of purchasing four sheep for breeding.          <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":415976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy two calves","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burmabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ulbosyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Darya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":47000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6947},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7279},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":7680},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":7955},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8376},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8763}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.59},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.59,"local_amount":6947,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":7080.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838984},{"amount":170.36,"local_amount":7279,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":7419.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730770},{"amount":179.74,"local_amount":7680,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":7827.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121317},{"amount":186.18,"local_amount":7955,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":8108.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956971},{"amount":196.04,"local_amount":8376,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8537.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989777},{"amount":205.09,"local_amount":8763,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":8931.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715589}],"funded_date":"2009-10-29T05:02:53Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":152504,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet R. is from the village of Dullan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a rural area, located \u00bd hour from the district of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, she has dedicated herself to selling basic needs products and groceries from a store located in her house. The business is very busy, as it is the only one like it in the zone.  In addition, she raises and sells small livestock.  With the income she generates, she helps her husband cover the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresa would like to expand her business by buying more groceries with which to supply her store and, therefore, increase her earnings.  For this reason, she has requested her first loan of 1,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa in order to meet her goal.  \r\n\r\nTeresa is a calm and responsible woman.  Her greatest wish is to continue to grow as an entrepreneur in order to improve her family\u2019s standard of living. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":619416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more groceries for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chacupe - La Victoria - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-10-20T19:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":74.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":74.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":80.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":90.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":95.79},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.03},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.49},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.84,"local_amount":68.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555178},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":71.2,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530583},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":74.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":77.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666693},{"amount":27.88,"local_amount":74.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410025},{"amount":30.03,"local_amount":80.08,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108454},{"amount":31.22,"local_amount":83.25,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":86.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270595},{"amount":31.49,"local_amount":83.98,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":87.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137265},{"amount":173.9,"local_amount":463.74,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":484.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211209784}],"funded_date":"2010-10-21T00:14:12Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:59:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":243354,"name":"Magongola Zinunula Group-Mityana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"46 year old Robina N. who belongs to Magongolo Zinunula Omunaku group in Mityana has for the past 10 years been operating a bakery business in Magongolo, an up and coming trading center.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  making leather straps and a general store. \r\n\r\nFeliciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Feliciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly income of approximately $300, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her businesses and for the renovation of their house. \r\n\r\nFeliciana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This group is represented by Cerrano Cruz, she has three children and works as an aesthetician. She is requesting this loan to buy beauty products for her salon such as hair dyes, bleaching dyes, curlers, and moisturizing creams, among other products. \r\n\r\nOther group members include Alejandrina L\u00f3pez M., who is 53 years old and married to Fernando D\u00edaz Nicol\u00e1s, who is a farmer. Alejandrina prepares homemade tortillas, tamales, sweet corn, squash, watermelon, and jicama. She sells about a third of what she prepares, and keeps the rest for her family's consumption. Alejandrina uses the maize and dried maize leaves (totomoztle) to make tamales. She sells all her products from a cart in front of her home and advertises her products through a car-mounted loudspeaker.   \r\n\r\nThis work has helped her family a lot, as she is able to feed and provide education for her children. Alejandrina says that despite farming many crops, she doesn't earn much from the harvest due to crop pests or too much rain. The family also consumes much of what is produced on the farm. Currently, Alejandrina's sales are good and she needs to buy some ingredients to continue making her food products. This is why she is requesting a loan to buy ingredients for making tortillas and tamales, such as whitewash (to coat the inside of the wood-burning oven), a tortilla pan, firewood, lard, chilies, onions, pork and chicken.\r\n\r\nThe following individuals are group members:\r\nCristina X Ram\u00edrez: Age 49, needs to purchase thread to embroider napkins that she sells.\r\nClaudina M.

This is her third loan with Afodenic which she wants to invest in fixing the ceiling of the room she lives in as it is quite deteriorated and she would like it to be in good condition to protect and care for her baby. Her objectives for the future are to be able to change jobs and improve her standing professionally and personally.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva

She has a small kiosk on the main street.  By buying 1,500 shillings worth of vegetables to resell, Rose can make between 250 and 500 shillings each day.  She averages between 10 and 15 customers each day, but the traffic at her small stand can fluctuate quite a bit.  Rose established her stand in 1997, and has never seen food prices rise as fast as they are now.  The added expense of purchasing her stock has pinched her profit margins.  That is on top of the struggles she faced during the post-election violence in Kenya in 2007.  Her small stand was burned and her entire stock of vegetables was destroyed.  However, two months later, she was back at it with a rebuilt business.  \r\n\r\nWith her loan, Rose would like to buy a bigger selection and a larger quantity of vegetables.  She would also like to start selling basic medicines and nutrients for sick members of her community.  She has two children, ages 14 and 8 months.  She takes her 8-month-old daughter to work with her since she doesn\u2019t have anyone to watch her during the day.\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She is a single mother of 3 daughters who are between 19 and 26 years old.  All of them go to school.  She studied through the 7th grade but was not able to finish due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in government housing and supports her father, who lives in Zavala.  \r\n\r\nTeresa left Inhambane for Namaacha District on the border with Swaziland due to her father's transfer.  She has worked for the District government for more than 31 years and is also head of the town.  She earns 6,000 MZN each month, which she uses to pay for household expenses.  She is able to save some from time to time in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks.  This is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva; it has a value of 20,000 MZN, which she plans to use to buy construction material (cement, iron, etc.) in order to continue working on her house.

She earns her living by operating a general store and pig fattening business. Her husband Federico D., who is 48 years old, works as a carpenter and farmer to earn his living.  He also helps in his wife.  They have four children who are 17 to  21 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Elena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past seven cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Elena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy piglets and for additional capital so she can continue to save up for the future education of children.  Ma. Elena D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":559147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T00:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

Located on the outskirts is a sanctuary that is known for its beautiful landscape and for being the place where the monarch butterfly chooses to hibernate.  After hibernation, the butterflies migrate to the United States and Canada.  The group is named after the area where they live, since it is represented by the monarch butterfly, and its members are proud to live near this sanctuary.  The eleven women of the group are married.  Most of them have groceries businesses, while the remaining women operate businesses in which they grind corn.  They are requesting a loan to expand their businesses by selling corn, soft drinks, and bread since these products generate good sales in this area.

Gratefully with the passage of time her arduous work yielded results and she was able to purchase a small plot of land with a small living space equipped with sleeping mats, located in the district of Ventanilla. Today, at the age of 37, she remembers the effort that her mother, her siblings and that she herself invested on the different businesses they had and what they had to do to generate an income for the family. There hasn't been anything that she didn't do, including the crafting of jewelry (fashion jewelry), gelatin sales, prepared chicken meals (business where prepared chicken dishes are sold), clothing sales, and others. She still has many business ideas in mind. Currently she has a small grocery store which she has been supplying incrementally to obtain the profits that she wants. Liliana doesn't think that anything is difficult pertaining to her work, saying that one must only put a lot of energy and effort and success will soon follow. She hopes to expand her business and to keep exploring new business ideas. Her imagination never stops with respect to business ideas.

His business allows him to properly support his spouse and five children, three of which attend school.

He is 47 and married with four children.  He does not have a formal education, but he works as an on-demand apartment repairman.  This job allows him to earn money, but the work is seasonal and there is not always demand for repairs.  The money he receives is not enough to feed his family, so he also raises livestock.  Sangimurod buys calves, fattens them over 40-45 days, and then sells them on at a profit.  He has been doing this for ten years.  This business is popular and widely accepted in rural places, and for this reason it brings him income.  At the moment, the amount of money Sangimurod can put into his business has decreased and he needs a loan to purchase more livestock.  This will allow him to re-establish his business and bring his family needed income.  He plans to repay the loan within twelve months.\r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0425\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432

This business is the main source of income for her family because Anorhol's husband is temporarily unemployed.

R. lives in Jaloliddini Rumy.  She is married and has three children.  She has a higher education.  She works in a dining hall.  She bakes pies and sambusas (Tajik dumplings).  She sells these at the market.  Because the price of flour is growing, she has decided to take out a loan to buy flour.  This will allow her to maintain her low prices and thus attract new clients.  This way, she can earn more and further help her family.

When he started he only offered tailoring services, but with experience he became skilled at sewing and now he designs his own clothes.  He works Monday to Wednesday, and Thursday and Friday he travels to other cities to sell his merchandise to clothing vendors.  He sells wholesale and his profit margin is very good when he has high sales and contact with new customers.  In the future, Ulises would like to expand his horizons and sell his clothes in other cities.  This is the first time he has received a loan with MFP and he is very happy with the opportunity to work, improve, and grow.  The money he is requesting will be used to purchase basic sewing materials, such as fabric, threads and other tools so he can increase production.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele

Knowing that his current cab needed upgrading to meet more rigorous safety requirements, Fabian's family urged him to contact ACCION USA for a micro-loan.\r\n\r\nFabian\u2019s loan will be used to purchase a new car, without which he would lose his livelihood. Since both Fabian's family in New York and his relatives in his native Ecuador rely on his income, Fabian is very glad that he was able to get the financing needed to keep his business afloat. While he was able to learn how to navigate New York City streets on his own, he credits ACCION USA with helping him navigate the US financial system.\r\n\r\nFabian hopes to eventually save enough money to buy a house here, and realize his own American Dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9000,"image":{"id":479733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

She lives in a traditional family in the Sokala district in the town of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative district of Mali).  In addition to being an administrative secretary, she is also a merchant. She has learned this trade very early on from her parents who were merchants as well. She has started her business by selling cereals, and later also various other items imported from Burkina Faso. Back then, she was an intermediary in the selling chain; she would purchase goods from wholesaler and sell them to her customers, mostly her co-workers. After she lost her job, in order to avoid being idle, she continued with her business, concentrating on it more fully.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to better meet customer demand, especially in view of approaching holidays: Tabaski (Eid), Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve, she decided to continue collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso and request another loan. She has been with Soro Yiriwaso for 42 months. She already had three solidarity loans and two individual loans, all duly repaid. She is now on her third individual loan, which she plans to use for purchasing four boxes of perfumes and 15 shirts. She stocks up in Burkina Faso and sells for cash and on credit to a customer base composed of both men and women.  She plans to achieve a monthly income of 40,000 West African Francs, which will allow her to repay her loan and help her husband. Her goal is to expand her business further.

Silvia has one daughter aged 9 and studying in the fifth grade of primary school.  Her partner works outside the country.  Her aim is to establish an office-site so that from there she can take care of her home and be with her children so she will be able to care for them.  Her dream is to increase the number of products in order to offer the best so that her customers will turn to the quality that she offers as already the majority of her customers always order new fragrances from her, so she needs to look them out in order to satisfy her client\u00e8le.  Her hope is that her daughter will manage to enter into a professional career, following her studies intensely in order to obtain in the future a stable job.  \r\n\r\nSilvia's economic activity is the sale of general merchandise such as:  clothes, shoes, perfume and cosmetics.Her business is ambulatory as this is the most rapid and effective means of making sales.  Silvia began this business off her own back as from when she was small her family had taught her to work hard, as a result of which from the age of 20 she had to work helping within the household expenses, so started travelling alone to Managua searching for products even though she wasn't very expert which caused some problems as she wasn't able to make the different product purchases, but thanks to the sellers who took her under their wing she was able to find the places which offered the products in the most favourable forms.  Through the experiences she went, she had managed to acquire experience and thus began to improve her business, so she decided to continue with this activity.  Her motive for asking a loan is to increase her work capital so she is able to take advantage of the school-entry season for which she already has many orders: she also wants to purchase shoes. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":264306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Work capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":758.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400039},{"amount":44.88,"local_amount":897.65,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":908.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092037},{"amount":30.11,"local_amount":602.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":609.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985420},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":758.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446035},{"amount":61.48,"local_amount":1229.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956673},{"amount":538.53,"local_amount":10770.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10895.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174096}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T22:23:59Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":90956,"name":"Walid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Walid is a 40-year-old man who lives in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, with his wife and their three children.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is not easy for an illiterate person to survive financially due to the high cost of living, but Sumaira will never give up. She started embroidering for her neighborhood clients to financially help her husband. She is also a good housewife and takes care her family very well. She is the mother of one daughter and one son, both of whom are very young and have not yet started their education. Sumaira wants to give them a quality education.

taxis especiales que llegue a pagar la gente pero esto sucede raras vaces ya que los taxistas cobran caro un viaje especial porque la cerretera esta en malas condiciones y tambien porque esta un poco retirado.\nDo\u00f1a Teresa se dedica a criar puercos para venderlos despues de que esten listos los animales lleva poco mas de 3 a\u00f1os criando los animales pero nos dice que no es una actividad facil de hacer ya que depende mucho del cuidado que se le tenga para que el puerco pueda crecer sano y tambien gordito, los trabajos que hay que hacer con el animales son varios desde tener limpio el lugar donde estan como barrerles y hacer aun lado el excremento, luego ese excremento hay guardarlo para que sirva como abono para las milpas, tambien hay que vacunar a los animales, darles de comer,

lives in the community of San Pedro.  She lives in one of the neighborhoods of the community, but it isn't a neighborhood that is close to the center; if anything it's the opposite and is far away from the center.  It is worth noting that there is no public transport to get to the neighborhood, only private cars and occasionally special taxis that people can pay for, but this is rare because the taxi drivers charge a lot for a special trip because the roads are in poor condition and also because the neighborhood is somewhat removed.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Teresa works raising pigs for sale once the animals are ready.  It takes just over 3 years to raise the animals but she says that it is not an easy activity to do because it depends on the care given to the pig so that it can grow healthy and fat.  The tasks to be done for the animals are varied, from keeping the sty clean by sweeping, removing the excrement and then saving this excrement to serve as fertilizer for the fields.  She also has to vaccinate the animals, feed and water them, and also keep them in place so they don't eat more than she throws to each one.  \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Teresa, also in any time she has spare, sells sweets and corn, this is what she is doing to help with household expenses.

This is Anna M., a 42-year-old woman from Mbeya.  She is single, and she has one child.  Since 2007, has been operating a crop-selling business: she purchases crops from the farming villages and then sells the crops in her town.  She works at her business 1-4 hours per day, 6 days per week, and she is assisted by one employee.  Anna currently earns approximately $380 per month from her business. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan in the amount of $400 in order to purchase a large quantity of crops from the village.  In the future, she plans to open the same business at a new location.  Anna thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional crops fpr resale purposes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna W.
