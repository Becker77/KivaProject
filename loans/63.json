She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, an auto shop and a computer games business. Her husband, William L., who is 47 years old, works in an auto shop to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between the ages of 10 mos. and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nCherelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cherelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $420, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for improving and expanding her general store (sari-sari shop) and her computer gaming business so that she can continue to save up for a brighter future and for the education of her children. Cherelyn L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 35 years old, lives with her partner, and has two children.  Her eldest child lives independently and her youngest is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nRosa Mercedes has always enjoyed earning her own income to help her husband, who works in the house-building trade, with their household expenses and the education expenses of their eldest child.  She used the first loan that she received through her community bank to buy fruit which she sold on the sidewalk outside her house.  Things went well for a year, until the competition opened a grocery store in which they also started selling fruit and vegetables.  For this reason, she decided to change business and she now hires out a motorcycle taxi.  She receives payment every day and is thereby able to save.  She also has time to spend on other tasks such as looking after children in her home.  In this way, Rosa Mercedes works hard, day by day, alongside her husband, so that they can get ahead and make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\nRosa Mercedes will use this loan for 2,000 soles to have her vehicle serviced and make a down payment to acquire another one.  This will allow her to make more profits and save up so that she can finish building her house.  Rosa Mercedes is a tenacious woman who has a great desire to continue learning.  Her dream is to finish building her home and to set up a store where she will sell fruit from every region in Peru.

She is in a committed relationship with Jhonny who is a fisherman, with whom she lives along with her two children of 10 and 3 years of age, her sister-in-law and two nephews, inhabiting her own home. The business Liliana has is selling the fish that her partner fishes in the area's lakes such as Yarinacocha Lake.

Another portion of it she sells retail at a fish stand she has at the port. \r\n\r\nShe relies only upon her partner's support in this business, which she has had for ten years.

He is 41 years old and is married.  He went to school until the 4th grade in the old system due to the lack of conditions of his parents.  He is the father of 4 children with ages between 7 months and 13 years old.  The 4 oldest kids go to school, and the youngest is a newborn.\r\n\r\nBenedito left Gaza for Maputo alleging that he was going to study.  Having arrived in Maputo he began to work work with his father as a mason.  Years later he moved with his family to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  He started doing local work as a mason, but because his work does not pay very well in Mozambique he emigrated to South Africa.  Today he is in charge, and he works on a contract base.\r\n\r\nOver ten years ago he opened a stand in his home.  Since he works far from home and is not able to satisfy the needs of his family he thought this was the best way to help his wife while he is away.  He has visited his family 3 times in 3 months.\r\n\r\nHis business has a positive impact on the community and he is unable to satisfy the demands of his customers.  He approached hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to increase his inventory.  His best product is beer.  He buys a case for 250 and resells it for 330.  A 25kg sack of rice costs 500 and is resold for 600.  He has had monthly receipts of 3,000MT and is able to save 1,000MT per month.  He is also responsible for his parents who live with him in his house.\r\n\r\nBenedito already had a loan from a bank, and he paid it without difficulty.  This is his first with Hluvuku and with Kiva, which he will use to purchase staple products for resale.  He is confident that he will be able to pay off this loan without problems.  Even if he is absent his wife will pay.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

Elenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. Elenita is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Elenita from HSPFI.

She earns her living by operating a business buying and selling firewood\/charcoal. Her husband Paulino, who is 58 years old, works as a construction worker to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 18 and 36 years old. Three of their children have their own families and one has her own job and helps her parents run the business. Lydia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lydia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, to buy firewood and charcoal for resale so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Lydia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \n\nIn the accompanying photo, Lydia poses with the stacks of firewood that she

For this reason, Jorge has requested a loan of 2000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa. \r\n\r\nJorge\u2019s taxi service has been quite profitable and he plans in the near future to purchase his own taxicab, which will be the start of a small fleet of cabs he hopes to own and manage. Jorge is very hard-working and responsible. He has had loans from Edpyme Alternativa in the past and repaid his debt on time. Thanks to his past loans and the income from his business, Jorge was able to purchase a small plot of land where he constructed his house.

The centers are in the cities of San Franscisco and Quimbirii, where she gets good payment for the grains she produces.  \r\n\r\nShe has some land that she does not cultivate.

With this loan she will buy seed, fertilizer and pesticides. \r\nHer goal for the future is to to expand into cattle because the market is favorable for cattle right now. Alicia is married, has 3 children and owns her home. Though she never went to school and cannot read or write she knows education is important and works hard to send her children to school. The youngest one is 4 years old and will be ready to enter school next year.Alicia's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles  and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and

He takes his livestock to the pastures every morning for nourishment. Then, after caring for them for several months, he takes them to be sold, but this phase is complicated due to transportation issues.

Her first loan for 300 PEN allowed her to buy products for the sale of her \u00e0 la carte meals.\r\n\r\nEncarna currently needs a loan for 3,000 PEN.  She will use part of the money to buy items for her convenience store.  She will use the other part to buy material to fix her business\u2019 floor.  That way she will be able to give her customers better service. \r\n\r\nEncarna\u2019s goal is to set up her store and to have a greater variety of products to get more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":428865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy items for her convenience store and material to fix her business' floor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Encarna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727837},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118219},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953933},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:15Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987000},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713122},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746325}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T03:24:21Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":158641,"name":"Akwal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akwal M. is currently in the business of selling charcoal at home and is requesting a loan to purchase more bags of charcoal to sell.

They decided on this name because at the time there was a soap opera that featured a group of young women known as \u201cLas Populares.\u201d  It\u2019s also because [its members] are very well known in their neighborhood.  Development groups consist of more than ten people.  The group has a bank account and its members are required to meet every one or two weeks to make their payments.  The group is run by a representative and by a committee.  This group has 14 members and is located in the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas community of the City of Jungapeo, Michoacan. \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s representative is named Rosa Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez M..

She then decorates them with colors and designs.\r\n\r\nRosa sells her crafts to her acquaintances and has been running her business for five months.  She tells us that she enjoys her work.  Her customers say that she is a hard working and enterprising woman with a desire to come out ahead.  Her goals are to help her children get ahead and that they continue with their educations.  She also tells us that she would like to have a steady business so that she can use her income to buy school supplies and uniforms for her children for the upcoming school year.

Her customers know her as being a hard working woman who helps her husband with the household expenses, and as a good saleswoman because she gives them good prices.  Isabel requested this loan so that she could grow her shoe and clothing business.  She will buy items in different colors and sizes so that she will have them on have when her customers request them and not have to order them.

Mary Ann is a high school graduate and is married to Luis, a driver. Together they are raising four children, two of whom are still in school. Their family currently resides in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nOwning a piggery requires a lot of effort and Mary Ann recognizes this. Every day she has to make sure the piglets are given the right nutrition, stay in a good environment, and has the right suitable conditioning. She considers all these factors to make sure the piglets produce well. She also continuously seeks ways to improve the piggery. Mary Ann has been managing this business for 11 years, and makes a net income of around Php11,350 each month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue  the operations of her piggery, Mary Ann is requesting a loan for Php 27,000.  She will use this loan to purchase feeds for her piglets and materials to renovate her piggery. Included in the list of items to buy are hollow blocks, cement, and wood. She says that the profits will be used as additional investment in the future. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Mary Ann faces is when the pigs get sick.  She is also concerned about her children, as lately they have become disobedient when it comes to attending school. But Mary Ann is maximizing every resource she has at hand to make sure she arrives at the results she wanted. She dreams of becoming prosperous and raising her piggery to the next level. Of course, it is also her dream to see her children finish their education and have a career of their own someday, because the bottom line is that she cares and loves her children most. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":778803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He has three children, and his wife works as a teacher at the local school.  Since 1981, Omar's family has been successfully involved in breeding livestock and farming.  Having started with a purchase of one cow, Omar was able to grow the livestock headcount to four cows and five sheep.  He also has 2.5 tons of corn for the next sale.  Profits from this business allowed Omar to buy a car for his family.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Omar requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a dairy cow.  He intends to use the planned profit to build a new barn in order to provide good conditions for keeping

lives with his wife on Parahyangan street, Tuban Bali in a quite decent rented 3 x 3-meter room. Both of his children stay with their grandmother and studies in Jawa. In his daily life, he works as a second-hand goods collector. He collects junks and second-hand goods and then re-sell them. He has done this work since 6 years ago. Although people think that this job is dirty and unhealthy, Nawi keeps working on it. The income from the junks is enough to cover his children's education in Java, rent fee, daily expenses, and recently he just managed to buy a motorcycle. He hopes he can get a loan for his capital to buy sellable second-hand goods.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNawi tinggal bersama istrinya di Jl.Parahyangan Tuban Bali dengan mengontrak sebuah kamar kecil berukuran 3 x 3 meter dan kondisi tempat tinggalnya cukup baik. Kedua orang anaknya tinggal di Jawa bersama neneknya dan bersekolah disana. Sehari-harinya kegiatan Nawi adalah sebagai pemulung, mengumpulkan rongsokan dan barang-barang bekas untuk kemudian dijual lagi. Pekerjaan ini sudah ditekuninya sejak 6 tahun yang lalu. Meskipun orang menganggap pekerjaan ini kotor dan tidak sehat, tapi Nawi tetap tekun menjalaninya. Penghasilan dari mencari barang rongsokan cukup untuk menyekolahkan anaknya di Jawa, membayar biaya kontrak rumah, untuk kebutuhan sehari dan sekarang bahkan Nawi sudah bisa membeli sepeda motor. Harapannya dia bisa diberi pinjaman yang nantinya akan dipakai sebagai modal membeli barang bekas lalu kemudian dijual kembali."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":158689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste Management","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To add more capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-10T14:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nawi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-24T16:25:44Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":230391.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238579},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":230391.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267460},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":230391.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296659},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":230391.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327275},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-31T07:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":230391.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360775}],"funded_date":"2008-05-10T16:25:44Z","paid_date":"2008-10-31T07:14:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":51922,"name":"Nabikhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nabikhan I.,46, has been raising and selling sheep for meat since 1985.

She is 36 years old and has given birth to three sons and two daughters. All of them are getting their education. Her husband has a business selling ready-made garments. He takes orders from different ready-made garment shops and supplies the order by purchasing the clothing from factories. \r\n\r\nNasreen herself is a seamstress, and she works full time. She gets orders from her neighborhood customers and sews beautifully designed clothes to earn a supplementary income for the family. \r\n\r\nNasreen has applied for a loan for her husband who wants to buy a large quantity of ready-made garments to fill larger orders on time. Her husband is of the view that by taking larger orders he can earn more profits because there are better profit margins when dealing with big parties.

Though the income from this business is unstable, she is really wise in using the capital entrusted to her by the Institution. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 60, she is still strong and always inspired in doing her business. On the other hand; her business gives her an income and the same time pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe is dreaming that someday her youngest child Gilner will also finish her studies through college and in that way, she will find a decent job someday because she doesn't want their children and their grandchildren to experience the hardships brought on by poverty.\r\n\r\nPresently she is applying for a loan amounting to Php.8,000 which will be used as additional capital for her variety store business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Tolib is 48 years old and lives in Istaravshan town with his wife works as a shopkeeper to help with the living expenses.Tolib has four sons who also help him. For thirty years Tolib has worked his land which produces potato, tomato and cucumber. His greatest dream is to be able to establish more crops to that he can leave equal parts to his children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Previously the members were 11 people and now two among them stopped because felt already able to manage their venture with their own funding.

To maintain the profit they already attained till now of fluctuating from Rp.600.000 till Rp.800.000 in the time of 6 months, they strategize with ways to find the precise time to sell the pig that is during the religious festival when the price of pork is usually higher than ordinary day.  With this method the group is able to maintain the stability of their venture.  Viewing the current situation where not all members is independently able to operate venture with their own funding thus the group decided to continue to work with Dinari, that is by following the pig rearing program for a period of 6 months with the repayment occurring at the end of the loan period, with the hope that the venture will develop and gradually nurturing the funding from the gain earned until they become self-sufficient at a later time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":292521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy piglets and feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2009-03-30T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Kongsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Desi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Wardani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Arseni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh Suci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Sunia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suwarti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Sukerti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":15600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1350,"local_amount":15600000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-18T09:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15824019.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87026494}],"funded_date":"2009-03-31T08:38:28Z","paid_date":"2009-12-18T09:03:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pheng Tan","image":null}},{"id":101109,"name":"Mao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Mao S., 28, is married to Maly, 23 and they live in the rural area of Banteay Meanchey Province.

B. is 51 years old and lives with her partner, her son and her 7 year old granddaughter.  \r\n<p><p\/>\r\nThe community in which Ms. Carmen lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the Cartago province.  It is a small rural community of approximately two thousand inhabitants.  The residents work in milk production and coffee planting.  The terrain is uneven and much of the land is tropical rainforest.  The community has a very picturesque landscape that combines the tropical forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and dairies.  El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, the city and commercial center.  Unfortunately, several times a year the road becomes impassible due to the heavy rains that batter the region.  This is, without a doubt, one of community\u2019s main challenges.\r\n<p><p>\r\nYears ago, when no viable productive activities existed, many people opted to leave and look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica.  Presently coffee and milk prices have improved so residents are figuring out how to invest in projects in the same area and this way avoid having to move.\r\n<p><p>\r\nMs. Carmen started her business, a small restaurant with Creole food called a \u201csoda\u201d, in her own house.  She says that this way she can help with household expenses and she also feels happy to have her own business because she has been very well received in the community.  Carmen commented that the biggest attraction in her restaurant are the tamales, which are a very typical food in Costa Rica.  \r\n<p><p>\r\nRight now she needs a loan of 500,000 colones (Costa Rican Currency) to purchase more merchandise that she can sell, to increase her business and offer better service to her neighbors and the tourists who pass through the area.  More specifically, she will buy a machine to grind corn, an extra large pot to cook tamales in, a large container to mix the dough in, a plastic basket to sell the product, and the ingredients necessary for its production.\r\n<p><p>\r\nMs. Carmen is a member of the Productores del Sauce de Santa Teresita Association, one of the 100 member groups of the EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan and with it she hopes to grow on a personal and economic level.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Brgy Tagbino Vallahermoso, Negros Occidental with her 49-year-old husband, Gregorio, who works as a farmer and habal-habal driver (a single motorcycle used for transportation especially in a mountainous area).  They have four children who are between 18-29 years old. Two of them work, one is still a student and one has a family.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her buy and sell of rice business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000.\r\n\r\nAbundia is now borrowing PHP 26,000 so that she can expand her buy and sell rice business. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000, which she paid off within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Abundia aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

All this started because Farida\u2019s husband became interested in sand block production and then concluded that this business would be profitable. For two years now, this business has been the main source of family income. From the profits, they have managed to purchase equipment for sand block manufacturing (200000 soms) and also to obtain a flat (100000 soms). They earn on average 28,000 soms per month.\r\n\r\nThe family is planning to purchase a used car. They already have some money, but need some extra funds to achieve their aim. Hence they need a loan.

This is Maria's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":722821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Rosalie was not able to finish her courses in college, but her involvement in CCT* enabled her to build her own small business. She is now married to a driver named Arnel, and together they have four dependents. One is in high school, two are in elementary, and one is not yet studying. Together they live in Libertad, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nRosalie buys and sells accessories for a living. She has a space in the commercial area of their community in Libertad. There she displays her personally chosen accessories, which she hopes are fashionable enough to catch the attention of potential buyers. Rosalie has been selling accessories for fifteen years now, and she does it without the help of an employee. Monthly she and her husband are able to earn about $295.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Rosalie is borrowing an amount of 21,000 PHP to be able to purchase stylish accessories for sale. She acknowledges that the loan will help her in revolving the finances of her business. With this loan, she is able to buy huge quantities of stock and meet her family's daily needs as well.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Rosalie faces is the number of customer debts. Also, sometimes the daily sales are low. Another challenge is that her eldest child is beginning to keep bad company in school. She thus prays that she would have the time to focus on the studies of her children and keep them from bad influences. It is her earnest desire to bring them closer to the Lord. She also would like to have her own commercial space.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":741344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The profit from the farm is used to pay for Biyang Ayu and her daughters' daily living expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nGusti Ayu Biang S. adalah seorang janda, karena suaminya sudah lama meninggal. Di usianya yang sudah tidak muda lagi, untuk mencukupi keperluan hidupnya Biang S. hanya mengandalkan usaha ternak babi. Sebelumnya Biang S. memelihara bibit babi dan dijual untuk babi guling. Semejak bergabung dan mendapat bantuan dana dari Yayasan DINARI, Biang S. mulai mengembangkan dengan memembeli satu ekor induk. Karena kondisi Biang S. sudah cukup lanjut maka pemeliharaan  dibantu keduan anak perempuannya yang tinggal disebelah rumahnya. Pemberian pakan dilakukan dalam sehari hanya 2 kali yaitu pagi dan sore hari.\r\n Dalam 6 bulan Induk babi melahirkan 8 ekor bibit babi. Pengeluaran pemeliharaan untuk pakan dan pengobatan menghabiskan dana Rp. 700.000,-. Total keseluruhan penjualan 8 ekor secara sistem gulingan Rp. 2.000.000,- . Total keuntungan bersih selama 6 bulan mencapai Rp.1.300.000,-. Dengan keuntungan dari usahanya dipakai untuk mencukupi keperluan sehari-hari  dan memberikan upah kepada kedua anaknya perempuannya yang sudah membantu memelihara babinya untuk dapat dipakai mencukupi kebutuhan sehari-harinya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":81953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Breeding Pig","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-11-10T13:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Biyang Ayu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-24T19:58:45Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T02:02:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94389},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T06:40:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:41Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111478},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T07:20:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129055},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T07:30:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154057},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T06:25:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182671},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T03:01:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213667},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:05:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246046},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275661},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305201},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:12Z","rounded_local_amount":274270.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336180},{"amount":50,"local_amount":428571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-24T06:37:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":457118.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368416}],"funded_date":"2007-11-10T19:58:45Z","paid_date":"2008-11-16T08:41:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":27374,"name":"Nina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nina is 27 years old and is the mother of a child aged 10.

Mayocc Village Bank live and meet in the community of Mayocc, in Churcampa Province of Huancavelica Department, in central Peru. The town sits on the left bank of the Mantaro River at about 2,300 meters above sea level. The weather in the area is very warm.<P>\r\n\r\nMost of the community is involved in commerce or fruit production; the fruit is sold mainly in Huanta. There is also some livestock in the area, including a number of guinea pig farms.<P> \r\n\r\nAlberta and Candelaria are two members of the San Miguel D. Mayocc Village Bank. Alberta is married with four children, who are 20, 16, 14 and 10 years old. She raises and sells guinea pigs, a business she has been involved in for the past three years. At first, the business was difficult, since her guinea pigs had fleas, but now the problem is under control, thanks in part to loans from FINCA, which she used to buy medicine. She plans to use her current loan of 200 soles to fix the irrigation system for her alfalfa, which she grows to feed the guinea pigs. Her dreams for the future are for her children to graduate with professional degrees, and to have a large guinea pig farm. <P>\r\n\r\nCandelaria is married with five children, who are 25, 23, 20, 18 and 16 years old. She also has a guinea pig farm; she buys young animals and fattens them up to resell. Like Alberta, Candelaria had problems when she first started raising guinea pigs because they got sick and died and she didn\u2019t know how to keep them healthy. She has learned a lot about the animals since then, and they don\u2019t get sick any mO.. She plans to use her loan of 500 soles to buy supplements for her guinea pigs, so that she can fatten them up and sell them in the city of Ayacucho. Like Alberta, Candelaria\u2019s dreams for the future are for her children to graduate with professional degrees and to have a large guinea pig farm.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":242791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fix irrigation system on farm, buy nutritional supplements for guinea pigs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-21T18:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariluz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tadea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanny Yanett","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmeri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelida Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina Sandy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.34},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.34},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1733.34},{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.34},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.34},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1733.34,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932983},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1733.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215303},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1733.34,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397011},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":1733.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088687},{"amount":562.59,"local_amount":1733.64,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1739.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982046},{"amount":562.41,"local_amount":1733,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1738.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442756}],"funded_date":"2008-12-22T16:14:37Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:51:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":84741,"name":"Ni Wayan Sariani","description":{"languages":["id","en"],"texts":{"id":"Periode ini Ni Wayan Sariani kembali melanjutkan pinjaman dari yayasan DINARI.

They know each other as neighbours and as relatives.\nThey all engage in almost the same type of businesses: firewood sales and food preparation. They are highly sought after in this work.\nIn the framework of improving the quality of their services and enlarging the size of their businesses, the members of the Confiance group decided to work with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with whom they are seeking their fifth solidarity (group) loan. All of their previous loans were repaid properly.\nThey intend to use this loan to create a sizable stock of firewood and to buy bags of beans and cans of cooking oil. The firewood is sold at retail in cash at their homes. As for the beans, they are sold after cooking at night at the crossroads with the oil.\nThey each hope to earn an average profit of 140,000 FCFA during this loan cycle, which will be used to repay the loan and meet the needs of their extended families, with the rest being invested in their businesses.\nTheir ambition is to diversify their business by stocking cereals of all types together and becoming wholesalers of firewood.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":281753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy firewood, cooking oil, and beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mafoun\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aramata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":483.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":251719.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033706},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":125859.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621074},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":125859.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020039},{"amount":241.68,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":125859.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242784},{"amount":241.65,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":125859.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678363}],"funded_date":"2009-04-09T13:43:16Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":97029,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Mary P. is currently in the business of petty trading and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  farming, livestock and a general store. Her husband Abraham, who is 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 23 and 32 years old. Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to fund the farm.  She makes an income from the sales of products from her farm.  She also has an inventory of livestock so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and expansion of her business. Gilda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
