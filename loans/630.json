It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns a minimum of PHP 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMonina dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration there from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She used this money to raise the pigs and chickens. From 1995 to 2000, she continued to use the borrowed money on raising pigs, chickens and fish, earning 800 USD\/ year. In 2001, seeing that local people and those living nearby enjoyed decorative plants, she switched to this activity. She bought the pots, the seeds and planted them. She distributed her plants to the hotels, and retailed. She also did not stop raising animals. Because the business went well, her family economy improved. She has 5 children, 3 of whom are grown-up and living separately, and the other two are still going to school.

Vive en una casa propia con su esposa. A\u00fan no tiene hijos. Su familia se ha dedicado desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la ganader\u00eda tanto para leche como para carne. \u00c9l sigui\u00f3 los mismos pasos y actualmente tiene una finca que es la que le ayuda a salir adelante. \nLa comunidad en la cual vive Danny se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\nHace dos a\u00f1os, se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce. Por lo tanto, en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os Danny ha ido especializ\u00e1ndose en la producci\u00f3n de leche que luego vende a esta planta. \nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Danny es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cQueso Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho comprar el queso Turrialba para comerlo en el desayuno junto con tortillas, arroz, frijoles y huevos. Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para el queso que se har\u00e1 con la leche que venda Danny es muy bueno.\nDanny desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s. Danny dice que sacar\u00e1 este pr\u00e9stamo para mejorar la calidad de vida de su esposa y de \u00e9l en este momento y si con el paso de los a\u00f1os hay hijos que tengan una mejor calidad de vida y tal vez que ellos puedan tener la oportunidad de estudiar que \u00e9l no tuvo.\nActualmente Danny orde\u00f1a a mano en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Si aumenta la producci\u00f3n espera ir haciendo un local mejor y en unos a\u00f1os poder comprar un equipo de orde\u00f1o. Tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda ir mejorando los pastos con variedades m\u00e1s adecuadas para la producci\u00f3n de leche y as\u00ed contar con una finca que le permita producir m\u00e1s.\nDanny es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya 5 microcr\u00e9ditos y los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente. Los montos han ido incrementando desde los US$ 300, US$ 430, US$ 500, US$ 600 y US$ 700. Actualmente  Danny necesita un pr\u00e9stamo por $1.000 para comprar su vaca lechera. \n","en":"Danny Villalobos R. is 31 years old. He lives in his own house with his wife. They do not have children yet. His family has had cattle for many years, for both milk production and meat production. He has followed the same path and now has a farm that helps him to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThe community where Danny lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. It is a small, rural town of two thousand inhabitants. The people of the town work in milk production and coffee farming. The topography is hilly and most of the area is maintained as tropical rainforest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with pretty ponds, coffee plantations, and dairies. El Sauce is located approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest center of commerce. Even so, several times a year the road becomes impassible because of the rains. This is, without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges for the community. When there weren\u2019t many jobs, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Lately the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so now people from the area are looking for ways to invest in projects there. Two years ago a cheese processing plant was started by the Milk Producers Association of El Sauce. Because of this, for the past two years Danny has been specializing in producing milk that he then sells to the cheese factory.\r\n\r\nThe cheese from the region where Danny lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \u201cTurriabla Cheese.\u201d Ticos (a nick-name for the people Costa Rica) like to buy Turrialba cheese to eat it at breakfast, along with tortillas, rice, beans, and eggs. This is why the market for the milk that Danny sells, which is then made into cheese, is very good.\r\n\r\nDanny hopes to obtain a micro-loan to buy another dairy cow so that he can increase the milk production. He knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice and will require more work, but he says that if he wants to help his family get ahead, he\u2019ll have to work hard to produce more. Danny says he will take out this loan to improve the quality of life for his wife and himself right now; if the years pass and there are children, he hopes they will have a better quality of life and maybe they can have the opportunity to study that he didn\u2019t have.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Danny milks by hand in a small wooden shed that he set up as a milking room. If his production increases, he hopes to construct a better building and then, in a few years, be able to buy a milking machine. He would also like to improve his pasture with varieties of grass that are better suited to milk production and in this way have a farm that will allow him to produce more.\r\n\r\nDanny is a client of the Producers Association of El Sauce, a local partner organization of the microfinance organization EDESA. Because of his ties to this organization, he has received 5 micro-loans and he has repaid them satisfactorily. The amounts have increased from US$300.00, to US$430.00, to US$500.00, to US$600.00, and to $700.00. Danny now needs a loan of $1,000.00 to buy his dairy cow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

The sauce made from pork locally called \u00abHan kp\u00e8t\u00e8\u00bb is the sauce most consumed by the people in Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of B\u00e9nin.  And so he got started in making and selling this pork sauce.  It is a business passed down from his father.  Jean\u2019s customers are growing from day to day, but he isn\u2019t able to satisfy them because of the meager financial means he has.  Therefore, he is requesting a loan to bolster his business.  \r\n<p>\r\n<i>Alid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":396888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-29T16:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":71229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868314},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":71229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757510},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":71229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146604},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":71229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984749},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":71229.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015422},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":71229.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740428}],"funded_date":"2009-09-29T17:39:52Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":145110,"name":"Musu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musu K. is a single parent selling provisions and cosmetics.

The father of 2 says he began teaching after he finished his teaching course at university. On the side, Abert also has a modest retail business that he runs. With 3 years in his teaching job, he has solidified his insight on the virtues, ethics and benefits of giving people an education. Notwithstanding the low remuneration that most teachers get, Abert has never been one that wavers in his desire to give people knowledge that will, at length, help them in their lives.

Now, at age 37, she herself is married and mother of three children. This very lucrative business permits her to support her family financially, since her husband, who is a farmer is not able to do so because his income is meager. <P> Very dynamic and conscientious in her position as principle breadwinner for her family, Mrs. A. is always trying to do better by her children. For that reason, she would like to vary her inventory and build a little kiosk to sell out of, so that her little general store can become  better known in her neighborhood. This will permit her to increase her income so that she can better care for her children whom she loves so much. She is very concerned about their future and especially their schooling, because she herself is illiterate and knows that that makes life very difficult indeed. To accomplish these goals, Mrs. A. is asking for a loan of US$ 700. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer <P><\/B>La vente des produits de premi\u00e8res n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s est une activit\u00e9 que Madame A.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

F. is 25 years old and married.  This young entrepreneur has no children.  Her life has been spent working for herself, and her intentions are to support her business.  Previously, she had the experience to own this business but due to the economic situation her business declined; now her intentions are to keep promoting the sale of her clothes. Her goals are to improve herself in life and she recently studied in the last year of her career, for she wants to fight to achieve that goal, as the situation in the country is difficult and she wants to have children who can have a good place to study and live and a solid economic base. Her dreams are to be a great entrepreneur who generates income inside her country and have an economic influence at the national level.  It is one of her dreams that she would like to make the country progress and that students can have the confidence to develop their personal ambition. \r\n\r\nYoung Gema's economic activity is selling used clothes and cosmetics.  She has owned her business for four years, and it is located in her house.  Gema started this activity with the objective of financing her university studies.  With the help of her mother she received a loan from Fundacion Leon in 2000; she achieved the financing to start this business, and has since tried to maintain it, with much effort and sacrifice.  Some times her studies would not allow her to give it complete attention; it was very difficult in the beginning and she did not have many clients or many options to offer them, and moreover she had to overcome the crisis facing her family, and some times she had to leave to sell on the street.  However, when she obtained enough clients, her business became fruitful and this is the reason she decided to ask for financing for working capital, as she has to buy her products by the box, and moreover she has to travel to Managua and Chinandega, for that is where it is most favorable to make her purchases. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cara Gutterman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":267353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Capital to buy clothes and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T06:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gema Daly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":458.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":458.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23.7,"local_amount":474.01,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":474.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092060},{"amount":22.13,"local_amount":442.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":442.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985442},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":458.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":458.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446058},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":458.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":458.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956695},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":3666.68,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3666.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174118}],"funded_date":"2009-02-10T10:01:38Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cara Gutterman","image":null}},{"id":91784,"name":"Osas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Osas O. is a 36-year-old single man.

Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJuliet is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to fund operations of her fishing and fish-vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 7th cycle loan, the amount of PHP 19,500, which she intends to use on her existing fishing and fish-vending business. Juliet is working hard to achieve the dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has successfully repaid her last loan from HSPFI, which was for 17,000 PHP and was used to purchase tools needed to provide service.\r\n\r\nRosenia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to to purchase tools and utilities needed for the maintenance of the service. This loan will be her sixth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":738221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is married to Cleto, a jeepney driver, and the mother to their four children. Three of them are already working while the other one is in high school. By the grace of God, Rosana has managed to support her child's schooling. Rosana is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosana oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have one unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney, which are paying boundary (daily quota) each day. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy new accessories and parts for their jeepney and also to buy some equipment in their repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\nRosana dreams that her child will finish her education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n---Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":895083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

<p>\r\n\r\nGladys is a dedicated woman that works hard every day and devotes all of her energy to offering excellent Chinese food to the diners that visit her small restaurant every day. This venture began seven years ago, selling from a small cart. It was made possible by the help and company of her beloved husband and thanks to a loan from her father-in-law. After three years of success, Gladys and her husband decided to establish their business in a rented shop where they have been for nearly four years. They have continued to put incredible effort into their business and have been able to build their clientele little by little and create more earnings to support their small children. Their goals are big and they dream of opening other restaurants. They have committed to continue working diligently to achieve this goal. However, right now a more urgent matter is that her husband is in poor health and needs an expensive medical procedure. Gladys will continue working and this is why they are asking for a loan of $350 to improve the facilities of their location. Don't miss this valuable opportunity to work with Gladys. Helping her will help her whole family!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":77728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Starting up a small Chinese restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-10-29T09:25:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-12T17:07:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2007-12-12T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108642},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-01-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":114512},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-02-12T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":134089},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-12T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":156488},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180860},{"amount":55,"local_amount":157.14,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-12T09:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":165.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208441}],"funded_date":"2007-10-29T16:07:52Z","paid_date":"2008-05-12T09:10:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":26241,"name":"Christiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Christiana E. is a dealer in pure water and table water.

At the young age of 17, when she was studying 12th grade, she started to teach without any formal training and with her own efforts she has been able to improve, due to the fact that she achieved her title of elementary school teacher and is currently working towards her Licentiate in Education.  Because she was raised in a rural community, in addition to teaching, she also does production activities with the help of her brothers.  With 8 previous loans, she has bought 3 calves and 1 stud, which she brands with her mother's branding iron.  This 9th loan will be used to plant pasture to feed her animals and to plant corn for self consumption.  This loan is urgent because winter is coming up and she needs to have the land ready for sowing. <p> Teacher T. is a loyal client because she started getting loans when the institution opened its doors to the waged-earning sector in 2001, when no banks or micro financing institutions would risk to work with vulnerable sectors.  She feels fulfilled with the attention given to her, that's why she is still with us, she has an excellent sense of morality to pay back and most of the time she repays her loans one or two months in advance.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMilena de 47 a\u00f1os, soltera, no tiene hijos, habita junto a su familia (mam\u00e1 y hermanos), desde muy jovencita a la edad de 17 a\u00f1os inicio el apostolado del magisterio de manera empirica, cuando estudiaba el 3er a\u00f1o de bachillerato, con su propio esfuerzo ha logrado superarse, ya que obtuvo su titulo de maestra de educacion primaria, tecnico medio en contabilidad y actualmente esta estudiando la Licenciatura en Pedagogia.  Como ha sido criada en el campo, ademas de la docencia realiza labores productivas con el apoyo de sus hermanos.  Con los 8 creditos anteriores ha comprado 3 vaquillas y un semental, los que herra con el fierro de su mama, este noveno credito lo utilizara para la siembra de 3 Mzs de zacate mejorado para la alimentacion de sus animales y 3 Mzs de maiz para el autoconsumo, la urgencia de este credito es porque ya se aproxima el invierno y quiere tener el terreno preparado para la siembra. <p>La profesora T. ha sido una cliente fiel, pues inicio con sus creditos cuando la institucion abre las puertas al sector asalariado en el a\u00f1o 2001, cuando ningun bancio ni microfiananciera se arriesgab a a trabajar con los sectores vulnerables.  Ella se siente satisfecha de la atencion que ha sido objeto y es por eso que continua con nosotros, tiene una excelnte moral de pago, casi siempre paga con uno o dos meses de anticipacion sus

Matucana Communal Bank consists of ten people who have been working with EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD for more than 2\u00bd years.  The loans they have received were invested into their businesses.  As a result, the income they generate help pay for their household expenses and improve their quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nTake the example of Sarela M. E..  She tells us that she raises animals (ducks, turkeys, and rabbits) out of her home.  Most of the animals are sold, but some are set asiD. to feed her family.  She also has a llama that serves as the family pet.  Sarela is married and has one child.\r\n<p>\r\nIt all started one day when she brought home a guinea pig for her mother to prepare as a meal, but she did not know at the time she purchased it that it was pregnant.  She eventually found out about it in time and was able to earn an income from the offspring.  Sarela acquired a male guinea pig so that she could continue the momentum of her new business.  She needed additional capital to buy food (grasses and feed for fattening) for the animals, so she applied for a loan so that she could keep her business running.  At one point, she had as many as 150 guinea pigs, which was too much to handle.  Sarela was able to sell all of the animals and use the capital to purchase a motorcycle taxi, from which she continues to receive rental income to this day.  \r\n<p>\r\nSarela and her husband are considering starting another business since he does not have a stable job at the moment.  She continues to be the primary support for covering her family\u2019s expenses.  Sarela is requesting a loan to purchase trousers, jackets, and comforters.  She plans to sell these items to friends and acquaintances for the winter season.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":418251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase winter merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-02T23:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarela Bereniz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Blanca Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Miriam Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":940,"local_amount":2720,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2735.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669094},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1367.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064553},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1367.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899613},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1367.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933699}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T12:58:10Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":153409,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn la ciudad de Managua, este cliente se dedica arduamente a laborar con el fin de llevar el sustento a su hogar compuesto por su esposa y por sus tres peque\u00f1os hijos en edad escolar a los que le debe proporcionar las condiciones necesarias para vivir.\n\nEl se ha preocupado por el bienestar de su familia y para ello ha solicitado un cr\u00e9dito porque requiere mejorar las condiciones de su vivienda porque se ha encontrado muy maltratada y necesita brindarles a sus hijos un techo digno donde vivir.

She is a very strict and hardworking lady. For the last two years, she has been running a general store where she sells products such as soft drinks, bread, sugar, rice and hair extensions. She sells her products to local people, schools and colleges. Her business is located at Khayega in Kakamega, in a busy market along a busy road. In addition to her general store, she also provides computer services. \r\n<br>Carolina works very hard from early morning to late evening to ensure her business' success in a market where there are many other traders engaging in the same kind of business as hers. Her major challenge is lack of funds, and that is why she is requesting a loan to increase her stock in order to grow her business. Carolina is also using her loan to start up a car wash to generate extra income. Her hope is to improve her living standards and build a beautiful house for herself. She also dreams of becoming a wholesaler.

Mr. Ben C. is the village bank president selected by the other members, who all plan to use their loans for different purposes. \r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Ben C. is a farmer who owns 2 hectares of land to cultivate rice to support his family. His wife is a wine and gasoline seller in the local village. He is the father of three children, two of whom are teachers, while the third attends the local public school. Mr. Ben C. is facing some obstacles because his rice field is infertile but he does not have enough money to improve it. Thus, Mr. Ben C. decided to request a loan to buy fertilizer. He would use the rest of the loan to start a new business and buy three piglets for breeding . Mr. Ben C. is busy with his rice field so his wife came instead of him to take out the loan .

product dealership and livestock sales business. She lives in Crossing Baterna, Brgy. Rafaela Barrera, Sagay City, Negros occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1993 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. \r\n\r\nMaria is now borrowing PHP 19,500 to continue funding operations of her cosmetics business. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She says it's definitely a great group.\r\n\r\nThrough the training provided in the meetings, Leonor has learned how to distribute her earnings and expenses in a better way, which has allowed her to keep her business better organized.  Temuco is the capital of the La Araucan\u00eda region.  The city is located 670 kilometers to the south of Santiago (the capital of Chile.)  In the surrounding areas, there are a number of lake resorts (Puc\u00f3n, Villarrica), and very eye-catching flora and fauna concentrated in nearby natural parks. It\u2019s worth pointing out that 50% of the Mapuche, indigenous peoples of our country, live in this region. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":915586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy herbs, condiments and potatoes to stock up her store ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T17:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":401204,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":28744},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30934},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":31524},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":32126},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":32739},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33364},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":31980},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":34611},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":35272},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":35945},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36631},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37334}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119,"local_amount":59678,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":60546.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561337},{"amount":126.92,"local_amount":63650,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":64575.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772332},{"amount":131.81,"local_amount":66103,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":67064.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180779},{"amount":132.78,"local_amount":66591,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":67559.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315215},{"amount":142,"local_amount":71217,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":72252.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031431},{"amount":147.49,"local_amount":73965,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":75040.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643632}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T19:34:58Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":363117,"name":"Waiswa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Waiswa is 35 years old and lives in the town of Bugiri in the Iganga region of Uganda.

She is 64 years old and is retired from her teaching profession but is still very active. She is married to Angelo S., Jr. and they currently operate their own business producing feed out of cassava mixed with some ingredients.  They also make cassava chips, cassava granules and even cassava powder. The couple have 4 children, 2 are already married and 2 are still single and they have 3 grandchildren. They live in Marietta Village, Brgy. Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nHer immediate dream is to be able to buy a new machine that will enable them to produce cassava chips and other cassava-based food products more easily.\r\n\t\r\nIn business one must be a step ahead in terms of strategies and technology. To stay ahead, Letty and her husband needed additional capital, which is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001. With the infusion of new capital, they were able to survive stiff competition and Letty also supplemented their family income by selling appliances on commission basis as a sideline. With the help of the loans, they were able to expand their operations and even expanded their product distribution to other areas, getting regular customers as far as the province of Iloilo.\r\n\r\nPreviously, she borrowed Php 29,000 to use as additional capital for her business and as usual the loan was fully paid in full and on time. This contributed to her maintaining her good credit performance. Now for her 18th cycle loan she intends to borrow the same amount of Php 29,000 for her business of producing feeds and cassava-based products. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture shows Letecia and her husband in their business site with some of their cassava inventory packed in sacks. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":414200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Adela says proudly, \"My husband is well-known and always gets something that is good for my town.  He is also a very responsible father and husband because he never makes us do without anything that we need.\"  She used her savings to buy more farmland so she could grow more food (fruits) that are native to the jungle.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan she has had with MFP, and she is very grateful to the people who make it possible for her to get a loan.  She can have a better life because of them and also because of the support of her communal bank.  With the money she is asking for now, she will buy coffee plants and banana plants.

","en":"As its name suggests, Femmes Commer\u00e7antes is a network of businesswomen. It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, its current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fatou Kin\u00e9 D. is the president of \"Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 17\". She is 43 years old and the mother of four children. She chose to interrupt her studies early on to embark upon commercial ventures. Currently she retails shoes, clothing fabric, handbags, buckets, and gets her supplies as far away as Gambia. She shares this sub-group with its treasurer Mrs. Nd\u00e8ye Coumba S., who retails vegetables at the central market in Thies, Mrs. Khady L. and Mrs. Nd\u00e8ye Ngon\u00e9 D.  who both sell ice cream at the bus station, and Mrs. Fagui D. who is a seamstress.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":518886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Resupply merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-06T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou Kin\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nd\u00e8ye Ngon\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fagui","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nd\u00e8ye Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759346},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790865},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971298},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708574},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922618},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189126},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484554},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63448.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620799}],"funded_date":"2010-04-07T18:11:51Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":195092,"name":"Harriet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nagujja Harriet runs a nine-year-old retail business in Kayunga.

She lives in the parish of Ricaurte. The parish is known for its church but even better known for its culinary expertise, with a great number of local specialties such as oven-roasted pork and barbecued guinea-pig. \r\n\r\nSonia is a seamstress. She studied her trade in a vocational college and has had her own workshop for the past 6 years now. She works from home, sewing women's and children's clothes. Working from home means she doesn't have fixed hours. Sonia is 33 years old, and married with 2 children aged 13 and 3. Her elder son is in high school and her husband is a carpenter.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He makes a living renting washing machines. His main customers are housewives who no longer want to manually wash items under the hot sun in Caribbean Colombia. He decided to start this business 10 years ago when as a product of his job as a guard he decided to buy eight washing machines with cash, and since then he strives daily to satisfy his market. His goal for the future is to acquire a motorcycle so he has better transportation from where his business is located to where each customer needs him to be. Habit is applying for his first loan with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because he wants his business to continue to grow. With the loan, he plans to add three more washers to his inventory, which will help him generate more revenue, since he has lost customers because the machines he has are loaned out to other clients and his growing customer base requires more attention so he can keep perfecting his craft. While he works hard to improve, his business handles a return on sales of no less than 40 percent and an autonomous consumption rate of 91 percent.

She does this job together with her husband, working as a team. In the beginning, she worked as a reseller, purchasing lots of alfalfa and reselling them in the local market. Thanks to her enthusiasm and the advice of some friends, she was able to obtain an alfalfa field so that she could grow her own product.

Even so, Lourdes continues to work, as she has other goals that she wishes to attain for the good of her family. She would like to produce more alfalfa in order to increase sales.

Her wish is to help herself and to be able to enjoy her old age, given that her children live far from her and have their own families. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":289699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To acquire more sheep, fatten them, and sell them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T08:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":278.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590728},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984991}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T09:51:56Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":100024,"name":"Djiguis\u00e8m\u00e8 (\"hope\") Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe  Djiguis\u00e8m\u00e8  de l\u2019association Dembagnouman est compos\u00e9 de six femmes.

P. es un se\u00f1or de 57 a\u00f1os de edad. Vive con su esposa y un ahijado  en una comunidad llamada, El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDesde hace varios meses que Don Mario  se dedica a la cr\u00eda de pollos para engorde y gallinas ponedoras para la producci\u00f3n de carne y huevos, el vende sus productos a los vecinos de su comunidad los cuales se muestran muy satisfechos. El dice que tener el apoyo y la ayuda de su esposa le facilita seguir con el proyecto. Adem\u00e1s dice que el proyecto le es muy interesante   ya que ha visto como poco a poco su negocio crece y la demanda cada vez es m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\nActualmente don Mario est\u00e1 solicitando un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para la compra de m\u00e1s pollos y gallinas; concentrado, y productos para el tratamiento de enfermedades; adem\u00e1s de ampliar y reforzar su local.

He lives with his wife and godson in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the province of Cartago.  It is a small, rural community with approximately two thousand residents.  Its inhabitants work in milk production and planting coffee. It has an irregular landscape and much of the land is kept as a tropical rain forest. The community has picturesque landscapes that combine the rain forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and creameries. El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus to Turrialba, the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, a few times a year the route becomes impassable because of the rains that hit the zone. This is without doubt one of the main challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there weren't any activities many people chose to leave and look for work in Turrialba in the banana farms located in the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Currently the price of milk and coffee have improved, therefore the residents are looking for how to invest in local projects and avoid migrating.\r\n\r\nFor the past few months don Mario has worked on fattening up chickens and laying hens for the production of meat and eggs.  He sells his products to the community residents who are very satisfied.  He says that having the support and the help of his wife helps him continue with the project.  Even more he says that the project interests him since he has seen his business grow bit by bit and demand is getting stronger. \r\n\r\nCurrently don Mario is asking for a micro-credit of \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy more chickens and hens, concentrate, and products for treating sicknesses, in addition to expanding and reinforcing his premises. With this he hopes to grow his business even more and improve his quality of life.  He business is going well, but he hasn't been able to grow because of underfunding.  With the loan that he is asking for he hopes to increase sales and thereby improve the economic condition of his family.\r\n\r\nDon Mario is a member of the Sauce Production Association, one of 100 organizational members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his fifth loan and with him EDESA hopes to continue to grow on a personal and economic level, along with actively participating in the credit organization in its community. \r\n\r\n<br

She lives in the city of Lamas, in Lamas province, Department of San Mart\u00edn.  She is 35 years old and lives with her common-law husband and her son, who is in school.\r\n \r\nFor many years now Rossana has made a living through farming.  She tells us that she started out by planting banana trees on her own farm.\r\n \r\nRossana personally takes charge of caring for her banana trees, but she hires agricultural workers to help her plant and harvest the bananas.  She started out with 300.00 soles and gradually saved her money.  Currently her farm has more than two hundred banana trees; bananas are a product that families here in the rainforest consume daily.\r\n \r\nShe will use this loan of 3,000.00 soles to purchase more banana trees, along with a special fertilizer that will improve the bananas' growth.  She will also invest part of the money in paying the agricultural workers who help her to harvest the bananas, since every month they pick from 80 to 100 bunches of bananas.\r\n\r\nOne of Rossana's dreams and aspirations is to set up a large grocery store so that she can generate more income and continue contributing to the household income.\r\n\r\nRossana now feels that she is a very accomplished woman who wants to achieve and make her dreams a reality.  She is grateful for the help that the Manuela Ramos organization gave her in starting her business, along with the many other women who want to grow their businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":338330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing banana trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-06-22T13:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985539},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205959},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635211},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074276},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989652},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834639}],"funded_date":"2009-06-22T14:54:13Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":120504,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa es socia del Banco Comunal Paloma.\nRosa es casada, tiene 60 a\u00f1os y 5 hijos, Rosa tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general, verduras, frutas, bebidas, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda eventual de sus hijos.\nRosa necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 2000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar y bebidas.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Rosa son ampliar su local, aumentar su negocio e hijos sean profesionales.\n","en":"Rosa is a member of the Paloma Community Bank.

To make a living, Alma owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.

Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Alma from PMPC.

With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Zyndel Marie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for the store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business.\r\n\r\n Zyndel Marie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
