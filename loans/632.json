These loans will be paid back in four months.\n\nThe women of Santa Cecilia dedicate themselves to a variety of different businesses, including selling cooked food from their homes in the evenings, selling beauty products, sewing, making beaded sandals, and running small grocery shops.

She is 42 years old. Annie is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Annie owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle or habal-habal services with her husband as the driver to local community members. Anne is buying and selling used colthing and has been engaged in this business for over 1 year. She earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Annie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. \r\n\r\nAnnie is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools needed for the maintenance of the motorcycle service. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Annie from HSPFI.

successfully paying back her first loan on time, Carmen R. would like to step up to the next level and apply for a second loan. The story of this widowed mother is a testament to the power of microcredit, and Mifex thanks her for her continued efforts. Not only has she built economic value for her family but Carmen has given a sense of pride and motivation to them as well. As the head of the household, Ms. R. constantly works to feed her children and continue running the business. With the increased profits she realized from her first loan, she was able to buy a rotisserie oven for chicken, allowing her to manage the time better. In the morning Carmen purchases and prepares the food, and in the afternoon she can focus on selling it in her newly refurbished market and even doing deliveries. Carmen also makes tasty food called \u201cchifles,\u201d which are fried plantains. She makes these especially for the high school and college students who love to eat at her restaurant\/market. <p>\r\n\r\nCarmen has been able hire a few hired hands to sell her products, helping to distribute the \u201cchifles\u201d to people around the busy market areas. Ms. R. lives in a marginalized sector of Guayaquil, Ecuador with her three children. Her goal over the past six months has been to attract new clients to her store, and Mifex has seen firsthand the change even in that period of time. With more than 13 years experience in this particular line of business, Carmen is a veteran, and her continued involvement in the Kiva microcredit program has brought more growth than ever before. She hopes continued access to credit will help to pay for food, clothing, medicine, and education for her family. Her second loan will go toward buying display cases and other marketing materials to promote the products which have gained somewhat of brand loyalty of her side of town.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a lending microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 44; a widow; and the mother of 6 children who are 29, 27, 21, 17, 15, and 5.  Three of her children are in school.  She only studied through the 4th grade of the old educational system and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her children and also supports her mother by sending her food.  She never moved from her city.  She married her husband when she was 17 and started her business 3 years ago as a way of increasing her family's income.  She makes a trip every week to South Africa or Swaziland, where she buys her products.  She has a sales volume of 20,500 meticais and sells potatoes, white wine, and onions.  She earns around 10,000 meticais per month and applies it to her home's expenses and saves some through a traditional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has had loans with other credit institutions but decided to switch for various reason.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a neighbor.

Es as\u00ed que ambos salen adelante por el bienestar de sus hijos, a quienes desean que ellos fuesen unos profesionales. Ella trabaja muy duro pues debe lidiar con los contratos de las distribuidora que le proporcionan las bebidas, adem\u00e1s los fines de semana es mucho mayor las ventas, ya que se presentan eventos deportivos y fiestas, por lo que tiene mayor demanda sus productos.

She is a hard working woman. She lives with Emilse, who is a 42 year old mechanic, and their children Johana, 8, Susan, 7, and Diego, 2. They all live together in their own home. She has been selling beer for a year. This business has been profitable since she sells by filling orders. She is very well known in the area where she lives. It is difficult to access the market there and because of this, she has very good sales. Deyci is happy because she also generates extra income, and in this way helps her husband who works as a mechanic. In this way they both get ahead for the wellbeing of their children, who they hope will become professionals.  She works very hard; she must deal with the contracts of the distributor who supplies the beverages. On weekends, the sales are much higher since there are sporting events and parties and her products are in higher demand. This is her seventh loan with MFP and she has always shown herself to be very responsible with all of her payments. With the loan she is asking for, she will invest in the purchase of a greater quantity of cases of beer, as well as help her husband to buy some materials for his mechanic's workshop.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":527260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cases of beer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deicy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":164.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168.6},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":179},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":184.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":191.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":205.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":211.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":221.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":232.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":240.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.98},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.46,"local_amount":164.03,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":168.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751958},{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":168.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":173.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934415},{"amount":64.89,"local_amount":179,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":183.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673183},{"amount":66.98,"local_amount":184.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":189.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887011},{"amount":69.37,"local_amount":191.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":196.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154024},{"amount":74.56,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":211.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449308},{"amount":76.79,"local_amount":211.84,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":217.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588039},{"amount":80.37,"local_amount":221.71,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":227.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724670},{"amount":171.46,"local_amount":472.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":486.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462884}],"funded_date":"2010-04-26T19:37:53Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":198537,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is single and she is a tailor.

Her name is Marleny, and she is 35 years old and married with four children (11, 5, 3, and 1 1\/2 years old).\r\n\r\nMarleny is a professional artisan who inherited her skills from her ancestors.  She is originally from the town of Chinchero.  From the time she was very young, she was involved with artisanal crafts without knowing that they were an art form; she made them part of her daily life.  She learned to spin and to tint the various wools with natural dyes from the higher areas of the Andes.  With great facility she learned to knit by hand using rustic knitting implements.  She wove using wool to create different designs.  Generally, the patterns are symbolic representations of Andean daily life: the landscapes, the animals, planting and harvesting, the sun and the water.\r\n\r\nMarleny grew up surrounded by all these things and with her father Forferio painting scenes of nature all the while.  The paintings were discovered and helped to establish a history of a town full of beautiful landscapes and that for centuries has preserved the purity of the Inca legacy through its customs and particularly its art.\r\n\r\nMarleny has been featured in international documentaries and continues to contribute fine artwork to her town and to the world.  Today she exports pieces to the United States.  She dreams of installing accomodations for the various tourists who come from all over the world to stay a few days in order to participate in local customs.  She wants to have more contact with these visitors and wants to teach them to knit.  \r\n\r\nMarleny is requesting this loan to buy more materials so that she can continue creating artwork to ship to her U.S. suppliers.  She is happy to be provided this opportunity and promises to comply with timely repayments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":728909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy more materials in order to create artwork to ship to U.S. suppliers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chinchero - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":453.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":471.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":489.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":529.49},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":547.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.74},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.15},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.17,"local_amount":453.19,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":459.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206102455},{"amount":172.76,"local_amount":471.16,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":478.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211172612},{"amount":179.61,"local_amount":489.85,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":497.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216455189},{"amount":380.89,"local_amount":1038.78,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1054.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221618839},{"amount":200.57,"local_amount":547.02,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":555.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226987840}],"funded_date":"2011-03-12T01:44:18Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:30:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kara Gibson","image":1815905}},{"id":284587,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther L. is from the village of Villa Verde, Iligan City.

They live in the highly populated centre of Canayre in the district of Llochegua. As well as being a mother with daily chores to perform, Lidia also works on her farm. She and her beloved husband have grown cocoa and corn for more than twelve years. The cocoa crop brings in the most money, while the corn brings in less as it is a seasonal crop and can only be planted in January and February and sold in June and July.

He lives in the municipality of Chimor\u00e9, province of Carrasco, in the city of Cochabamba. He lives together with Mar\u00eda Magdalena and their children. He works as a mason, and he also helps his wife Mar\u00eda in her sales stand at a kindergarten. Unfortunately, like many men, Hugo fell into the vice of drinking, and he was neglecting his affairs and even putting his family aside. But time and the responsibility for maintaining his family led Hugo to come to his senses and concern himself more with the well-being of his loved ones. Thus he began working alone, without friends, and he built up a good reputation with his wife's acquaintances, who needed him often for their projects. Over time he advanced to managing construction teams, which was his best distraction, and thus he forgot little by little the problem that lede him to neglect his own situation and that of his family. Now he has a good reputation in his work, and he obtains contracts that give him a better income and let him provide better living conditions for his family. Now he is requesting a loan which he will use to pay for a bladder operation for his wife, since she is a bit overweight and she has been having trouble with her bladder for some time, but the lack of money prevented her from getting medical checkups. She contributes greatly to the family, since with the sales stand at the kindergarten she covers a lot of expenses, and this is also where she finds the contacts for Hugo's work contracts. Mar\u00eda realizes that this was negligence on her part, but now she and her husband are requesting a loan to improve her health; she will undergo an operation that is not very complicated, and then she will be able to continue operating her sales stand and maintaining her family without hindrances to her daily activities. For Hugo, health comes first, and without having health insurance, he decided to pay for his wife's operation and pay off the loan in installments as quickly as possible. \n\nHugo's desire is that his children will have a future that is better than the path he had to travel. He wants to help them finish an advanced high school degree, and his next goal will be to set them on their path with higher education. He will work very hard and do everything possible to make this a reality, so he can see his children in the future with lives that are full and improved.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1004116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to pay for his wife's bladder operation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":291.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":510229,"name":"Emako Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is pictured on the right with her hand raised amongst her Emako Group members.

With this new loan they are planning on buying 20 pieces of \"pagne-wax\" (a West African term for highly decorative and colourful fabric), 15 sets of embroidered \"pagnes\", two rolls of netting, ten bedcovers and 200kg of fresh fish which will be transformed into smoked fish. Sometimes, during the lean season (in between harvests), they stock up on smoked fish in Mopti.\r\n\r\nThey get their supplies at the large market in Burkina Faso and at the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market. They sell on a retail basis, for cash and on credit, to a customer base made up of men and women, at home, walking around and at the markets in M\u00e9dina and Ch\u00e2teau. They expect to make an average monthly profit of 50,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan, as well as for savings and for the purchase of basic foods. \r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":499524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaniba             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T08:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":101048.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021725},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101048.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746525},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":101048.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779066},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":101048.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961269},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":101048.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699399},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101048.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913320}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T21:56:53Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":186262,"name":"Maria Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria Jos\u00e9 tiene mucho tiempo de trabajar con nosotros, ya que se encuentra en una fecha de bastantes pedidos.

Having the necessary number of women ready to move ahead, they decided to participate in the \"Women Entrepreneurs' Committee\" program. They are 17 (seventeen) humble and very hard-working women. \r\n\r\nThe group met with great enthusiasm with the aim of forming a communal bank, where the responsibility is shared and the work is teamwork. They all have independent businesses, such as selling clothes, selling shoes, selling food, operating a neighborhood store, selling fruits and vegetables, etc. \r\n\r\nAda Noelia's work is selling perfumes and colognes. She has a good clientele, thanks to her good service and the variety of her products in terms of price and quality as well as fragrance.\r\n \r\nShe would like to increase her income by buying her merchandise wholesale and thus reducing the price she pays for it. Taking into account the arrival of the new [Southern Hemisphere] spring season, she will acquire a greater variety of fragrances suitable for the season. She is requesting the loan to carry out this plan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She sells her goods mainly on credit to her loyal customers through hawking - that is, she uses a personal selling method; this, she said, makes her goods move very fast. She also sells fried yam with hot pepper to supplement her clothing and materials business.\r\n\r\nJuliana is 35 years old and is a married mother with four children. All her children are in school.

She lives with Andr\u00e9s, age 60, and they have six minor children.  She is raising the children in her own house, which is in the indigenous community of Pumpuriani.\r\n\r\nSince she was a girl she has been working in the noble agricultural trade.  Being able to feed the population is very dependent upon her work and the productivity of the land.  Twenty years ago, thanks to her effort and her savings, she was able to get land for crops.  She started growing coffee, bananas, and avocados.  After giving them the necessary care she sold them to her customers that visit her.\r\n\r\nHowever, the avocado crop gives Bertha the greatest income.  She is the only one in her area that grows this crop.  She sells them in great quantities to merchants throughout the country.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the best is burning her fields after the harvest. (This removes the old growth to make way for new plantings.)  That way there will be new harvests.

runs four little vending facilities where she sells a variety of spices and seasonings at the central food market in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk. Nadiya has been in business for 10 years. She has about $4,000 in inventory and presently her net profit amounts to around $1,000-$1,200 per month.    \r\n<p>\r\nNadiya is very friendly and cheery. Because of her cheerfulness and good service her total number of customers is consistently growing. Reasonable prices, hard-work and tenacity have helped her enterprise reach sustainability and success. The twenty loans she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d are another reason why her business has been so successful. While working with our organization, Nadiya was able to purchase her fourth vending facility and increase her sales volume. \r\n<p>\r\nNadiya has requested a loan for $600 to purchase 10 kilograms of dried mushrooms and a variety of different spices and seasonings that she will sell in her kiosks.  This loan will help her re-supply her inventory and encourage more customers to come and buy from her. Increased sales will generate the necessary funds to sustain her business as well as to meet her family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412 \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0457 \u2013

Houenafa is married to Felix Zoungni, the head of the Zogbo district in Cotonou. She is the mother of six children of whom two are deceased and only two are currently enrolled in school. Three years ago Houenafa began selling food. She sold fried rice to private school children not far from the Zogbo district. To this business she added the sale of donuts made of wheat flour.

Her son helps her with the business. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of her animals she keeps.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 65 years old. Ching is married. To make a living, Ching owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as candies, soy sauce, shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Ching has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ching joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ching has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Ching is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Ching from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is 29 years old. Philipp is single. To make a living, Philipp owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating motor transport services. Philipp is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Philipp joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Philipp is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Philipp from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She has, therefore, set aside space in her house for a workshop that she\u2019s equipped with tools like: sawhorses and embroidery frames.  Her work period is usually in the morning and she spends the afternoon taking care of her daughter.  She enjoys her work because she considers herself a very creative person for she applies novel designs and colors so that her embroidery will be attractive to her customers.  Besides, being done by hand adds value to her work and it\u2019s thus better paid.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan request at MFP; a girl friend invited her and encouraged her to become part of a communal bank.

She has been in a domestic partnership for the last 7 years with Raydo, who is currently living in the city of Lima because of his job. Marcelina and Leidy (her daughter) live in the house that Marcelina owns in the district of San Luis de Shuaro, Chanchamayo. Despite her young age, Marcelina works in agriculture, which she learned from her parents. She has 3 blocks of crop fields on which she cultivates coffee and bananas. \"Coffee is lucrative, but it is harvested only once a year. Banana trees, on the other hand, produce every 15 days, and on those days I make 300 to 400 PEN,\" she states. The most frequent problem she faces is the lack of capital to fertilize her crops. She fertilizes her fields every 4 months, investing no less than 700 PEN, which is something that she has managed to bear. Raydo, her partner, does not neglect his family since he travels to Chanchamayo at the end of each month with the money that he makes at an auto shop. In the future, Marcelina will open a small general store in her community in which she will sell basic need items. Thus, she will be able to have the money she needs to give her daughter a quality of life that neither she nor her partner ever had.  This will be her fifth loan from MFP, which is why she is committed to being punctual in making her monthly repayments. Additionally, she demonstrates joy working with her communal bank because of the incentives and the business opportunities that it gives her. The planting and harvesting season during the months of December and January seem promising, so Marcelina will invest the loan in purchasing bags of fertilizer.
