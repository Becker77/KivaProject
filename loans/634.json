She began selling porridge after her mother convinced her that she needed to earn extra income to help with the household expenses.  Over the past year, she has increased her business and now sells other foods.\r\n<p>\r\nThrough her work, she has been able to assist her husband with the family expenses and her children\u2019s school expenses.

With your help Leticia will be able to support her two children without needing a man in the family.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><P>\r\n\r\n\r\nEn 1999 despu\u00e9s de haber vivido en uni\u00f3n libre con su pareja y procreado a dos peque\u00f1os, su pareja la abandon\u00f3 sin brindarle alg\u00fan apoyo para la manutenci\u00f3n se sus hijos.

R. is from the village of Libertad, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 31 years-old and married with four school-aged children. Jurynda owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Jurynda has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Jurynda joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jurynda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell. Jurynda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jurynda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":436200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Dioselina and consists of 14 members (3 men and 11 women) who are mutually supportive of one another.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. F\u00e1tima is married and has three school-age children.  The oldest is in high school, while the other two are in elementary school.  Sra. F\u00e1tima manages a small neighborhood grocery store located inside of her home.  She sells products such as oil, sodas, and canned goods and hopes to expand her business by adding more products.  For this reason she is requesting a loan.  In the future, she hopes to enlarge her house and make a few repairs.  She also wants to provide her children with a good future by paying for a good education and having a comfortable home where they can develop in all of their activities.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other members of this Communal Bank have businesses involving cosmetics, food, groceries, fine jewelry, beauty salons, motorcycle taxis, and housekeeping services.  Competition is high in the commercial sector, but the members know what it takes to succeed in their businesses by turning over their merchandise or establishing their businesses at the regional markets or neighborhood fairs where they can obtain the most loyal customers who are in need of their products.  This loan will be used to expand their businesses by purchasing merchandise, equipment, and supplies.  They will also provide more comfortable conditions for their customers.  Most of the members are new to the group, but they have plenty of experience working with solidarity group loans at other institutions.  They are satisfied with the objectives they have to achieve with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital and so far have demonstrated teamwork in each of their previous meetings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband is a truck driver who is not able to come home when he travels far distances until he returns to the city with his load, so sometimes she had to wait for his return in order to get funds.

The very tight economy makes supporting her growing family difficult, especially because she must pay for her children's schooling.

After receiving her first loan, Ketut Santi was able to purchase 1 sow and one piglet for fattening.  The sow has since given birth to 10 piglets.  By selling the piglets and the fattened pig, Ketut Santi made a profit of 1,500,000 Rupiah in 6 months.

All of this has allowed her to improve her self-esteem, as she has gone from being a homemaker to a business owner. \r\n\r\nLaura is currently requesting a loan of $1,200.00 to buy a special sewing machine (Kober brand). This sewing machine will allow her to make hems in blouses, t-shirts, and other clothing items. With this investment, she hopes to increase her production and improve the quality of her products. Laura says that thanks to this loan, she will be able to offer better options to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

Mais depuis un certain temps, gr\u00e2ce au premier pr\u00eat que Kiva nous a accord\u00e9, nous arrivons \u00e0 faire face difficilement \u00e0 la demande; \nCe qui nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 augmenter la capacit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande en augmentant le nombre de v\u00e9los disponible \u00e0 la locatiuon et aussi \u00e0 la vente, puisque la demande d'achat est beaucoup plus importante; Avec le premier pr\u00eat, nous sommes pervenus \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les frais scolaires de nos enfants et souhaitons pouvoir agrandir notre commerce. C'est pour cela que nous sommes cvenus solliciter un renouvellement de financement puisque nous avons fini de rembourser le premier pr\u00eat. ","en":"http:\/\/sem-fund.org\/oussouye.php\r\n<p>\r\nWe\u2019ve had a loan that enabled us to get started in commerce and the renting out of bicycles in our eco-village.  Demand is stronger and stronger, and we live in an area where traveling on bikes is easier, due to paths that lead towards surrounding villages.  With the first loan, we began marketing and renting mountain bikes to tourists, who prefer this mode of travel for exploring the most remote corners of our area that they couldn\u2019t usually reach with a car.  \r\n<p>\r\nBut for a time now, thanks to the first loan that Kiva granted us, we are managing with difficulty to cope with the demand, which is leading us to augment our capacity to meet the demand through increasing the number of bikes available for renting and also for selling, since the demand for buying is much greater.  With the first loan, we managed to resolve the problem of our children\u2019s schooling costs.  And we wish to expand our commerce.  This is why we have come to request a renewal of our financing, since we\u2019ve finished paying back the first loan.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

(far left) has created a living selling shampoo, makeup, and other Avon beauty products from her home near Saman\u00e1, Dominican Republic. Living with her husband and three children, ages 13, 11 and 8, Yessenia travels to Santo Domingo to buy the products which she sells. Currently on her eighth loan cycle, Yessenia has faithfully repaid loans for more than three years. With the support of her husband, she has seen her fledgling business grow since she received her first loan with Esperanza.\r\n\r\nYessenia, previous to her loans with Esperanza, was selling clothing to those in her local area. However, finding it difficult to sell these for a good profit margin, and due to slow sales in general, she sought to change her business with her new loan. She then changed to buying her own Avon products \u2013 the shampoo, makeup, rings, etc. \u2013 and selling them locally. This way, she gets to be flexible with the products she delivers to her customers, and is able to make a better profit margin when she buys the products directly from Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nWith these extra profits, Yessenia has been able to improve the quality of living for herself, her husband and her children. She can buy extra food and has been able to pay for unexpected medical bills. Without this financial security, sudden medical bills many times can be extremely hard to overcome, and Yessenia has been able to pay them when needed.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Yessenia first is seeking to grow her business, and to incluD. different products for sale, such as incorporating some of the clothing sales she maD. in the past and adding in more beauty products than she currently offers. With this income, she hopes to continue to proviD. for her family and support her children as they get older.\r\n\r\nThank you for this Kiva

He has 8 siblings who also help with the household expenses even though they are young.\r\n<p>\r\nDany grows bananas and coffee on his own property, which his mother gave him as part of the land that was divided among all of the siblings.  His parents have helped him since he was a young boy, but then they told him that he needed to grow up.  They began helping him when Dany was 11 years old and he approached them for their assistance.  He really enjoyed farming and also realized the profits were good and that his parents provided him with good advice.  Today, Dany knows that the more time he devotes to his farm, the better his production improves and the greater profits he is able to achieve.\r\n<p>\r\nThis young farmer has many goals he wants to complete: growing larger quantities of crops and taking classes in the city for two trades (agriculture and administration, since wants to be able to do both).  He hopes that this part of the Peruvian jungle will emerge as one of the top producers of both fruit and coffee.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.

As a man who does not like to look too much on the wife for all the family needs, and finding it so difficult to accomplished this task as man who should be the breadwinner of the family, he joined GHAPE in 1998.\n\nFru has been having a lot of marital problems with his family. This has made him sad all the time but he is appreciative of the fact that he is alive. His desire is to give his children love and education. He states that he feels better each time he provides something small for his children.\n\nFru\u2019s inability to get investment capital, which could constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs, is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE. Given the loan, he plans to sell motor spare parts. He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site and he has a good sales boy who has sold for him for several years.\n\nFru plans to use the profits generated to sponsor his children in school and to cater for the basic needs of his family.\n\n The first installment will be paid on the fourth month from date of disbursement.\n\n\nAbout GHAPE\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO (non-governmental organization) based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

A. is part of the village bank \u201cKusikuy\u201d which is Quechua (native language) for \u201cHappiness.\u201d\r\nMar\u00eda, who is a proud mother of seven children, has been in the industry of \u201cganader\u00eda,\u201d or stockbreeding, for more than 20 years. Her daily business consists of traveling great distances to the countryside where she buys young bulls and cows. These she takes to her corral outside the city where they stay for several months as she fattens them up to eventually be sold to her clients. She began when her best friend, who is also a stockbreeder, invited her to be a business partner. Together, they began with small products such as eggs and wool, and eventually branched out into the profitable business of stockbreeding.\r\n\r\n<p>This 27-year-old, who lights up the room with her friendly conversation and energetic character, has another business in artesan\u00edas. She and another friend meet on a regular basis to weave beautiful blankets, which she then sells to her many clients. Most of her work is on a contract basis and the majority of her clients are foreigners who wish to return to their country with a colorful souvenir. Mar\u00eda says her goal has always been to save up enough money from both of her businesses and open a small artesan\u00eda shop around the corner from her home.

Additionally he was able to enjoy the comforts of owning his house and a truck that he now uses to deliver his products. <p>\r\n\r\nRicardo proudly mentions that he is doing well in his business and that he can count on the constant support of his family.

Their clientele is composed essentially of women and people who are keen on these traditional Malian handicrafts. <P>\r\n\r\nWith their earnings, they expect to make payments on the loan and help support their families. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":217526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying raw materials (leather, palm fronds, calabashes etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T19:38:49Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974046},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889419},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440212},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135580},{"amount":262.49,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033381},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620783}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T18:38:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":75377,"name":"Miriam Danixa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Miriam tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, pertenece al Banco Comunal Luis Alberto S\u00e1nchez II y vive en la calle Sep\u00falveda 300, distrito de Moche, provincia de Trujillo, departamento de La Libertad, Per\u00fa.\nEstudi\u00f3 primaria completa, pero por su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica no continu\u00f3 estudiando.

She has two children who live at home. Haydee's parents have always been farmers, raising potatoes, peas, and other crops. In the early years of her marriage Haydee continued raising these crops, but she doesn't particularly enjoy farming.\r\n\r\nWhen her daughter was born five years ago, Haydee convinced her husband to open a bodega. He did, agreeing to take charge of the crops while Haydee cares for the children and tends to the store. Since that time, Haydee has spent all of her time and effort on the store, which has grown a client base over the years. This motivates Haydee to continue investing and working on it.

Six years ago he decided to start up his own business because he was about to lose his job. For this reason he bought a photocopier to provide this service to his neighbors. Later he had the opportunity to take his business to a school, so he bough another photocopier and set up a small kiosk offering snacks and refreshments. \u00c1ngel is very pleased with his achievements, but even so he took another job as a security guard, which he does every morning. His wife then tends to the kiosk and copier at the school in the mornings, and \u00c1ngel does it in the afternoons, leaving his eldest child in charge of the copy machine he has at their home. In this way everyone does his or her part to help the family make headway because they know together, with a lot of hard work and dedication, they will achieve their goals. This is the sixth loan for \u00c1ngel with Kiva partner MFP, and during his previous loans he has always shown himself to be very responsible with his payments. With the money he is requesting, he plans to purchase paper and office supplies so he can start selling those items in both his home and at the school, and thus increase his profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":378085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase paper and office supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":317.34},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":332.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":351.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":366.95},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":380.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":398.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":421.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":431.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.78,"local_amount":317.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":318.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081248},{"amount":110.7,"local_amount":332.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":333.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997398},{"amount":117.05,"local_amount":351.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":352.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842743},{"amount":455.85,"local_amount":1367.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734324},{"amount":131.56,"local_amount":394.68,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":396.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992388},{"amount":79.06,"local_amount":237.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":238.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717227}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T04:12:49Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":136866,"name":"Dina","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Z.

He lives with his wife and their four children; two of them are in primary school and the other two in secondary school. For 10 years he has been the owner of a farm where he also lives. There he plants sugar cane and a variety of local staple foods; he also raises cattle. For these activities, he counts on the help of his children and his wife. Once the sugar cane is harvested, he sends it to other cities to be sold, and he also sells it in the local market.\r\n<p>\r\nHis favorite part of his work is giving all of himself and feeling useful to others. Since he relies on steady customers, he obtains very good profits. This is his third loan from MFP. What he likes about working and being part of a community bank is that all his fellow members understand each other and are punctual in their payments. The money that he is asking for now will be wholly invested in increasing the production of his farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":447731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"increase agricultural production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-14T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narciso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672729}],"funded_date":"2009-12-14T20:13:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":165773,"name":"Tsevel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsevel L. is 66 years old and lives with her husband and 19-year-old daughter in Zuunmod town in Tuv province, Mongolia.

She is 48 years old. Emily is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Emely B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nEmily is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Emily owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Emily has been engaged in her business for over twenty-five years and earns approximately $153 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Emily joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emily has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Emily is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 10th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to further improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":500436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

All of the members of the group are natives of Santa Cruz and the majority live in the Libertad neighborhood of the Puerto Rico district, which is how they chose the group's name. They are responsible people who know each other well and guarantee each other's repayment of the loan.\r\n\r\nEdilia is the president of the group. She is married and has three school-aged children. She sells cosmetics from catalogs and also sells clothing seasonally. Her husband is a salaried driver, but his pay does not cover their household's expenses so Edilia has her two businesses to help meet her family's needs.

","en":"Rosa Aminta Ben\u00edtez, 44, lives with her husband and three children, who are 19, 14 and 12 years of age in the San Francisco neighborhood of Catacamas, Olancho.\r\n\r\nShe started selling groceries ten years ago.  She would buy her stock on credit from a warehouse.  Three years ago, though, she decided to install a grocery store in her home and since she lacked funds at that time she asked FAMA for a loan and with that help was able to do so.

G. is 74 years old and her husband is the same age as her. They had 9 children, of whom 8 are living and 1 has passed away. Despite her age she still sells fruits and vegetables. She has installed a small stand in her home and whatever profits she makes in her  business she reinvests them in the purchase of more merchandise and to provide for some of her  husband's needs. Carmen is a very hardworking person and despite her advanced age and her diabetes she's never without an occupation to earn an income. Carmen has enjoyed being independent of her children by having her own money for whatever emergency comes up. She does not depend at all on her children. They each have their own obligations, family, and dependents to take care of. \r\n\r\nCarmen requested a loan to supplement her working capital, to invest in her small business. She is confident she will be able to repay the loan. This loan was used to purchase: bananas, oranges, mandarin oranges, apples, peaches, pineapples, watermelons, cantaloupes, tomatoes, chilli peppers, onions, garlic, romaine lettuce, potatoes, carrots, chayotes, and zucchini. \r\n\r\nCarmen's wish is to have no further complications in her health. Diabetes is a disease that requires much attention and a somewhat complicated treatment. She hopes not to have a health crisis, but she also wants to prosper with her business. She wants to see steady sales and to never fail to have enthusiasm and wish to work.\r\n\r\nHer hope is kept up when she is able to see her great grand children. Her husband is in good health. She hopes to not have to suffer and to one day pass away without pain. She says that she is not upset about the hour of her passing. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to all of those around the world who have taken the time to read about her life.  To all those individuals who feel sad or depressed, she wishes them to look up on her life as an example of how beautiful it is to reach her age. Life is a little box full of surprises, but one has to be ready for all those things that are in store for us. Thanks to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner).

N\u00fa\u00f1ez is married and has 11 children, including two who died, one of which in a transportation acccident and the other shortly after birth.  Emiliano states that losing these two sons emotionally affected him and his wife tremendously, but with the hlpe of their friends and families they were able to survive this tragedy of their lives.\r\n<p>\r\nEmiliana is an entrepreneur, during a number of year he ran a bar\/dining establishment in a space that he rented and that was waited on by his wife and girls. After a time he opened a new business, this time out of his own home, and until this day, it reamins the most important source of their earnings. The business they own is attended to mostly by his wife and it has been six years since they opened this space. At the same time they are dedicated to selling raw materials such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk products, bread products, canned products and products for the home, among other things.\r\n<p>\r\nThanks to their great aptitude for business and their ability to save, they were able to purchase a truck that they use to sell meats and sausages in the areas outside of the city. The loans that the Paraguay Foundation previously provided them with was a great help in order for them to maintain their business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Emiliano wishes to expand his business and open a mini market where he can sell a greater variety of merchandise and offer commodity\/choice for his clients. Currently, Emiliano is asking for a loan with which he can acquire larger quantities of merchandise for his store, and his providers will offer him discounted proces for the products he does buy.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Chlo\u00e9 Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEmiliano N\u00fa\u00f1ez, esta casado, tiene 11 hijos de los cuales dos ya fallecieron uno de ellos en un accidente de tr\u00e1nsito y otro a los pocos meses de nacer. Emiliano cuenta que la p\u00e9rdida de sus hijos le afecto mucho emocionalmente a \u00e9l y su esposa pero que con la ayuda de sus amigos y familiares pudieron sobre llevar el trago amargo que significo esto en sus vidas.<p>\r\nEmiliano es un hombre emprendedor, durante varios a\u00f1os administro un bar-comedor en un local que alquilaba y que era atendido tambi\u00e9n por su esposa e hijas. Luego de un tiempo abri\u00f3 otro negocio pero ya en su casa propia y que hasta hoy d\u00eda es la fuente de ingresos m\u00e1s importante que tienen. El negocio que tienen es una despensa que es atendida principalmente por su esposa y ya van seis a\u00f1os desde que abrieron su local. En la misma se dedican a vender insumos de primera necesidad como frutas, verduras, carne, l\u00e1cteos, panificados, productos enlatados, productos para el hogar, entre otras cosas.<p>\r\nGracias a su buena aptitud para los negocios y su sentido del ahorro, el pudo comprarse una camioneta que lo utiliza para vender carnes y embutidos recorriendo los barrios de la ciudad. Los cr\u00e9ditos que la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya le otorgo anteriormente tambi\u00e9n fueron una gran ayuda para mantener ambos negocios.<p>\r\n En el futuro, Emiliano, desea ampliar su despensa y abrir un mini market, en donde pueda vender mayor variedad de mercader\u00edas y ofrecer comodidad a sus clientes. Hoy d\u00eda Emiliano solicita un cr\u00e9dito con el que podr\u00e1 adquirir mercader\u00edas en grandes cantidades para su despensa, de este modo, sus proveedores le ofrecen muy buenos descuentos por su compra al por mayor.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":144396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase grass, sugar, bread, drinks, milk products, fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Mariano R.

Her two children do not depend on her anymore and have their own families. She lives by herself in her own home.

She sells women\u2019s apparel exclusively, made by people whom she hires. She likes what she does especially well because of the opportunity to meet many people. Local performance artists come to the shop to try on the clothing she sells and have their pictures taken, which is good publicity for the business.

She enjoys working with the communal bank because people there are very responsible and many have become good friends.

Eldard is a 36-year-old married man with eight children. For the last four years, he has been selling coffee as a means of subsistence. He began the business in Rugaga trading center in Bushenyi district with only 100,000 Ugandan shillings. At length, banking on his hard work ethic, he was able to increase his capital in a short period of time to 2.5 million shillings.\r\n\r\nCurrently Eldard\u2019s business generates him close to 150,000 shillings a month. This is little money by any Ugandan standards but it\u2019s with this paltry monthly earnings that he has struggled to educate all his children.\r\n\r\nBeing a resolutely hardworking and experienced businessman Eldard remains upbeat that he is going to succeed. The one vital resource he has invariably relied on to keep his business afloat has been that friendly chord he has struck with his customers. The high quality coffee he sells is in high favor with many people and coffee outlets.\r\n\r\nEldard\u2019s dream and future plan, as he makes steady progress in his business, is to have his own hybrid coffee plantations so that, from them, he can harvest coffee which he can competitively sell at a higher market price.

Her husband, Cezar A., is 73 years old.  They have eight children who are 32 to 50 years old. \r\n\r\nNicanora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1989 because she aspired for something better for her family.

Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family.  Nicanora A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from buying and selling dried fish and vegetables in the local community. Clementina has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Clementina joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clementina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Clementina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Clementina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of the her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: farming and selling rice.  Her common-law husband Mario Magbanua, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  She has three children who are 3 to 6 years old. Arlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arlyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase farming equipment and tools so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Arlyn T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Its 8 members have shown to date responsibility and the desire for self improvement each in her own business, either dependently or independently.  All, however, coinciD. in giving only the best to their loved ones and to improve daily.  Such is the case of:  Lidia who learned how to work as a micro businesswoman 12 years ago when her husband was laid off from his job.  \r\n\r\nShe figured out how to make knitted wool sweaters and cushions which helped her feed her children who are still minors.  Since income was still insufficient, she decided to also sell beauty products.  The sale of knitted items was good until the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon arrived affecting it and causing losses due to the unexpected weather change (summer).  Not being defeated, however, as she tells us, she had the great idea to make delicious sweets at home like Mazamorra Morada (jelly-like dessert maD. from purple maize), Bundt cakes, chocolate and vanilla cakes.  She also maD. potatoes with eggs, potato and ocopa (potato with peanut sauce) or potato with cream.  She would take her desserts either on trays or in pots to sell them.  She had to walk long blocks to sell in markets, stores, car repair shops, hardware stores.  In time, she acquired more customers thanks to the good service and taste of her home maD. products.\r\n\r\nLidia then became better trained in pastry making and realized she did it quite well.  She now makes cakes for all occasions and social events like fifteen-year birthday parties, weddings, baby showers, school graduation parties, birthdays or any other one she is asked to do.  This has been very good for her.  She never imagined that income from these sales would serve not only to face the difficult economic situation but also to proviD. her children with technical education which was one of her fondest dreams.  She hopes that they will finish their technical studies at a university to be at the same level as their competition in their specialties.\r\n\r\nLidia will use the loan to buy beauty products and cake making supplies on sale because she has several pending orders for school graduation events.\r\n\r\nLidia is second from the right and is wearing a striped blouse.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":651466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients for tortas and to buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T01:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene Edith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1090}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665387},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408630},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826922},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269183},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136070}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T21:43:23Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":256517,"name":"Jesus Divino Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cJESUS DIVINO AMOR\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.
