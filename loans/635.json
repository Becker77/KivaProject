It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The members decided to give the group this name because it is the name of the street where they have their meetings. This story is about Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix who is the group's representative.  She is 42 years old, married, and has three children: Esteban, \u00c1ngel and Cristal, who are all in school.  Her eldest is in his third year of high school, the next child is in his second year of junior high school and the youngest is in her sixth year of elementary school.  Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix has been preparing and selling Mexican snacks for ten years.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda F\u00e9lix decided to start this business because she needed to improve her family's quality of life and get her children ahead in life as she didn't have enough financial solvency to provide them with a better education and continue investing in her business.  She invested the loan that she received in buying the supplies she needed to continue making her rich dishes such as tomatoes, onions, potatoes, a variety of chilis, avocados, chicken, corn, tortillas, cheese and spices.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda F\u00e9lix would like to continue investing in her business so that she can grow it even more.  She would like to build premises, buy tables and chairs, and set up a restaurant selling Mexican food.  She would like to improve her production and increase and improve her sales and income so that she can continue supporting her children in their education and improving their quality of life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda F\u00e9lix says that all her fellow group members are responsible people and good payers.  They have all known each other for quite a long time as they are from the same community.

At the beginning of her entrepreneurial activity, she sold women's undergarments and had a small business turnover.  The selection of goods was also limited.  Salomat's husband works as a cook at a cafeteria, and his entire income gets used for family expenses.  Also, one of the client's sons works in Russia and sends them money for living expenses every month.  Salomat has been increasing her good turnover year after year with the help of the loans and used the resulting profits to marry off her daughter and repair her house.  Over the nine years of credit history, Salomat has not once violated the terms of the organization.  Over this time, she changed her place of business and today leases a container at the large clothing market, \"Somon,\" and her goods turnover increased several fold.  And also their social and family condition increased and improved.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237947,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They arranged a meeting to find out about the program, and accepted because it gave them the opportunity to increase their working capital and receive training sessions that would allow them to more fully develop themselves as people. They are very hard-working women, and this is a great opportunity for them, since they have never before received any kind of credit.  The committee is called Fel\u00edz (\u201cHappy\u201d), and they are currently in their fifth loan cycle. The group is made up of 18 hard-working, sacrificing women who strive each day to afford a better quality of life to themselves and their families.  All the group members are very active women, and have invested their loans in their respective activities. One of these women is Mrs. Antonia V., who sells fruits and vegetables in the Paraguar\u00ed market. She has a stand where she displays her fresh produce, which she buys from other group members. Some of the fruits she sells are oranges, bananas, pineapples and watermelon; some of the vegetables she sells are onions, tomatoes, carrots and hot peppers.  Her sales are very good, and help her pay her household expenses.

She lives in her own home with her partner Yuri, age 27, and their beloved son, to whom she wants to provide all the comforts. Zonia has spent the majority of her life in her beloved village of Rosario. From a very young age she learned the family business, and now she knows everything there is to know about farming. She now works on her own land with her beloved partner. They cultivate cocoa, coffee, and timber-yielding trees. This work has provided them with the necessary income to maintain their family. They sell everything that they harvest to the distribution centers in San Francisco city. There they receive better prices for all of their products. What she most enjoys about her work is sowing her lands, and she does so with great care. She has done this work for 10 years and finds the most difficult part to be transporting her products, since the freight cars are scarce in the Valle Rio Apurimac forest region. With time, she wants to buy new lands with the goal of increasing production. This will be her second loan with MFP, and she hopes for a small loan so that she can achieve her goals. She is prepared to repay her quotas. With the 3,000 requested soles, she will buy manure and natural fertilizers to improve her plants and thus benefit greatly from the harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":865875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase bags of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":259.94},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":265.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":271.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":284.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":291.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":302.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":316.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":324.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":337.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":344.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95.81,"local_amount":261.3,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":261.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851298},{"amount":99.97,"local_amount":272.64,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":272.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666481},{"amount":97.86,"local_amount":266.89,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":266.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621634},{"amount":105.47,"local_amount":287.64,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:45Z","rounded_local_amount":287.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835716},{"amount":106.54,"local_amount":290.55,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":290.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245478},{"amount":111.22,"local_amount":303.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":303.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385524},{"amount":116.4,"local_amount":317.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":317.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098611},{"amount":119.46,"local_amount":325.81,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":325.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712829},{"amount":125.18,"local_amount":341.4,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:22Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201943},{"amount":122.09,"local_amount":332.98,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":333.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097717}],"funded_date":"2011-09-13T05:44:51Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":338115,"name":"Nadien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadien is a 26-year-old young woman.

In this group, many of the women have already received loans and have their own small business. Dionicia S. is the group representative, and a great example of the power of micro-credit. She came to Esperanza International with no form of income and was living in extreme poverty. Dionicia is the mother of 4 older children, and had to give everything she had just to feed them. As her children got older and she started to have a little more time she realized she wanted something different from her life, and knew she had to do something about it. She then applied for a small loan so she could start her own small store, which she started as a small stand in her neighborhood. She sold simple things like candy, rice, and other cheaper items. She worked hard and was able to increase her business to the point today where she has her own small store! She is finally making some good money, and is happy with what she is doing. She can finally save money and help out her children when they need it. She finally feels like she can provide, and feels like she has something of her own. She is a great story of success, and is continuing to increase her business. She hopes to keep on increasing in size and hopes to have a giant store

This work keeps her occupied the entire day, mostly because she has to collect payments for the products she has distributed. For this reason she decided to become a business associate with her oldest daughter to start a drugstore in her house where they can work without having to travel to different locations. They can just focus on providing good customer service. \r\n\r\nFlorinda has been a part of MFP for many years, working in groups, but this is her first individual loan and she hopes to be reliable with her payments, the same way that she had been in her members group where they work as a team in an organized manner.

Se dedica a las labores agr\u00edcolas, en especial a la siembra de pi\u00f1as y como desde muy joven ha sembrado esta fruta, en su pueblo lo llaman \u201cel pi\u00f1ero\u201d. Todos estos a\u00f1os sus cultivos le han resultado muy rentables, la \u00fanica dificultad que tiene es que en el momento de la cosecha algunas hojas hieren sus manos hasta sangrar, a pesar de esto, le gusta mucho su trabajo y para comercializar sus productos los env\u00eda a un mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Lima. Samuel presta toda su atenci\u00f3n y cuidado a sus cultivos, puesto que sabe que gracias a ello adquiri\u00f3 un carro con el que ahora trabaja haciendo transporte de carga desde las chacras hasta el pueblo y eso le genera otro ingreso econ\u00f3mico. Ahora, sus sue\u00f1os est\u00e1n en conformar su propia familia, para despu\u00e9s emprender un negocio de compra y venta de frutas. Este es el quinto pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP, durante los cuatro periodos concluidos demostr\u00f3 responsabilidad en cada uno de sus pagos y del mismo modo se compromete a seguir cumpliendo. Cabe recalcar que Samuel es un hombre muy cumplidor, digno de confianza, tiene el cargo de fiscal en su banco comunal, puesto que en cada una de las reuniones demuestra formalidad, por lo que todos le guardan respeto. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de 28 sacos de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, calcula que le costar\u00e1 un aproximado de 2660 soles, el resto del dinero es para pagar el jornal de sus trabajadores.","en":"Samuel is 32 years old, single, and is a very consistent man.  He owns his own house but for lunch he often visits his mother\u2019s house.  He works in agriculture, especially planting pineapple, and because he has been planting this fruit ever since he was young, they call him \u201cEl pi\u00f1ero\u201d (The pineapple man) in his town.  \r\n<p>\r\nAll of these years his harvest has been very profitable.  The only difficulty that he has is that when he harvests the fruit some of the leaves cut his hands until they bleed, but in spite of this, he really likes his job.  To sell his produce he sends it to a wholesale market in the city of Lima.  Samuel puts all of his care and attention into his crops because he knows that thanks to them, he was able to buy a car which he now uses to transport cargo from farms to the town and this generates another source of income for him.\r\n<p>\r\nNow his dream is to satisfy his family\u2019s needs, so that later he can start a business buying and selling fruit.  This is his 5th loan with MFP.  During the previous four terms he showed responsibility in each one of his payments and he intends to continue the same way.  It should be emphasized that Samuel is a very reliable, honorable, trustworthy man.  He holds the fiscal manager position in his communal bank and he takes each of the meetings seriously, for which all members respect him.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan he is requesting is for the purchase of 28 bags of chemical fertilizers, which he calculates will cost about 2660 Soles, the rest of the money is to pay his day laborers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":337788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer and pay day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-17T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3530.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992331}],"funded_date":"2009-06-19T02:39:54Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary McKee","image":355625}},{"id":120093,"name":"Purevsuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Purevsuren S., 60, lives with his wife and two children in Arhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting corn for sale. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Victoria joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victoria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Victoria is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Victoria from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The thing she likes most about her Communal Bank are the meetings with the members and the punctuality.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":443692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fodder and animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":89.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954353},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":89.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987366},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":89.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713376},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746471}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T17:04:23Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":165433,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy A. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela.

This would be a unique opportunity since a children\u2019s stylist did not exist in the area, so she decided to turn this idea into an innovative enterprise.\n\nZurelly says she gives credit to God and to her family for the chance to work together to make this idea a reality.  She and her three sisters started by teaching other employees how to work with them since finding qualified staff is a great challenge.  They must learn the techniques for establishing relationships, demonstrating patience, and being sensitive with their star clients, the children.  \n\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Zurelly and her family have invested all of their savings so that they could move forward with their dream.  Their efforts have been invested in advertising because trying to draw publicity is not an easy task.  At the moment, Zurelly needs operating capital to diversify the services she offers.  She needs different types of supplies such as coloring, flowers, ribbons, and adornments used for styling children\u2019s hair.\n\nHer dream is to have a separate area within her business where she can sell general accessories for babies and children.  Zurelly says her greatest satisfaction comes from knowing that with God\u2019s help, anything is possible.  She continues to demonstrate perseverance, dedication, commitment, and love in order to achieve her goals.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":607105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies used for styling children's hair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zurelly  Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":142153},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":152544},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155468},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":158448},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":161485},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":164580},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167734},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":170949},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":174226},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":177565},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":180968},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":193880}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.35},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.96,"local_amount":142153,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":144089.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550767},{"amount":85.81,"local_amount":152544,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":154622.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688376},{"amount":188.01,"local_amount":334248,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:44Z","rounded_local_amount":338802.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427596},{"amount":401.65,"local_amount":714043,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":723771.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289024},{"amount":99.98,"local_amount":177741,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":180162.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230183},{"amount":121.5,"local_amount":215999,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":218941.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509056},{"amount":148.09,"local_amount":263272,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":266859.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673286}],"funded_date":"2010-10-05T12:48:15Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":239769,"name":"Debie Reynette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Debie Reynette M. is from the village of Wigan, Santiago.

She lives with her partner and their three children in their own home, which they were able to purchase with much effort.  Rosa sells clothing and acquires her merchandise in the city of Lima.  She has a friend who lives in that city and ships to her the clothes that her customers order.  Rosa has been in this business for one year.  Thanks to her partner, she has been able to attract many customers.  What she likes about this job is being able to generate an income so that she can help her partner with the household expenses and meet the needs of their children.  However, she must be selective of the customers to whom she sells because she has had several who have failed to pay.  Her greatest wish is to open a clothing store.  She knows that the only way to accomplish this goal is to press forward with great dedication and sacrifice.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP organization.  Rosa feels comfortable with her Communal Bank group because she considers the members to be responsible and supportive individuals.  The amount she requested will be invested in more clothing in larger quantities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":910888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing in bulk.

For the past four years he has worked in a bakery which makes traditional bread, sometimes called naan, Bukharan bread, or lepeshka.  He bakes bread for sale wholesale. The business yields a return, but the fact is that the demand increases in the wintertime and he is unable to purchase flour.  Therefore he has decided to take out a loan, which will enable him to increase his output as well as attract new customers.

They have two children, ages 9 and 13. Both are in school, one in high school, the other in elementary. Anita's husband is a fish vendor.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnita runs her own hog breeding and fattening business while also attending to the needs of her children at home and doing the household chores. Anita's business started about the time she got married. At that time, she had no means of financing a hog breeding and fattening business, so she only bought piglets to fatten. Once fattened hogs are sold, after four months, the original capital is replenished; in fact, profit from this kind of business can be as much as double its capital. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen Anita joined the Kiva field partner, ASHI, in 2003, she was able to get a loan. That's when she started her hog breeding and fattening business. Now Anita has two gilts (female pigs raised for breeding) that produce piglets. Instead of selling piglets for $32 to $53, Anita chose to fatten the piglets and sell them in volume after four months, bringing in from $85 to $127 each. Profits from her business finance the family's daily needs and support her husband's fish selling business. \r\n<p>\r\nThis kind of business also incurs a lot of expenses when piglets are newly born. They need immunizations and vaccinations to insure better growth. Feed is also expensive. In order to sustain her business by meeting its financial needs, Anita is requesting a loan from ASHI that will be much larger than the one she had previously. \r\n<p>\r\nSomeday, Anita wants to have her own piggery, where she would breed and raise a lot of pigs.  She also wants all of her children to be able to finish college.

Florencia needs a new loan in the amount of P15,000.00 so she can purchase goods in advance to get more rebates from suppliers.

She is a very cheerful person and always makes her sales with a hugh smile. She has been in business for 20 years and what is the most difficult is purchasing the alcohol as there are many falsified products and you have to know how to tell the difference. In the future Irma would like to have a larger store where she can sell many goods and not just limit it to alcohol. What she likes most it talking with her customers, because them she finds out from them what is happening while she is at work. This is her second loan with MPF.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Most of them live in large traditional families and, on average, are 43 years old and have four children. They all live in Darabougou, a village located in the rural municipality of Sako\u00efba (fourth administrative region of Mali). They know each other through ties of kinship, marriage or neighborhood, or because they are members of the same traditional women's association for mutual aid in their village.\r\n\r\nThis is the first solidarity loan with Soro Yiriwaso for the members of Benkadi Group. The women have various trading activities. A few of them buy and sell firm round cabbages, shea butter, calabashes and henna.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Mrs Yama C.. She excels in the preparation and sale of food dishes, such as millet fritters and bean tidbits. She will use her loan to buy 50 kilograms of small millet, 10 kilograms of beans, 4 liters of oil, half a package of yeast, 3 kilograms of sugar and 2 kilograms of iodized salt, in her village and at the weekly fair in S\u00e9gou. She explained to us how she prepares her dishes:\r\n\r\n<i>Yama's recipe for millet fritters:<\/i> Pound the millet, remove the bran and wash thoroughly. Take part of it and mash it. Add this pulp to the flour previously obtained  through pounding and  knead. Add salt, sugar and yeast to the mixture. Fry the pulp in oil. Do this early in the morning and serve for breakfast.\r\n\r\n<i>Yama's recipe for bean tidbits:<\/i> Transform the beans into flour. Add a few pinches of salt and stir vigorously. Fry the batter in oil. Ideally, do this in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMrs Yama enjoys a solid reputation thanks to the high quality of her tidbits.\r\n\r\nThe group members sell from their homes, for cash and credit, to a clientele made up of men, women and children.\r\n\r\nYama expects to make a monthly profit of 10,000 CFA francs which she will use to increase her working capital.\r\n\r\n<i>NB:<\/i> Alimata Traor\u00e9 is not pictured.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. Jean is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase raw materials for food vending. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP10,000 which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJean aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

However, life conditions teach them to manage time properly and make it work.\r\n\r\nAkjol J. U., 20, is a member of this group. He is a resident of a small town, Kadamjai, which is known for the largest antimony (a brittle, metallic element) factory in the country. Akjol is a sophomore in a local university and works in a local retail market of foodstuffs. Life became complicated for Akjol two years ago when his mother, who initially used to run this business, fell ill with a strong disease. Her disease requires constant treatment and bed rest, so Akjol, being the only male in the family, took upon himself the responsibility for the financial stability of the family. \r\n\r\nTwo years in business helped Akjol to learn gradually the best ways of increasing his sales. He orients on customers\u2019 shifts in taste, price of the products and quality. The derived profit is spent on the basic needs of the family and payment for his tuition. The initial start-up capital was 20,000 soms; now it yields him 10,000 soms per month. Akjol is in hopes of getting the loan, because he would spend it on medical treatment for his mother. One of the major dreams of Akjol is to increase the entire capital to 100,000 soms and buy an automobile.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Samata.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Faasegia has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 800 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faasegia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faasegia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Faasegia is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Faasegia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmerita hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Essentially they produce and sell food (soumbala, which is a fermented paste made from locust seeds; and local beverages).  \r\n\r\nThe search for supplementary financial resources is the reason why this group of women has decided to collaborate with the institution  After having correctly repaid the first solidarity loan (group loan), the group is on its second loan.  These women each intend to use this new loan to buy 250 kg of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (locust seeds), a large stock of firewood, and various other articles.  They get their supplies locally at the marketplaces of Oueless\u00e9bougou and its surrounding areas for n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (from a tree that is a source of oil in sub-Saharan regions).  As for the various articles, such as powdered juices, dah (fried hibiscus blossoms), sugar, and plastic bags, they buy them from Bamako (capital of Mali) and sometimes locally.  \r\n\r\nThey make their sales locally out of homes in the village and to retailers who come from the big cities, such as Bougouni, Bamako, and Kati. Sales are generally made in cash. They each intend to realize a monthly profit of 36,000 francs CFA, which will be used essentially to bolster their working capital.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":207198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy raw materials for making soumbala and local soft drinks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:04:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-24T15:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":525000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350959},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974022},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889395},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440188},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135556},{"amount":195.85,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033357}],"funded_date":"2008-10-10T15:00:00Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":70989,"name":"Mrs. Mork Nhoth Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Mork N., a group leader of five who all live in Svay Prey Village in Kampong Cham Province, recently married Mrs. Yorn Yeth, a construction worker.

She usually works alone because her partner is involved in a different activity and her daugher is in school.  Her business earns good profits thanks to the effort she puts into it.  She goes out at 9am and works until 6pm only coming home to prepare lunch and care for her family.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to set up a store in her house so that she can sell more comfortably.  For this, however, she needs more capital and she still doesn't have the necessary time to dedicate to her business because she must care for her daughter and see to household chores.  This is why the store is still in her future plans.\r\n\r\nThis is Betty's 4th loan with MFP and she promisses to be as punctual now with her repayments as she's been in the past.\r\n\r\nShe will use
