Today, he offers English language training and translation services to all willing to master this language or needing the help of an interpreter. <p>\r\n\r\nGennadyi has a perfect credit history.

Porridge is one of the popular local foods; it is enjoyed as breakfast by almost all Ghanaians. It is prepared from milled maize or millet grains, which is boiled and eaten with sugar, milk and bread or eaten with what we call Kose. Kose is prepared from milled beans and it is fried with cooking oil, so in just 20 minutes it is ready to be served with the porridge. With a large customer base, she wants to use the loan to buy more raw materials like bags of maize, millet, beans, sugar and milk to increase production. She hopes to earn a good income to support her children in school. Mari belongs to a village bank called \u2018Yeda Nyame ase\u2019 which means We Thank God.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating a pedicab transport service. Lydia has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lydia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to repair her existing vehicle for better service. Lydia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair her existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Lydia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Additionally, Marta has ambitions to use the larger profits she will realize from selling more fruit to begin to stock a small fantasia (a variety store, usually with underwear, school supplies, cosmetics, and jewelry) that she will operate from her home.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Where Marta lives, her home is at risk from flooding when the river swells during hurricanes and tropical storms. Also, the house that she lives in has a leaky roof and weak walls. With the money that Marta hopes to gain from her fruit stand and fantasia, she plans to first improve her house with a stronger roof and cement walls. However, in the long run, her goal is to move away from the river to a neighborhood on high ground. She firmly believes that this is the right thing to do for herself and her husband, but, particularly, she wants her children to be able to grow in a stable house so that they will be able to focus on their schooling.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>This is Marta's third loan from Esperanza. She has successfully repaid the first two loans. Marta described how, at first, she was afraid to take out a loan because she was very poor and was worried that she would not be able to pay back the loan. However, after discussing the loan with her husband, and much prayer, she decided that she would take the loan. Thus far, Marta says Esperanza has helped her to expand her business and earn more money, in addition to repaying her loan. Now, she says that she has more confidence in herself and her business abilities. When asked what she had to say to potential Kiva lenders, Marta said \"I hope that they will lend as much money as possible to help people like me, because it has helped people like me to live a better life and give a better life to their children.\"<\/P>

She hopes to have no problems in paying the loan back so she can apply for others in order to keep improving her business and her family's quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":398139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy basic food products for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-02T18:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":19.56,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina Armando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.3},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85.14,"local_amount":2321.92,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816793},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":1159.08,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-21T07:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938033},{"amount":4.34,"local_amount":126.43,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":128971979},{"amount":66.32,"local_amount":1860.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1877.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":1.91,"payment_id":136698576},{"amount":332.14,"local_amount":9531.77,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":9618.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":17.36,"payment_id":151916003}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T22:48:40Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Lucca","image":259290}},{"id":145609,"name":"Karina Selene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Karina Selene.

He is 49 years old. Martin is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Martin is starting a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling health & medicinal products in the local community. Martin is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Martin joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Martin is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Martin from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ellos viven en casa propia, construida de adobe con techo de teja.\n\n\u00c9l es pensionado, desde sus 25 a\u00f1os de edad, ya que laboro para una empresa, donde se desempe\u00f1o como obrero de maquinas estiradotas, cumpliendo con la labor de deshilar la penca del henequ\u00e9n, para luego pasarlas a las hiladoras.\n\nEn los \u00faltimos 17 a\u00f1os, Jos\u00e9 se ha dedicado al cultivo de ma\u00edz, siembra normalmente 7000 metros cuadrados, produciendo 40 quintales de ma\u00edz (4000 libras), tambi\u00e9n, trabaja como jornal devengando un salario de $5.00 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda. A pesar de su edad, tiene la suficiente fuerza para realizar trabajos de campo.\n\nLa compra de los insumos agr\u00edcolas y la venta de su cosecha, las realiza en la ciudad, esta se encuentra a cinco kil\u00f3metros de su comunidad, se trasporta en autob\u00fas y en la palangana de un carro.\n\nEl prestamos ser\u00e1 invertido, en la cancelaci\u00f3n de un cr\u00e9dito vigente en Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, y el resto ser\u00e1 para pagar mano de obra de la cosecha de ma\u00edz y pago de la maquina desgranadora.

They live in their own home, built of adobe with a tile roof.\r\n\r\nHe is retired. From the time he was 25, he worked for a business operating a sisal fiber extractor, which involved scraping the leaves of the sisal plant before sending them to the spinners.\r\n\r\nFor the past 17 years, Jos\u00e9 has cultivated corn, normally planting 7,000 sq. meters and producing 40 hundredweights (4,000 pounds). He also works as a day laborer, earning a salary of $5 a day. Despite his age, he has enough energy to work in the fields.\r\n\r\nHe purchases farming supplies and sells his crop in the city, which is about five kilometers from his neighborhood. He uses the bus or the bed of a truck for transportation.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in paying off an outstanding loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Campo with the remainder used to pay a work force to harvest his corn crop and to pay for the threshing machine. Sr. Jos\u00e9 expects to harvest 20 hundredweights (2,000 pounds) of corn from planting half a manzana of land (3,500 sq. meters). Consequently, he will sell his crop at a good price since corn production was low this year. In addition, he will avoid having the corn stolen from his fields.\r\n\r\nSr. Jos\u00e9 has two lots and wants to build houses for each one of his children so they can study at least through high school, and can work and support themselves economically. He is teaching them how to farm and, of course, inculcating in them moral values such as honesty, responsibility and love for their neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":904429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to pay off an outstanding loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo, with the remainder used to pay a work force to harvest his corn and to pay for the threshing machine.

She is 36 years old, a widow and mother of a 6 year-old son. Also living with her are her mother and a sister - she provides for both of them as well. Her father's passing when she was very young created financial difficulties for the family, and Virginia had to drop out of the school while on the 8th grade. Unfortunately, in 2007, after 10 years of marriage, she also lost her husband. Virginia makes her living by selling chickens, and a small variety of assorted articles, without help from additional employees. She is able to purchase these small articles for 80 rands (200,00mt) and sell them for 420,00mt, generating a monthly income of 10000,00mt. This is Virginia's second loan request from Hluvuku and the first through Kiva. She applied the whole loan amount of 15000,00mt from the first loan in her business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Malingin, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is married to Eliseo T., who owns and operates a machine shop.  They have a 12-year-old child who is currently in school. \r\n<p>\r\nLina and her husband are entrepreneurs.  Even before she got married, Lina already had her own general store, while her husband already had his machine shop. When they got married, it looked as if they would have a stable life, with both of them already having their own livelihoods. But sharp economic downturns can befall anyone. At one point, Eliseo wanted to give up his machine shop because he thought that he could no longer afford to buy the necessary spare parts for his machines and he was worried about the competition. But Lina encouraged him to go on and not to lose hope.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause she was able to spare some of her capital from the general store to help her husband's business, they were able to survive that crisis. That event opened Eliseo's eyes to the fact that, in order to grow, they needed to have additional capital. When he heard about NWTF-Project Dungganon, he encouraged Lina to join, which she did in 2004. From then on she was able to borrow money to use as capital for both the general store and the machine shop, helping both businesses thrive.\r\n<p>\r\nOn her 4th loan cycle, Lina expanded her general store and also purchased additional materials for her husband's machine shop. Their combined monthly net income from their businesses provides them with 12,000 pesos per month, which they mostly plow back into the businesses after setting some money aside for household expenses and savings for the education of their only child.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous 14th loan cycle, Lina borrowed 19,000 pesos and this amount contributed to the continued success of the family businesses. She was able to pay everything back on time and in full. She plans to borrow 20,000 pesos for her 15th loan cycle, so that she can buy more items to sell in her general store. She plans to use the profits to rent a farm so that she can increase her income even further. She has high hopes for the future of her child.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

He lives with his partner, Cinthya, with whom he has two beautiful children:  Rani, 5 and Amisha, 3.  They live in their own home in the Ventanilla district, north of Lima.  For the past 7 years he has repaired electric appliances although recently he has been working on vehicles.  Eduardo is passionate about his work and always carries it out with great pleasure but, as he says, 'It's not at all easy\" since it requires a great deal of precision and effort.  Happily, he does it with dedication and that causes his customers to leave his shop happy which, in turn, leaves him with good profits.  For the future he would like to have another, equally profitable business; he has thought of opening a hardware store so as to have a family business.  This is his third loan with MFP and he has always been very punctual with his repayments.  With these funds he will purchase some replacement parts that he needs for some of the vehicles that have been left for him to repair.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He is 51 years old. Ariston is married and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Ariston owns and operates a business venture in the food sector: operating a fishing business. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Ariston has been engaged in his business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ariston joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ariston has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. Ariston is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Ariston from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from his business to supplement the income of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has had to go through a lot of adversity in her life. Nevertheless, she has always had the strength to get ahead, and to continue progressing with her family. She is a wise farmer, whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. Jane farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past 20 years she has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Jane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making a profit selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Jane mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy another motorbike. Jane is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge which has caused her to suffer many losses. Perishable products, such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market in order to fetch a high price. Through this loan, Jane is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Jane feels relieved to know that there are institutions, such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Jane will never suffer losses due to delay in the delivery of her produce to the market. She will also increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. This will provide her with increased income. Jane is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone who will ride the motorbike and help with farm work. With your loan, Jane will improve her living conditions, and assure her children and grandchildren to come of a secure future. Support a hardworking woman with a loan!

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVilla Florida\u201d is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea-level, in the community of Huanchos, in the district of Paucarbamba, province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are the growing of corn, potatoes and wheat, and also raising cows, bulls and sheep. In the small town the population have some shops and proviD. several services. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank has initiated its fourth loan cycle with 15 female borrowers and a total loan of 6,200 soles (about 2,225 US$). The loans range from 200, 400, 600, and up to 1,200 soles. The group already is in its fourth loan cycle, with one and half years of existence, and is one of the \u201coldest\u201d community banks is the Wari project. In the time with FINCA Peru the members have learned to save, be more responsible with money and in their business. They have learned to be punctual and to respect each other. The dream for all is to make their business grow and to have a higher income in future.  Most of the members use their loans for buying school supplies for the children or to increase merchandise for their business.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Sonilda Trist\u00e1n T.. Sonilda has a small shop where she sells marmalades and sweets with she buys in Huancayo. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more things for her business.  Over time, with FINCA Per\u00fa she was able to save over 500 soles, which she used took out to buy herself a refrigerator. And her future savings she will use for making her house a little more comfortable and buying a television.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnother story tells of Flor Edith V. Trist\u00e1n, a mother of 2 children: one of 6 years, the other 3 years old. She has her business of raising small animals like pigs, chickens and guinea-pigs.

In addition to that she will buy materials to improve her home which is also her restaurant. \r\n\r\nAntonieta is very happy about everything she has achieved with the help of the Manuela Ramos Movement.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":269295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase rice, sugar, milk, jars, ect. to be able to make the daily specials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bellavista - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.066667 -76.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T22:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":175.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418186},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":175.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111652},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":175.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006844},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":166.99,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":176.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590497},{"amount":54.06,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":175.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984795},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":175.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205236}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T17:32:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:13:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"James Lombardo","image":66911}},{"id":92297,"name":"Lea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lea is 23 years old, living in with her common-law husband, and blessed with a 1-year old child.

Dentro de sus labores como madre  tuvo que buscar alguna actividad que no afectara sus roles dentro de su hogar  y con el tiempo tuvo la oportunidad de aprender de tejido y bordado que le ayudaron a ejercer una actividad dentro de su hogar. La mayor\u00eda de pedidos que recibe son para exportaci\u00f3n, pues trabaja, en algunas ocasiones, en la producci\u00f3n de chompas bordadas y tejidas de dise\u00f1os altamente apreciados por los extranjeros. Pero estos pedidos tienen sus temporadas durante el a\u00f1o, dejando meses libres de producci\u00f3n, y para seguir trabajando Elsa vende carteras o mochilas en las calles o a sus vecinas pues como madre y padre para sus hijos tiene la responsabilidad de satisfacer las necesidades de sus peque\u00f1os.

Since she had children she learned a variety of tasks to finish building her home, but it isn\u2019t easy to be alone, responsible for the needs of one\u2019s children. As a mother she has had to look for work that wouldn\u2019t impact her work at home and over time she had the opportunity to learn sewing and knitting that they helped her carry out from within her home.  The majority of the orders she receives are for export, at times she works in producing sewn and knitted sweaters in designs valued by foreigners. But these orders have their particular seasons throughout the year, leaving months of production open, and in order to continue working Elsa sells wallets or backpacks in the streets or to her neighbors because as both mother and father to her children she has the responsibility of meeting the needs of her little ones. Her wish is to open a store in her home where she can sell a variety of products to her neighbors. Tula has been working with MFP for 7 years, and this is her 13th loan. Along with her colleagues, they have obtained a wonderful friendship that is a reflection of the good work that they do as a group, as they constantly try to develop activities to help strengthen their communal bank. The money she seeks now will be invested in buying material such as fabric and thread that she needs for her products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":300631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Materials for her artisan products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-11T02:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":268.84},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":280.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":291.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":306.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":319.51},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":332.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85.87,"local_amount":268.84,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":270.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012420},{"amount":89.74,"local_amount":280.94,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":282.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596009},{"amount":93.17,"local_amount":291.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":293.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990273},{"amount":97.98,"local_amount":306.7,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":308.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211397},{"amount":102.07,"local_amount":319.51,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":321,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640905},{"amount":106.17,"local_amount":332.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":333.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080372}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T05:19:00Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":104585,"name":"Sokhna","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Sokhna D., 54 ans est membre de banc villageois de Pout Diack depuis 6 ans et demi.

She has worked there for nine years. She started there as a janitor, then began to go to school. However, studying was difficult due to her economic situation and the best she could achieve was a promotion at her job. \r\n<p>\r\nMarithza is 26 years old and lives in neighborhood 380 with her husband and one-year-old son. Their house is livable, but lacks plaster, and interior walls for privacy.

The houses in this district are surrounded by a stream where ships with heavy cargo pass by. Her house is made of cement and has all the basic services. She is a single mother with a son of 11, who attends public school.\r\n\r\nSandra began her business selling typical foods of Ecuador four months ago, with the help of her mother, in a place next to her house. She sells chicken with rice, noodles, and her specialties -- rice with vegetable stew and all kinds of meat empanadas. Every day at 6 am, she buys the ingredients for the food in the market.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she wants to buy rice, tins of oil, and pots for her business of typical foods. In the future, she wants to have other locations to sell food.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

is a married woman with three children whose husband is a truck driver.  However, in spite of that, his job is very tiring, it keeps him away from home, and he makes very little money.  In addition, he is losing a lot of time that he could spend with his children and attend their events at school.  Domitila isn't defeated by this obstacle and always tries to raise her children well and continue moving forward. Therefore, she looked for a job that wouldn't take her out of the house all day so she could be with her children so they wouldn't feel so alone and so at the same time, she could make some money.  This was how she started to sell shoes from a catalog.  Little by little, she has been looking for new customers so that she can contribute to the expenses in the absence of her husband.<p>\r\n\r\nLately, the situation in her house has become very difficult because her husband's trips have been longer, keeping him away from home for longer periods of time.  Because of this, she had to use her earnings to feed her children and today she has no money to be able to restock with new products to sell.  Therefore, Domitila is asking for a loan of $375 that she will pay back in in 6 months.  She will use this money to buy merchandise for the winter season.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, she sells fruit and vegetables. She has worked in the business for more than 23 years. She started with little income, but a great desire to succeed. As she traveled to many different areas offering her products from a truck, her business advanced. The loan that she requests is for working capital to purchase products. She hopes to purchase her own home, since she doesn\u2019t have anything to leave to her children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":349851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-10T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Dinora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":890.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174540},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":890.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599983},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":890.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035872},{"amount":47.13,"local_amount":890.31,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":932.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948266},{"amount":42.87,"local_amount":809.69,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":848.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790196},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":890.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680862},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":890.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075398},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":890.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911447},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":890.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947295},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":890.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675584}],"funded_date":"2009-07-23T02:22:30Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":125081,"name":"Khalil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalil is a 45-year-old married man with four children.

Her husband works from time to time as a fisherman, and since it is difficult to support a family with this activity, Luisa decided five years ago to support the family finances with a business selling fresh fish.  She started to sell fish in the streets, and little by little her business grew. Now she sells in the towns of the region that don't have access to the sea and sporadically she also sells in the city of Tumbes, which is six hours from the city of Chiclayo.  Generally when she travels to Tumbes she distributes some advance orders, but the majority of times she sells in the area market.  She goes to purchase merchandise in the district fisheries terminal two or three times per week; she also sells salted dried fish that are processed there.  Currently her children are about to finish school.  Luisa would like to provide them with the opportunity to study in a university, but the income that her business generates is not sufficient to achieve this desire.  For this reason she is planning on expanding her business with the purchase of more fish to process and sell, financed by a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2000 nuevos soles.  She wishes to continue working with her husband so that they can buy an automobile and to use it to transport passengers in a transportation business that covers the Chiclayo-Santa Rosa route.  Luisa has worked with Edpyme Alternativa on other opportunities and in all of them she has demonstrated responsibility and punctuality in her payments, and for this reason she is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":391032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fish to process and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa -

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, moreover, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband helps her, staying to care for their still quite young children, helping with the business, and doing the household chores.\r\n\r\nWith this job, she has been able to buy some land, where she has been able to build, little by little, the house in which her family currently lives, and she has been able to, above all, pay for her eldest daughter's university tuition.  Her greatest wish is to buy a stand in the market where she works so she can stop paying rent and buy a taxi she can rent, which would provide additional income.  She is already planning how she will pay for her younger son's university tuition when he starts next year.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva

He decided on opening his shop because he saw a need in his region for such a shop. His clients can be anyone, but mainly they are his friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nElyas has already taken advantage of a first loan from Al Majmoua and he's pleased with his decision to take his second. He has been very punctual with his repayments and has repaid his entire loan on time. \r\n\r\nToday, Elyas has chosen to take a new loan of $3,000 to increase his selection of sports clothes in order to increase his sales and so his income. He hopes to further expand his business by opening a second sports shop.

They have 3 children who are between the ages of 7 and 12 years old.   \r\n\r\nJenny Ann  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jenny Ann  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP,  increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the store so that she could continue to save up for future education of her children.  Jenny Ann  R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her spouse gave her money to buy supplies and start up the business selling tacos on Saturdays and Sundays.  She is happy with the loan she got, because she will buy supplies needed to prepare tacos and keep her customers happy.  Her business matters, because it helps her financially.  She is happy when people are satisfied with the service provided.  She feels proud when they tell her that her tacos are tasty, and they come back for more tacos.  She uses the earnings to invest in supplies, and gradually is expanding her business, for things that her son needs in school, and things needed at home.  \n\nShe hopes to build a house on a piece of land she has in Jaloxtoc, and for her business to continue to grow, in order to provide a better life for her children, and for them to have what they need. \n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":813280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy meat, produce, nopal (type of cactus), and bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavia Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lazaro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":787.5,"local_amount":9187.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9267.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201829},{"amount":539.26,"local_amount":6291.42,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6346.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807420},{"amount":414.23,"local_amount":4832.64,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4874.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618515},{"amount":59.01,"local_amount":688.44,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":694.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573418}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T10:27:01Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":322618,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a single parent taking care of five dependants.

This school, established in 1978, is staffed with six teachers and has about 200 pupils. The staff of this institution, like many other schools\u2019 staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, comes to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise be unable to accomplish with their mere salaries. Some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy furniture, land or house-building materials; others invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

His father instilled love of animals in all his children and nowadays they are all in business with livestock raising and fattening. Together with his elder brother, Sultan would go to all the neighboring markets to buy bulls and cows. <P>A year ago Sulton got his first loan of $300. Having added his own money, he bought 12 young bulls of the same breed for himself from neighboring Kyrgystan.  As it turned out, the bulls were of tribal breed, so after 4 months of their sale, it turned out that Sulton had doubled the money he had received.

She is a member of TYM fund since 2001.  In the beginning  the loans were of small amounts so she could only use it to buy goods to resell. The profit margin was small, it was difficult. As a side job, she offered child care service for the families in her neighborhood. The demand was so great that the idea of opening a child care center was germinated in her head. She consulted her family members about this and decided to do so. At first, there were a lot of obstacles:  lack of capital,  lack of  material  and especially the paperwork procedure from the Education Ministry was lengthy and complicated. It also took a lot of effort and time to attend \"child care education\" classes to obtain the permit. After a few years of hard work and dedication, everything was set in place. She gained trust and support from everyone including the Education Ministry and her customers. Her husband is very supportive, everyday he  goes to the market to buy grocery to prepare food for the kids.

Sus hijos son los que trabajan manejando las motos y en algunas ocasiones las alquilan por d\u00eda. Estar pendiente de este negocio no es muy dif\u00edcil, pues solo tiene que controlar las horas de salida y servicio, y sobre todo ver si el veh\u00edculo est\u00e1 siendo utilizado cuidadosamente. Y para no sentirse inactiva, Mar\u00eda tambi\u00e9n vende comida en la puerta de su cada, retomando sus habilidades como vendedora, sin dejar de lado la administraci\u00f3n de sus motos.

El dinero que solicita esta vez es para el mantenimiento de sus motos y para la compra de utensilios y v\u00edveres para retomar la venta de comida. ","en":"Through many years of work, Maria and her husband were able to have a house to live in and a means of employment to support themselves. At 68 years of age, she continues to have the same vitality to get ahead together with her family. The drive she always had to perform her different activities helps her to carry out her current work and she has gained a lot of experience. Three years ago she had the opportunity to acquire two motorcycles and since then has been administrating the daily income from their passenger transportation service. Her children are the ones who drive the motorcycles and occasionally they rent them by day. Keeping an eye on this business is not very difficult, as she only has to control the hours the vehicles leave and their service, and above all see that the vehicle is being used carefully. So that she does not feel inactive, Marian also sells meals from her front door, using her abilities as a saleswoman while not neglecting the administration of her motorcycles. Do\u00f1a Maria has been with MFP for 7 years and this is her thirteenth loan. This makes her happy, as sharing with her fellow members is pleasant because they make a nice working group. The money she requests this time is for maintenance of her motorcycles and to buy utensils and supplies for the sale of food.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":290761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance for motorcycles and investment in a food business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T14:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":216.06},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":234.99},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":243.96},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":256.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":268.08},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":280.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.41},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.24},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.89},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.41,"local_amount":216.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":216.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012240},{"amount":74.41,"local_amount":234.99,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:41Z","rounded_local_amount":235.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595820},{"amount":77.25,"local_amount":243.96,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":244.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990088},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":256.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":257.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211220},{"amount":84.89,"local_amount":268.08,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":268.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640728},{"amount":88.79,"local_amount":280.37,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":280.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080201}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T15:38:32Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":100521,"name":"Elencith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Elencith, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d, vive en el Jr. Nereo Cabello cdra. 01, Distrito de San Jos\u00e9 de Sisa, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

Tras haber sufrido un terrible accidente hace 20 d\u00edas atr\u00e1s, Alicia ha quedado con heridas en su cuerpo y en el rostro, por eso se cubre la cara con una chalina para evitar que el sol genere mayores infecciones. Antes de este accidente trabajaba diariamente en las chacras de sus padres y de suegros; \u00faltimamente, con su esposo, decidieron sembrar papas y arvejas dejando a sus peque\u00f1as al cuidado de su madre.

El dinero que ahora solicitan lo piensa invertir en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y algunas medicinas para su recuperaci\u00f3n oportuna.   ","en":"Alicia is 27 years old and lives her husband and their two daughters, Daniela, 5, and Mayori, 2, in a home given to her by her parents. After suffering a terrible accident 20 days ago, Alicia was left with injuries to her body and face, which is why she covers her face with a scarf to block out the sun and stave off worse infections. Before the accident, she worked daily on the fields of her parents and in-laws. Ultimately, she and her husband decided to plant potatoes and peas of their own while they left their daughter in the care of Alicia's mother. Alicia really enjoys working on the land because it's something she has done since she was very little, and now that she is recovering from her ailments at home she is very bored. Since then, her husband has been the only one working on the crops, and she hopes she'll be able to get better soon so she can help with the harvest since that's when the most work is required, but once it passes everything relaxes until the next planting.

When he first started his business, he passed through some financial issues, but he is a hardworking man and does his best to improve his work.\r\n\r\nToday, for the first time, Ali is requesting a loan from Kiva partner, Al Majmoua, to purchase a generator for his work. It is important to note that, in Lebanon, there are a lot of electricity shutdowns, and people need to either have their own generator, or have a subscription from someone who provides

She makes good use of her good relations with the police depot which is quite near her living quarters and with the associated clinic. That is how her business got its start. Gradually she has been adding new customers and new merchandise by means of specialized product guides. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She plans to use it to supply the large volumes of refrigerated meats which have already been ordered for the end-of-the-year season during which her customers prepare their most scrumptious dishes to celebrate the New Year. With the investment of this new capital she hopes to generate a bigger increase in her profits due to the good number of customers who have already placed their orders and because it is the season in which Leopoldina takes advantage of end-of-the-year deals, buying directly from the companies. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own home and additionally to exhibit her products in a large retail center which would facilitate her business interactions. Her greatest challenge was during the process of adaptation when she arrived in Barranquilla. Her dream is that, along with her husband, she would obtain a quality education for her two children who are 7 and 18 years old, channeling for them a future full of successes and prosperity. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":622676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a large volume of cold meats such as stuffed turkeys and cold cuts along with delicious sauces\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-23T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leopoldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1030000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":67945},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":78460},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":79963},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81496},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83058},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84650},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86272},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87926},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89611},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91329},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93079},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":106211}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.26},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.09},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.93,"local_amount":67945,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":68574.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688408},{"amount":43.8,"local_amount":78460,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":79186.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289054},{"amount":44.64,"local_amount":79963,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80703.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230210},{"amount":448.63,"local_amount":803632,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":811077.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803032}],"funded_date":"2010-10-23T22:04:30Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":244775,"name":"Maria Lucrecia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Lucrecia tiene 65 a\u00f1os es casada y posee 6 hijos mayores de edad.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband Randolf G., who is 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 3 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nMarilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $250, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for the future and for the education of her children. Marilou G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is 24 years old. Gil is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Gil owns & operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing \"motorela\" or \"habal-habal\" (motorcycle transport) services to local community members. Gil has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gil joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gil has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase tools needed to provide service. Gil is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools needed to expand services provided. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Gil from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
