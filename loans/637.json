It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Faaiu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faaiu needs a loan of WST $1300 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faaiu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaiu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faaiu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He began working in a cement factory four years ago where he saw that selling cement was a good business and entrypoint. Currently, he buys and sells cement from the factory since they give him a lower price and he sells it for two bolivianos more. In this way he gains life to bring bread home every day.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Shine'.\r\n\r\nMaura is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Maura owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Maura has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maura joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maura is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This  will be the first loan taken out by Maura from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

What Lucinda most likes about her work is cultivating her land because she feels that she is putting it to good use.

Jorge is 27 years old.  He requests a loan to invest in his business selling eggs at wholesale and retail. He makes his sales from his house, and also in an itinerant manner.  He has had this business for 6 years.  Mariela is 28 years old and has a business selling handicrafts.  She buys her products in the market and sells from place to place.  She started up this business 2 years ago; her relatives helped her  by contributing the startup capital so that she could get the business going.  She also received help from other merchants who had experience in this line of work.  Ana Patricia has a business selling nacatamales (a traditional Nicaraguan tamal), beans and soup.  Her menu varies daily in order to accommodate the demands of her customers.  Her main challenge is to buy equipment for the business.  At this time, she does not have this equipment and so she uses utensils from her house.  She started this business with the help of her father, who set aside working capital so that she would be able to work and get ahead, since in this country it is difficult to find work.  Francisco has a business selling eggs from place to place, and also from his house.  He requests this new loan to invest in his business and stock it with more eggs; the loan will also allow him to make a big purchase and obtain a discount that he could not get if he buys the eggs at retail. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":895297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy eggs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2011-10-15T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco Filadelfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3083.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":3083.38,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3126.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244566394},{"amount":150.95,"local_amount":3384.9,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T08:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3431.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251670227},{"amount":138.63,"local_amount":3108.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3151.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257564003},{"amount":140.13,"local_amount":3142.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263322160},{"amount":142.27,"local_amount":3190.24,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3234.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270036421},{"amount":115.52,"local_amount":2590.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2626.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276648599}],"funded_date":"2011-10-21T21:11:48Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:39:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":350975,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 41 years old and is married to Michael.

H. is 40 years old. She is married and has five children who are currently in school. She has manufactured palm oil and palm kernel oil for six years now. Palm oil is produced from palm nuts, and palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel. These oils are used to prepare many local dishes. She produces the oils and supplies them to food vendors to prepare their meals. She normally switches her production between the two products. That is, after producing palm oil she automatically obtains the raw material to produce palm kernel oil. \r\n\r\nGeorgina will use the loan to buy more bags of palm nuts and an electric milling machine so she can produce the oils in larger quantities. She believes this increased production will augment her income so she can better provide for her family and finance her children\u2019s education. She belongs to the community group called \u201cTumi wura\u201d (Almighty) Trust Group. Her picture was taken at a group meeting.

They have four children.  The eldest child is 16-year-old Nicky, a first-year college student in a state university.  The next child is 14-year-old Riza, a second-year student in high school.  Riza is followed by 9-year-old Liezel, who is in fourth grade in elementary school. The family lives in a rural area of Sto. Tomas (part of Alicia, Isabela). They live in a small community with good road conditions.  By their house, a Catholic chapel is located where Rowena\u2019s family used to visit every Sunday for their spiritual growth.\r\n<p>\r\nRowena also maintains her village store business situated in front of their house.  She wants to improve more of her business.  Thus, Rowena is looking forward to borrowing a loan amounting to PHP 5,000 from the lending programs of ASKI.  Rowena will pay her loan on time so that she will be able to repeat the loan for her store working capital at present.  Also, in the coming days, Rowena wants to be able to increase her estimated monthly income of PHP 3,000 in the business.  Her estimated monthly income is not enough to sustain both her business and family\u2019s daily needs.  Also, her children\u2019s educational needs in the future will increase.\r\n<p>\r\nBut despite those hopes and dreams in life, Rowena believes that putting God first in everything you do is better than anything else for as said in the Bible, there is nothing impossible with Him.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":278530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She sells to the people of her locality, most of whom are food vendors. She says she desires to buy the goods in bulk so that she can reach a larger share of the market by trekking to markets in nearby towns. This she says is only possible by increasing her working capital. Basically, this is what she aspires to use the loan for.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting cocoa for sale.  Sisifo has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sisifo needs a loan of WST $2200 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sisifo joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sisifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sisifo F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

animal husbandry, principally rearing cows, goats and poultry.  She operates in Namulesa, Jinja.  She envisages a situation where her weekly profits of 180,000 shillings will be increased if she gets this loan.  She plans on buying more goats, cows and poultry to resell. She also intends to pay for the construction costs of a poultry house she is planning on building.  Anna, 50, a happily-married mother of four school-going children, says constant livestock and poultry diseases have often played havoc with her businesses. Anna was working as an accounts income tax clerk before she took root in this business.  Over the course of time in the future, she is planning on purchasing a Friesian cow that she hopes will produce enough milk for her to sell and get much more profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":593245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more goats, cows and poultry and pay for a poultry house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-09-04T06:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muzamiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khalid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaituni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":431250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":1725000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1730875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297302},{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":1725000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1730875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467576},{"amount":953.13,"local_amount":2156250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2163593.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605667},{"amount":571.87,"local_amount":1293750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1298156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744739}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T20:57:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erica  Gaetano","image":null}},{"id":232117,"name":"Marisol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marisol tiene 23 a\u00f1os, vive con su peque\u00f1a hija en casa de sus padres.

They have 3 children who are between 31 to 36 years old. \r\n\r\nMarilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29500, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials and stock her general store so that she can continue to save to repair her fish pond and operate that business. Marilyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives in the city of Camana, Peru, an oasis in the otherwise long and dry Sechura desert that dominates the coast in the southeast part of the country. Camana has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru; nevertheless, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the last decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroyed the tourist industry of Camana and cost many their jobs, means to make a living and homes. Camana has beautiful beaches that you only have to see to love and you would like to live there. Like Peru, it is well-known for its exquisite gastronomy and one of Luis' favorite dishes is the delicious \"Lomo Saltado\". Luis only completed fifth year of high school due to his parents' different economic problems, but he would have liked to go to culinary school since he loves to cook. He tells us that he likes to buy cook books to learn new recipes.\r\n\r\nLuis works in his business making and selling cakes. He gets up very early. From 3 in the morning he prepares his products because he says that God helps him in the morning. He works for approximately eight hours. In one day, he can earn up to S. 50 but on a good day he can earn up to S.80. He believes his business is going well because every day he works hard to make his products and because his customers are happy with his work.\r\n\r\nLuis is very thankful for the Kiva loans because with its great support he can buy more utensils for making his products. With this improvement he will be able to have more income which will permit him to continue saving so that in the future he can accomplish one of his great dreams: to buy a shop from which to sell his products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":978692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

They live in the zone with the same name, Gosalvez, in the village of Nuevo Potos\u00ed which is an area located on the western slope of the city of La Paz.  This hillside is characterized by having migrants from the high plains region.  In this zone they are generally dedicated to commerce, services and also to production, and most of the members work along these lines. <p>   \r\n\r\nThe communal bank GOSALVEZ has worked with our institution for five cycles, having funded itself on January 10, 2007.  Currently, the group consists of ten members with a management team as follows: <p>   \r\n\r\n- President Catalina L.\r\n- Treasurer Paulina M. Q.\r\n- Secretary Sofia V. A. <p>   \r\n\r\nIt must be highlighted that the group works with great solidarity, companionship and responsability; they learned how to save within the organization, given that in our country it is very difficult because of the social and economic situation we are going through.  The reasons that motivate them to work with this type of credit, as the women indicate, is that within the association they have a safe haven where they find motivation, fraternization, a space where they feel heard and can talk about their personal issues.  They later leave feeling renewed and able to again face all of their problems. <p>   \r\n\r\nCatalina L. Condori:  Has as her primary activity sales from a store that is located in her home.  She lives with her husband who earns his wages as a taxi driver.  Since their family does not count on a fixed income, they have turned to loans from the institution and one of this woman\u2019s dreams is to see her children become professionals.  One of them is in sergeant\u2019s school, and the other is still in secondary school. <p>   \r\n\r\nAgustina M. Q.: Has as her primary activity the sale of lubricants and production of blankets in her own home.  This woman, with effort and sacrifice, works together with her husband to support their four children.  Thanks to the loan granted by the institution, she has been able to buy equipment for making blankets and that way increase her working capital. <p>   \r\n\r\nGuillermo M. N.: Has his own business making footwear in his own home.  His wife has as her primary activity food sales in the zone of Chijini.  Despite the fact that they both work, their income wasn\u2019t enough to be able to save.  However, with the loan they were granted by the institution they were able to increase their capital and save for their children as they have hope to see them get ahead. <p>   \r\n\r\nPaulina M. Q.:  Mother of four children, she is an employee of a butcher\u2019s shop.  She earns a minimal wage which did not meet the family\u2019s financial needs, which is why she decided to join her husband in making footwear to offer for sale.  The loan granted by Emprender increased her working capital and, in turn, her production and income which simultaneously helped improve her economic situation. <p>   \r\n\r\nJuana Sabina T. N.:  Has as her principal activity the making and sale of jackets.  Despite the fact that she is still a single young woman, she is in charge of caring for her parents and brothers and therefore finds herself as the head of household.  Thanks to the loan granted her, she has managed to produce jackets for both men and women of different sizes.  Before, she was lacking in raw materials which was a difficulty.  One of her dreams is to one day have her own store and to be able to export her designs. <p>   \r\n\r\nSofia V. A.:  Has as her principal activity the sale of undergarments and socks.  Given that she does not count on a fixed wage, her income was not sufficient.  She sought a loan to help her to increase and diversify her products.  Her principal objective is to be able to save so she can buy her own plot of land. <p>   \r\n\r\nDominga N. A.:  Dedicates herself to the sale of aprons, and finds herself in charge of supporting her five children.  The only income with which the family can count on is hers, since the children are still in school.  With the loan granted her, it has become a possibility that this woman might be able to buy her own stand and a stock of merchandise. <p>   \r\n\r\nTeodora Q. Cayo:  Has as her activity the fabrication and sale of footwear, and she also cares for her six children given that the father is in a rural area.  It is for this reason that she assumed the expenses and responsibilities of the home.  Her dream is to be able to have a store and increase her capital, in order to produce her shoes for men, women and children. <p>   \r\n\r\nFlora R. M.:  This woman has as her principal activity the sale of fruit.  She has a large family, and their income is dependent on her.  With the loan from the institution she has managed to increase her capital, and in that way purchase more seasonal products and improve the financial situation for herself and her children. <p>   \r\n\r\nIrene C. M.:  This woman works tending to a public restroom, and her husband earns his wages as a chauffer.  The family\u2019s income is minimal, and does not cover their basic needs.  With her loan, she has managed to purchase gifts which she sells in various locales close to her work and in this way try to improve their very difficult economic situation.  <p>   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":208729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2008-10-08T13:20:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sof\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T18:15:22Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":383.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312476},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9929701},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-07T09:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15639511},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-19T08:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393510},{"amount":383.33,"local_amount":2666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085305},{"amount":383.35,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2677.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978802}],"funded_date":"2008-10-08T18:15:22Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:24:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":71505,"name":"Pen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pen P. lives in Pour Roung Village in Takeo Province.

The official name of this borrowing group is Amy E.'s Group.\n\nAmy is married and has three school-aged children.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\n\nAmy is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.

The official name of this borrowing group is Jeralyn I. group.\r\n\r\nJeralyn is single and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Jeralyn owns and operates a clothing business.

Jeralyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Jeralyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Jeralyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It is located in Piura region, more than four hours from the city of Chiclayo, capital of Lambayeque province.\r\n\r\nEva sells school supplies and writing supplies from a small store in her home.  Her main customers are students from the area who always come to her establishment because she is able to supply them with items that they need and which they would otherwise have to go to the central town to acquire.\r\n\r\nEva's business is an important source of income for her family since, thanks to it, she is able to help her husband, who is a master baker, to cover their family's expenses.  For this reason, she tries to maintain her business as well as possible.

She has a store in Le\u00f3n central market where she has been selling her products for more than 18 years.  She used to sell clothes as an itinerant vendor in the neighborhoods of the city of Le\u00f3n.  However, with the help of her deceased husband and loans that she took out, she managed to set up her store in the market.  She also traveled to Honduras so that she could buy clothes to sell in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nOver time, Juana's business prospered.  She set up a small grocery store and has been making repairs to her home.

He has been working in agriculture his entire life after being taught by his father. He has four children, only one of which is still in school. His other three children live and work with him on his farm and help him produce rice. He wants to improve his home, because it is made only out of wood at the moment. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. The loans will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season.

Married and the mother of three children, she has been selling eggs in Gbadago for the last six years knowing that the income of her retired husband isn't enough for the needs of their household. Even though she has a good command of her trade, she sometimes has difficulties making purchases. She would therefore like to have a 600 dollar loan to stock eggs to better satisfy her clients. Financial support of this project will increase her income in order to contribute to her household's needs. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMme A.

She has worked as a high school teacher for the past twenty years.  Paula is 49 years old.  She lives in Omar Trujillo, which is the capital of Nicaragua, Managua.  She lives there with her three children who are 19, 25 and 28 years old.  Two of her children have jobs and one is in college.  Her plans are to be able to buy a car, since it has been one of her dreams for many years now.  She has been  commuting to and from work on a bus that is always completely full and very uncomfortable.  For that reason she has been saving money and with the help of Afodenic she will be able to fulfill her dreams.  This will allow her to be able to purchase a care to drive to and from work and to be able to enjoy with her family a pleasant commute.  Her goal is to help her daughter to finish her university education and to become a professional.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Ashlee and Katey of San Roque High School)<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She sells her traditional D\u00e8gu\u00e8 cream at the big market of Sikasso to a clientele composed of women, mostly fair-goers.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to earn a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA, which will be used to cover the bulk of the family expenses and to pay the interest on the loan, any remainder to be invested in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French

As a mother of 5 children, her small vending business allows her to support her family's income, by adding to the income from her long term partner. With this particular loan, Ruth is looking forward to the possibility of acquiring more inventory such as cosmetics and beauty products. The earnings from her business will allow her to continue to support her children and put her one step closer to her dream, which is to run an ice cream store.\r\n\r\nRuth is just one member of the 10 person group, La Alternativa 1 & 3. Together, these Dominican entrepreneurs are able to unite in solidarity, allowing them access to funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own. The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the other members gladly help cover one another\u2019s payments in order to receive their next loan together.\r\n\r\nRuth has been an Esperanza associate for 5 years. This is her 11th loan. All her previous loans have been paid and invested in her business. Her story is representative of this group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in Saman\u00e1, a lush rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":691918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy cosmetic products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Saman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2011-01-13T21:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wandy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":122000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":10048.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9422.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":9598.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9777.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":9960.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":10146.11},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":10335.53},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10528.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10724.96},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":10925.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":11129.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":9403.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":257.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.47},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":277.45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":784.02,"local_amount":29206.16,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":29283.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414336},{"amount":526.61,"local_amount":19617.06,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":19668.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991217},{"amount":549.83,"local_amount":20482.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":20536.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275290},{"amount":570.55,"local_amount":21253.99,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":21309.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142549},{"amount":843.99,"local_amount":31440.66,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":31523.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215545}],"funded_date":"2011-01-17T02:36:20Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":269031,"name":"Theodosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theodosie is 30 years old, married and has two children who are three and five.

She is married to Renato, her business partner, and she is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nSevilla operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 10,000. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nSevilla dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

and Yombo S.. They have called their group \"Atamu\". They have received several loans through SMT. They have re-paid previous loans successfully. They each received Le 1,000,000 in their previous loan. That loan helped them a lot. They were able to make a lot of profit from the loan, and thus were able to solve many of their problems. Today, they are requesting a new loan for the same amount of Le 1,000,000 each to add to their businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nKadiatu (left) is the leader of this group. Kadiatu was born in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. She is forty-three years of age, married with five children \u2013 one in college, one in secondary school, one in primary school, one in nursery school and the last is not yet of school age. Her husband is a businessman, too. <P>\r\n\r\nKadiatu sells groundnuts (peanuts).  She has been in this business for 20 years now. With this loan of Le 1,000,000, Kadiatu will buy about five bags of groundnuts to add to her business. She travels to the village of Bamoi to buy the groundnuts. The fare to Bamoi is Le 15,000 and she pays a Le 6,000 delivery fee for each bag of groundnuts. A bag of groundnuts costs Le 200,000.   \r\n\r\nSo far, Kadiatu faces no major challenge worth noting in her business. Her only challenge in life is taking good care of her children. She wants the best education for her children. With her business, she wants to make more profit so that she will be able to build a house for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":239805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying groundnuts to re-sell in the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabenty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maseray","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yombo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":7000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":235},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":235}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885074},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434523},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128916},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025705},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611608},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008509},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1400000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1411410,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230850},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102855},{"amount":235,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":705705,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019876}],"funded_date":"2009-01-02T08:01:28Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:02:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83825,"name":"Arafaat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arafaat is a 44-year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with his wife and their three children.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in the Pelengana Nord district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Not having attended school for societal reasons, she very early on started in commerce with her sister-in-law, who used to sell condiments at the grand marketplace of Pelenegana.  After several years with her, and rich with this experience, Ms. D. developed on her own for 15 years in the commerce of peanut butter and tamarind (an exotic fruit highly prized in Africa).  She frequently receives orders from Bamako or from certain civil servants in S\u00e9gou. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make her peanut butter, she first starts with threshing, and next she proceeds to shelling, winnowing, and roasting.  Finally she goes to grind the roasted nuts at the mill in order process them into paste.  After this phase, she puts the paste into 5-kg and 10-kg pails ready now for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nWith plans to augment her working capital, she turned to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, which she has had an association with for 4 years.  After 4 solidarity loans and 2 individual loans, all repaid, she is on now on her third individual loan. She hopes to use this loan to buy 40 sacks of peanuts.  She supplies herself essentially from Yangasso from rural producers.  Sales are made to customers composed of men and women, cash or credit accepted. \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to realize a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA that will enable her to cover some family expenses (clothing, participation in social events).

With experience gained over time in the purchase and sale of cattle he has been able to bring stability to his family. The desire that Mustafokul harbors in his heart is that of increasing his capital to invest in acquiring more animals. He requests $700 USD to buy more cattle to expand his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After that, a big frying pan containing oil is set on the stove and the dough is spooned out into the pan. In three minutes, the frying is finished, the beignets are removed, and the process  begins again. \r\n\r\nIn order to continue with this work, Mrs. Ass\u00e9tou C. plans to use her loan to purchase 500 kg [1100 lbs] of pearl millet, 10 liters [2.6 gallons] of cooking oil, 1 kg [2.2 lbs] of leavening, 10 kg [22 lbs] of salt and 20 kg [44 lbs] of sugar.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

has a rice peeling operation in Salitre. She hopes to invest the loan in buying rice from the local farmers so she can sell it to distributors. She has three children, two males and a female. She lives in her home with two of her kids who are still in school. She hopes that she can save enough money to send her kids to school in Guayaquil. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy rice wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T20:44:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-29T19:58:53Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:14:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29279},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T22:55:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40767},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:12:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53284},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T20:12:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89185},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99040}],"funded_date":"2007-05-15T19:58:53Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:50:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14185,"name":"Marhamathon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marhamathon is 58 years old.
