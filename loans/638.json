Renilda F., or Taring as she is called by her friends, makes sure she plans well so as to have a good future ahead of her. Still single at 26 years of age, Taring runs her own business as she receives continuous entrepreneurial training from CCT as a community partner. Taring finished high school and presently resides in Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nTaring owns a sari-sari (variety) store near her home. On a daily basis, she competes with other sari-sari stores in the community and makes sure her regular customers will keep buying goods from her while she continues attracting other neighbors to buy from her store. Taring has been in this business for five years now. She earns around 10,700 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Taring needs a loan amount of 10,000 PHP.  She will use this loan to purchase quality products which her customers are looking for. She makes sure that her store shelves will not lack any essential product which her neighbors need, and so she plans to buy more canned goods, soft drinks, and other grocery items. Taring believes that this loan will raise her sari-sari store above her competitors.\r\n\r\nCompetition is something one cannot and should not avoid. Making the most out of it, Taring is using competition to push her business to grow.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in a mountainous location, where raising livestock is the residents' primary type of business.  Mahmud currently has a cow and ten sheep.

Compared to buying water households safe 132 USD per year using Nazava water filters, which enable them to purify rain, well or river water and make it safe to drink. \nTo respond to the high demand for Nazava water filters in her district, Salma would like to purchase bigger stock at reduced costs. She has already established a network of 5 sub-resellers that can directly sell the filters to their customers.\n\n \u201cI currently have the cash for just 25 filters, that\u2019s why I run out of stock easily, which is bad for my business. Transport costs are also relatively high when ordering just a few filters. \u201c\nWith a 2000 USD loan, Ibu Salma can provide safe drinking water to 1000 people in just 1 month.

Daajinsuren sells children\u2019s clothing. In 2007 she and her two daughters moved to the city from the countryside and began to sell children\u2019s clothing at the outdoor market.  In 2009 she moved to a different market, leased a booth and started working there.  Her older daughter helps her at the market even though she is in school.   She also takes care of her little sister when Daajinsuren is away.  They hope someday to be able to lease another booth to expand their business.\r\n\r\nWith money from the loan she would like to buy clothes in Beijing and bring them to Mongolia to sell.  If she can get a better selection and better quality clothes from Beijing she can gain more customers and increase her income.\r\n\r\nShe lives with her two daughters in a Mongolian Ger.  Her husband got sick and passed away four years ago.  The property they live on has a shack on it but it is so old and run down that they can\u2019t live in it.  She hopes to be able to save enough money to fix up that shack and move into it before winter sets in.\r\n\r\nDaajinsuren is very quiet, unassuming, and a very hard worker.

(ASHI), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with high hopes and aspirations to have access to capital for her business. Her previous loans were used as rolling capital for her fishing business and also, partly, as capital for her secondary sewing business. She is hopeful that with hard work and proper use of capital, she can make her business grow. She dreams of having more fish cages and her own sewing machine. She also wants to be able to improve her house into one more spacious and durable."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":368620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Burigul has had a trying life but still maintains an optimistic outlook.  She is a widow with three children. When her husband passed away, she was left without a steady income. Supporting her large family on her own is very difficult. She nonetheless remains a strong and persevering person and is intent on improving her family\u2019s standard of living. She dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle.  The income she generates provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends.

She and her husband live in their own home.  During the day, Mariela works for a well-known institution in the area.  After that she works selling clothes and shoes.  When she has orders from her customers or from people that she knows, she lets them buy on credit and make payments to her.  When the payment date arrives, she goes to their houses or workplaces to collect her money.  She got the idea to start this business five years ago, when she wanted to increase her home\u2019s income.  What she likes most about her job is getting to know many people and her client base is increasing.  It is profitable for her because she only sells by the order, so she doesn\u2019t waste money on merchandise that will not sell.  In the future, Mariela would like to have a store that sells clothing and high-quality shoes.  This is her 3rd loan with MFP and she enjoys working with her community bank because all of the members are very organized.  With the loan money she will by clothes and shoes to fill the orders that she has right now.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":299328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-07T21:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":126.54},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":136.48},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141.95},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":146.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":152.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":160.26},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":165.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":170.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.49},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.32},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.87},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":126.54,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":131.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012400},{"amount":45.49,"local_amount":136.48,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":141.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595988},{"amount":47.32,"local_amount":141.95,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":147.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990252},{"amount":48.85,"local_amount":146.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":151.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211376},{"amount":50.87,"local_amount":152.6,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":158.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640884},{"amount":53.42,"local_amount":160.26,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":166.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080353},{"amount":55.03,"local_amount":165.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":171.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996551},{"amount":56.84,"local_amount":170.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":176.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842047}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T16:29:14Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":103965,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana T., a 33-year-old trader who belongs to a village bank called \u2018wonderful Jesus,\u2019 is the mother of five children, four of whom are currently attending school through the help of government free compulsory education.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

On this plantation, she faces a problE. because her field has infertile soil which it is bad enough to affect her crop production. In order to solve this problE., she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field to make the crop more productive.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nary K. is 38 years old and the mother of two children who are attending the local school. Her husband, Mr. Theng Khan, is a construction foreman.\r\n\r\nNine members in this group loans have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those with EoT loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. EoT loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow thE. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Raul is a security guard. They have three children, ages 15, 9 and 5, all of whom are in school, and the oldest one helps out by doing some chores around the house. Their biggest wish is to have the necessary resources to be able to professionally educate their children and for the entire family to live in a more comfortable and safe environment. In order to reach this dream they have requested the loan with the intention of making improvements to their home's infrastructure. With the loan they will take the first step of purchasing materials such as cement, sand and lime to put a fine plaster on the walls of their home.

Married to Angel C., a carpenter, they are blessed with nine children.  She earns money so their family can have a better life.  Rosita has two businesses: she has made curtains for 10 years and has operated a food cart as a vendor for more than three years.\r\n\r\nRosita is a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT).  She attends their weekly meetings and pays her dues consistently.  Because of her good repayment performance, she was able to borrow a sixth time from CCT.  The reason she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used almost all the money she borrowed to buy Filipino finger foods to resell.

Some do their activities in their own homes, while others are traveling merchants.\n\nAs far as competition goes, we can mention that their competitors are present in the neighborhood.  The members have their loyal customers who constantly generate the economic movement that is necessary to support themselves.  In case it is not going well in the neighborhood, they go to other locations like fairs and neighborhood markets so they can meet their own obligations and those of their families.\n\nThe loan is to stock their stores buy purchasing merchandise, work material, and supplies in greater quantities.  Then they will be able to generate better earnings that will allow them to give their families a better quality of life.  As far as experience goes, the members are completing their second cycle.  They demonstrate responsibility, honesty, and the desire to get ahead to improve their businesses.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use this loan to purchase a personal computer for her younger son to use in school.\r\n\r\nSaltanat\u2019s longer term plans are to increase the number of cattle on her farm and to contribute money to her elder son\u2019s wedding.\r\n\r\nSaltanat has three partners:\r\n\r\nBaktygul A., 42, is the treasurer of the group. She is also in the business of purchasing cattle and reselling them after fattening. She has been doing this for three years, ever since she divorced and her friends suggested she start this business. She began with a 10,000 KGS investment and today makes a 4,000 KGS monthly profit. With the loan, Baktygul wants to purchase four cows to increase her turnover.\r\n\r\nFarhat A. is an impressive 22-year old. He successfully graduated from second year at the university and, in order to do this, had to take out a loan. To pay off his loan he began selling cattle, fish, and agricultural products. He started this business one year ago with 5,000 KGS and now makes a 4,000 KGS profit. He would like another loan to buy more cattle and increase the amount of his herd. His future plans are to graduate, to marry, and to find a good job.\r\n\r\nSabira B., 69, wants to have enough money to support her daughter and grandchildren. Her daughter is 25 and works in a nursery, earning 5,000 KGS per month. Sabira looks after her grandchildren and breeds cattle. She is a widow and, following her neighbors\u2019 advice, began to breed cattle with an initial investment of 10,000 KGS. Now she makes 1,500 KGS per month. She would like to use the loan to purchase hay for her cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

All of them strive day to day to get ahead in their businesses.  To prosper is one of the objectives that they have.\r\n\r\nThat is the case with Epifania, a very hard-working woman.  Upon separating from her husband she started to work selling food from a cart close to her house.  It was her mother-in-law who urged her to do this.  She is also a small businesswoman.  \r\n\r\nNine years ago she started selling prickly pears (fruit of the mountain range).  She extracts the cochineal insect, a parasite that is often used to give color to clothing fabrics, from the pulpy part.  She sold this fruit by going door to door and at the markets.  She also worked as a domestic employee, which she says she has done since she was very young. \r\n\r\nWith the first loan that she received she bought supplies to make \u201ccachangas\u201d (a type of bread maD. from wheat flour), coffee, and fried chicken.  In time she was attracting customers.  That is how she has increased her capital.  Now, because of the good seasoning that her food has, she has been hired to cook for special events like birthdays and anniversaries.\r\n\r\nThis business has gone well for her.  With her income from these sales she knew to give her children an education.  At the same time she built a house on land that she inherited from her deceased parents.\r\n\r\nHer children are professionals.  Her last son is 14 years old, and he is still in school.\r\n\r\nShe needs to invest in supplies to continue selling kebobs, fried fish, and cachangas.  The anniversary of the country of Peru is near, and there will be lots of tourists in the area.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":577506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies: chicken, fish, and beef heart to make her kebobs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-03T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Rufino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuliana Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niria Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariluz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Del Milagro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1380},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1380}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831584},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098125},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390794},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529074},{"amount":490,"local_amount":1380,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665193}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T21:10:31Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":223629,"name":"Patricie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patricie is 42 years old; she has 5 children aged 14-23 years.

is a 28-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a general store and a fishing business. She lives in the municipality of Medellin, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her general store and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000.  Alicia is borrowing PHP 24,000 to purchase more products and a new engine for her fishing boat.  This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Alicia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

is a native of Colpar, an annex in the Quilcas District in Huancayo.

He has been doing this kind of work for a very long time for he comes from a family with an entirely agricultural background, and now he is in charge of handing down all that experience to his children. His immense wishes for self-improvement, despite having encountered terrible times of crisis due to inclement winter weather that struck his growing fields on more than one occasion, have led him to choose to intensify his means of making a living.

The members travel around constantly selling their merchandise as their biggest markets are found in areas a long way from the city.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this new loan is to obtain more items such as material, building supplies, and clothing so the members can sell in distant areas and earn more money to provide their families with a better quality of life. There is a lot of competition in the central markets so the members are forced to take their products to more distant areas, seeking markets where there is not so much competition.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and ready-to-wear clothing businesses. Jije Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jije Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14000, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to purchase more fishing nets and ready-to-wear inventory so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and house repair. Jije Grace is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store\/spices business and a fish vending business.  Her husband Richard, who is 40 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 13 to 18 years old.  Chayrell joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chayrell has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Chayrell is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since she didn't get the chance to attend school for social reasons, she started to work and make money early on. She decided to sell \"bazin\" cloth (highly prized cloth in Western Africa). With this loan, she will buy 15 pieces of withe \"bazin\" from merchants in the grand market of Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). She then contracts dyers in Bougouni to tint the fabrics in various prized colors or patterns, as requested by her clientele. She then sells the fabrics door-to-door in various neighborhoods in the city, to a mostly female clientele. Furthermore, she also sells in the neighboring cities, most notably in Kolondieba and Yonfolila. With this loan, she foresees to make a profit of XOF 30'000 (ca 60 US$), to be mainly used to increase her working capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

Juana says that plowing the land is an art. Since she was a child, she has done agricultural work. She used to wake up at 4:00 am to help her mother prepare lunch, and now she does the same thing, but this time it is for her husband and children. This family sows 5 to 7 hectares of carrots and lettuce every year and then they buy plots sown with lettuce and spinach from the neighbors to take them to the markets. In each trip to the market, they earn 200 to 300 soles, depending on how they price their products. Juana is very pleased with their crops and the resale of the products, because of the rewarding earnings that she gets every time she goes to the market. The vegetables don\u2019t have a standard price. There are times, like in the summer, when the lettuce and the carrots cost as much as 50 soles per sack, but at times, the prices are as low as 20 to 25 soles per sack. Juana has worked with MFP for five consecutive loans. As such, she will repay this sixth loan with the same punctuality. With the money she is requesting, she will buy fertilizers for the cultivation of her next plots of carrots, and she is also very grateful for MFP because of the money that they loan her. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":254810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers for her plots","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T09:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996396}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:24:21Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":87613,"name":"Elisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elisa is a village store owner who has been managing her business for almost a year and it really helps her in meeting the needs of her children.

After fattening them, she sells at the best price and makes her profit. In the future, she wants to start another business. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime she will continue dedicating herself to cattle-raising. Right now she wishes to expand her business and purchase more cattle. That is the reason that Bahriniso has asked for a loan of $1200 USD. You could become an important part of Bahriniso family's life. She deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Alicia sells canned fish at wholesale.  Her relatives who live in Tiquina (neal Lake Titicaca) are her suppliers; they are fishermen.  \r\n\r\nHer typical routine is a follows:  On Mondays, she rises at 4am to travel to Tiquina to buy fish.  Because she buys from her relatives, the price she gets is lower.  She returns in the afternoon and sells most of her product on Juan Pablo II avenue (cross street: Los Andes) to her customers who then resell it at retail.  During the week, from Tuesday to Thursday she rises at 5am in order to be in the city of El Alto by 7:30 to collect on her sales.  She has recently increased her sales because she brings between 2 and 3 additional cans of pejerrey (silverside fish), which is the product that sells the most.  She also has a part-time job in the afternoon  as a domestic employee in a home in Calacoto; she gets a monthly salary of 600 bolivianos for this work.  She takes advantage of the fact that her husband, Ramiro, works as a bricklayer in front of their house and he watches over their two children who are not in school yet.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

is 30 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Arkhangai province in central Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Her elder daughter, Zolzaya, who is 8 years old, currently attends a local secondary school while her younger child, Zolbayar, who is 6 years old, is in kindergarten. Altantsetseg operates a dairy trading business with the help of her husband in her town. She started her business in 2007 with working capital of 100,000 tugrugs (~70 USD) and has built a stable operation over the years. Today, she is well established in the local business community and attributes her success to her strong customer base, communication skills and good accounting practices. Altantsetseg also has many reliable suppliers, many of which sell exclusively to her. Today, her working capital exceeds 400,000 tugrugs (~280 USD). For the future, Altantsetseg hopes to own her own workspace, which will allow her to serve more customers. She is requesting a 400,000 tugrug loan to purchase more dairy products for her

Misamis Occidental. Rosita is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rosita N.\u2019s Group.\r\n\t\r\nRosita is married to Bonifacio N., a fisherman, and they are blessed with 6 children, 4 of whom are adults and the other 2 are of school age. To help her husband in supporting their family, she decided to engage in a little business operating a sari-sari (variety) store. For 10 years now she has been able to manage this little business and she is now earning an average net income of not less than PHP 4,000 a month, which is so helpful to their family's income.\r\n\r\nShe joined the cooperative in 2009.  As an active member and at the same time the center chief of the Jakarta center of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting an amount of PHP 6,500 as her second loan for the purpose of adding to her capital for her existing business activity, which is a sari-sari (variety) store business.\r\n\r\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family, to meet their basic needs and for savings for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

These hardworking entrepreneurs are involved in various revenue-generating activities, including clothing sales, manicure\/pedicure services, sewing\/alteration services, and catalog sales. In general, this loan will be used by each individual member to make investments in her specific business activity. Vendors of catalog items will invest in merchandise such as clothing, DVDs, pots, pans, perfumes, and jewelry. Seamstresses will purchase fabric, thread, and needles in order to produce clothing for sale. Some members will use this loan to invest in nail polish and other tools necessary for providing manicure and pedicure services. The members of this group offer their products and services to clients in their immediate community as well as to people in neighboring communities. \r\n\r\nThe loan consultant who has been working with these women describes them as a tight-knit group with much experience in their individual businesses and the mutual goal of attaining a higher standard of living within their communities and families. The name of this group comes from the Bible. To the members of the group, Arab refers to growth and expansion, both of which are central values for this group. \r\n\r\nEmma Q. Cevrato is a 35-year-old mother of four who lives with her family in Pococ\u00ed. She is also the elected president of this group. Emma is involved in two types of business: sewing\/alteration services and the sale of brand-name clothing. She says the secret to organizing her day in a productive manner is keeping to a schedule. She designates blocks of time to take care of domestic tasks and blocks of time to her business. When she is very busy, her children assist her by tending to the sales part of the business while their mother sews in her workshop. Emma's goals are to expand her business and grow her list of clients. Her dream is to own a business separate from her home. With respect to her family, the immediate goal is to establish economic stability.
