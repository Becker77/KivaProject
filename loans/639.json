Serkerdar  is 43 years old and married with three children. He is a farmer by trade, but is currently a refugee from the Azerbaijan-Armenian conflict territory in the Khojavand region of eastern Azerbaijan. Right now, he and his family live in Baku. He started his meat business in 1997, when he purchased one sheep with money he had saved up. The work is interesting, but time-consuming and takes a lot of effort. At the same time, the salary he earns is not enough to cover all of his family's expenses. Serkerdar would therefore like to borrow $500 to buy 7 small sheep plus some food for them. He will repay the loan within 12 months and hopes that it will expand his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":67463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy 7 sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Baku","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.395278 49.882222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":31,"posted_date":"2007-09-22T13:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serkardar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-07T01:35:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-11-07T10:22:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":77909},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T10:23:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93107},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111062},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130309},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151965},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-04-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":176063},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203361},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230593},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T06:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259702},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T06:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288499},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318798},{"amount":38,"local_amount":38,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-19T08:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350697}],"funded_date":"2007-09-23T01:35:26Z","paid_date":"2008-11-19T08:09:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22866,"name":"De Las Nieves","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p> Senora De las Nievas A. de Caballero is married and has one son.

Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low income. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through <i><b>Micro Leasing<\/b><\/i> as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA buys equipment and leases it to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from her, extending her a loan, and then leases the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called \"sale and leaseback\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":113280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional stock in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-12T04:25:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-26T06:56:56Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-02-26T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":142751},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166733},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192526},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":220221},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249392},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":34137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278054}],"funded_date":"2008-01-12T06:56:56Z","paid_date":"2008-07-26T09:13:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35154,"name":"Mugunza A(Iii) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group leader of this small group is Hamida H..

In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rosa works in used clothing sales, which she began 3 years ago. She was having many difficulties and decided to do something to improve her family's situation, and began purchasing used clothes because her income was not sufficient to maintain her home. She began to sell these clothes in the streets. Unfortunately, sometimes she was not able to sell much, but she was not defeated. She began to offer the clothes to her neighbors as well. For this reason she is requesting a loan for the capital to buy pajamas, children's clothes, and women's clothes, which will allow her to diversify her products and generate more income.

Her husband, Rogelio, is 39 and is a vendor and her business partner.\r\n\r\nLife was not easy for Marita. She was challenged by the miserable condition of their lives to strive hard and search for a greener living. In 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with the hope of bringing light to her family. On her previous loans, she prudently invested those in doormat making. But it is quite laborious and time consuming.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Marita opted to venture in fish-ball vending which is in demand by kids and also by the people in the community, especially during the afternoon. She observed that fish-ball vending is more profitable, and so she considered it as their primary business.\r\n\r\nNow, Marita has applied for a loan of 30,000 pesos as additional capital for her business, to improve her cart and some will go to her secondary business of doormat making.\r\n\r\nMarita is positive and hopeful that, if coupled with industry, their business will bring them great profit so that they can save and be able to send their children to school, enabling them to find jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":359530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Food Vending businesses. Her husband Roberto E., who is 34 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 3 to 8 years old. \r\n\r\nVelenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Velenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for home repairs. \r\n\r\nVelenda E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Su principal objetivo es el establecimiento de una sucursal en la ciudad de Cochabamba donde existe un importante mercado por las condiciones clim\u00e1ticas y el acceso a la materia prima.\r\n\r\n<p>Por el momento, Julia necesita de capital para poder abastecerse de materia prima procedente de Cochabamba, para preparar la venta de sus helados en los desfiles y concentraciones a ra\u00edz de la proximidad de las fiestas patrias."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":50506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Julia needs capital in order to supply herself with the ingredients she needs to make her ice creams.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2007-07-24T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-08T16:02:19Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-09-08T09:22:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-09T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52233},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-10-08T09:24:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-09T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64832},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-11-08T10:28:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-09T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78446},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T10:29:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-09T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93697},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-09T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111977},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-02-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-09T10:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":131227}],"funded_date":"2007-07-25T16:02:19Z","paid_date":"2008-02-08T10:24:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18785,"name":"Farkhad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farkhad lives in the Yenikand village of the Salyan region.

This is 49 year-old Asinati Shemahombe.  She is married, and has six children aged between 15 and 25. She has three dependents, who live with her because they are orphans.  In 2003, Asinati established her caf\u00e9 business. Asinati requires a loan in order to purchase additional ingredients, such as rice, beans, cooking oil and sugar, as well as utensils. She thanks you for your support. <P>When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":168231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase additional ingredients, such as rice, beans, cooking oil and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-06-07T06:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asnati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-21T13:08:58Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273527},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":101575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302966},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":101575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":333784},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-24T07:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368036},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":101575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347761}],"funded_date":"2008-06-07T13:08:58Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T03:26:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":55654,"name":"Fatou","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"<p>Fatou S. is 51 years old, married with 7 children in her care, and has been a member of the village bank of Peyrissac since 2001.

Sequeiro, 31, lives with his wife and two small daughters in a community named El Sa\u00edno de Pital.  It is located in the Alajuela province.  The main productive activities are livestock and agriculture.  Growing pineapple stands out because it is primarily sold in international markets.  For that reason, the development of the community has been growing in the last few years.  This generates a larger demand for products and services, which helps to mitigate the effect of immigration.\r\n\r\nFernando has devoted himself to growing pineapples since he was very young.  He, therefore, has considerable experience in the care and maintenance of this type of crop.  He has a small piece of land where he has previously grown pineapple.  It gave him good results at distribution time.  That is why he wishes to expand his fields.  Thanks to this business, his family\u2019s quality of life has improved considerably.\r\n\r\nFernando is asking for a loan for \u00a2400,000 (four hundred thousand colones) for maintenance and assistance in his fields.  He will also buy necessary supplies to guarantee a very good harvest.\r\n\r\nFernando is a member of the Luz del Futuro Saino Community Credit Company, one of the 100 organizations partnered with EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his third loan, and he expects to grow more on a personal and economic level.  Thanks to this type of organization and their means for facilitating loans, he can spend more time on his productive activities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":370389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Buy supplies and maintenance for planting pineapples","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":409919.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195827342}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T16:18:51Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":133532,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda es soltera, tiene 51 a\u00f1os, con 5 hijos,  todos casados y con ingresos propios.\nLa despensa mont\u00f3 gracias a un peque\u00f1o capital que hab\u00eda  ahorrado durante varios a\u00f1os.

Her husband is a civil servant in Lagos. She sells drinks both wholesale and retail.

He lives with his wife and their two children, ages 2 and 12.  They live in the Malambo municipality, which is 15 minutes from the city of Barranquilla.  He has a business selling varied merchandise there.  He takes advantage of the opportunity to generate other income by selling minutes and recharges for cell phones.\r\n\r\nEdwin ventured in the business activity three years ago as a third party debt collector.  With his savings he managed to undertake his convenience store in his mother\u2019s house.  He sells various items like perfume, cleaning products, and general stationery items.  Previously he worked with electronics, but it did not go very well for him because people do not know about electronics.  Everything stopped very quickly.\r\n\r\nThat is why he looked for another business activity that would generate income for him.  Once he undertook his store, he also got three cell phone plans to sell minutes.  He also makes home deliveries of medications, and  does independent invoice collection.  These activities allow him to get complementary income in addition to what he gets from his store.\r\n\r\nHe was recommended to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo a year ago.  He got his first loan from them, and he got three display cases that he stocked with the same loan.  This is his second loan, and he hopes to increase his sales by 35%.  He will buy school supplies because it is the season for school to start.  There is an important school very close to his business, and that is the most secure part of his market.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to increase his customers, and, like all good fathers, give his children a quality education.  He dreams of one day seeing them become successful

To make a living, Angelita owns & operates a business raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Angelita has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when she sells one of the raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Angelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more breeding livestock. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Concepcion, a town in the \"departamento\" of La Paz.  She started working very young because she had to help her mother with various businesses: first, food sales and, later, sales of lottery tickets.  Dona Dalia now makes a living selling cosmetics door to door.  Her life isn't easy, partly because her children are in school and her former husband barely helps with school fees and other expenses, and partly because she sells on credit and her customers don't always pay on time.  She will use this loan to buy shampoos, deodorants, perfumes, combs, creams, soaps, nail varnish, eye shadow, lipsticks and other inventory.  The loan will help her stock her business so that she can provide a wider range of products to her customers.  Her biggest challenge is the distances she has to travel to sell her products.  Her goals are to see her children finish school and to be an authorized cosmetics distributor in her neighborhood.  Her fellow group members, Francisca and Adela, operate retail businesses, selling snacks and dairy products.  This is the group's first round of funding and they expect to repay their loans in the agreed-upon time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":848081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock her retail business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Paz, La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalia Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3250},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3284.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307959},{"amount":175,"local_amount":3250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3284.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589338},{"amount":350,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6569.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547432}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T13:58:50Z","paid_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":331043,"name":"Safarali","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0421\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440\u044b. \u0415\u043c\u0443 38 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 10 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u044b\u043d\u0438, \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0437\u0430, \u044f\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a, \u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0438 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0436\u0438\u0440\u0430.","en":"Safarali lives in the Dangara district.

He lives in a rented room with his wife, and both of them want to move forward. Having spent his childhood on his native Amantani Island (Lake Titicaca), Alfonso knows that produce there is frequently in short supply. He has been in the business of selling farm produce for 10 years now and sails across Titicaca every week with his goods. He not only takes over the produce he has harvested, but also stocks the inhabitants of the island with everything they might need (supplies, furniture, groceries, etc.). His is a very profitable trade, as he is the only person doing this job. It makes Alfonso happy to know that the people of Amantani want for nothing thanks to his efforts, but transporting all of these goods is the hardest aspect of his work.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":475179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

She is 47 years old and the leader of a 12-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJocelyne is married and has two school-aged children. She makes a living from her business selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste. She has had her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Jocelyne joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyne has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Jocelyne is requesting a new loan of 23000 PHP which will also be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the eleventh loan taken out by Jocelyne from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also engages in agriculture, taking care of her lands where she plants potatoes, maize, peas and broad beans. Sometimes her son helps her taking care of her animals while she sells beer. She says this activity helps her facing her financial problems, as it generates enough income to get by until the harvesting season, and for this reason she wants to increase her working capital.

He sells different cosmetics products such as mascara, eyeliner, lipstick and nail polish.\r\n\r\nAmna has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to financially assist her husband in his business. With a loan, he will buy cosmetics products in bulk quantity to sell at his shop. This will help him offer a greater range of products to his customers, so that he can make more sales and income. Amna is hopeful that an investment will be more productive for her husband and bring his business to a more profitable position. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 4th loan application. In previous loan years, she has proved herself a responsible client by paying her installments on time and attended every meeting. \r\n\r\nIn the photo, the woman with a book (an Asasah Passbook) is

The business is small, like most new businesses, but Patricia hopes to grow it over time.  So far, she's doing pretty well.  Not as well as she wants, perhaps, but merchandise is going out as fast as it's coming in and she's making money.  She hopes to consolidate her gains and firmly establish herself as a hardware merchant.  This is her second MFP loan and she's counting on your support.  For her part, she is committed to repaying this loan in the time agreed, just as she did her first loan.  She says, too, that she is happy with her community bank because the members are responsible and supportive.  Patricia will use this loan to buy merchandise to stock her hardware business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":913119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock her hardware store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T21:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":119.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":126.74},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":127.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":137.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":142.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":146.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.97,"local_amount":119.93,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":121.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621977},{"amount":47.53,"local_amount":126.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":128.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836059},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":127.87,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":129.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245819},{"amount":51.43,"local_amount":137.15,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":139.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385852},{"amount":53.36,"local_amount":142.27,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":144.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098942},{"amount":54.76,"local_amount":146.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":148.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713074}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T13:21:52Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":359774,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Virginia es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cKapia Marca\u201d  ubicado en el distrito y  provincia D.

Por esta raz\u00f3n es que al adquirir el panel solar ha buscado el apoyo crediticio en Ceprodel para obtener el cr\u00e9dito que le permita la cancelaci\u00f3n de esta deuda y as\u00ed tener un mejor nivel de vida junto con los suyos para lograr mejorar y salir adelante como cabeza del hogar.\r\n<\/div>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":156987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

This is 34-year-old Irene K. from Mbeya. She is a widow with three children between the ages of 12 and 18.\r\n\r\nIrene has been running a grocery business since 2008. A grocery store is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to, to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nIrene works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week and currently earns about $120 a month.\r\n\r\nIrene is requesting a loan in order to purchase commodities in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Irene thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":320475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase commodities in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":600975,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773316}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T03:26:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":113049,"name":"Eric","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eric N. is married with two children.

Mariana has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\n\nMariana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mariana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Mariana is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mariana plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Es por esto que Lidia, solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el fin de poder comprar por mayor, el hilo que se utiliza para hacer las hamacas, esto con el fin e poder obtenerlo a precios m\u00e1s bajos y as\u00ed ofrecer las hamacas a menor costo. Lidia es una mujer muy constante en su trabajo quien desea poder mejorar sus ventas, ya que esto trae grandes beneficios para su familia.","en":"Lidia Sara\u00ed G. R. is 19 years old and lives in the Moraz\u00e1n department along with her husband and two-year old son in a rented house. Lidia works making hammocks in a variety of colors and styles which she later sells in the tourist zones of the Moraz\u00e1n department. Her job is very well-paid since the hammocks can be somewhat expensive because they are handmade. Despite this, she does not have steady business and does not always manage to make sales. For this reason, Lidia is requesting a loan with the goal of being able to buy at wholesale the thread she uses to make the hammocks. This will allow her to get the thread at lower prices and offer the hammocks at lower prices. Lidia is a very persevering woman in her work and hopes to be able to improve her sales since this will bring great benefits to her family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin,

He lives in his father's house in a large traditional family with his mother and five brothers. This is in the S\u00e9bougou district of S\u00e9gou (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Ousmane left school in the eighth grade of elementary school (according to the Mali education system) to work with his older brother who had a shop selling various items. Having spent two years there, he had mastered the mechanics of business. For the past three years he has been carrying out his own business purchasing and selling a variety of items in a shop in the Angloul\u00eame neighborhood. His shop lies close to Boulevard CAN 2002, a strategic business area of S\u00e9gou. In order to increase his working capital, he turned to Soro Yiriwaso, and he has had relations with this company for the past 24 months. After two individual loans which were repaid without incident, he is on his third individual loan with which he plans to buy half a ton of sugar and a barrel of (edible) oil. He gets his supplies in Bamako and locally from wholesalers. Mr. Ousmane Ciss\u00e9 sells for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of men and women. He expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA. This profit will allow him to help his father cover the household expenses. His ambition is to diversify his activities and open a petrol station.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Joylyn has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Joylyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Joylyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Joylyn is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Joylyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers, and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Since he was a boy he has helped his mother in agriculture, as the primary agricultural activity of the family. Since then he has been in charge of cultivations. For some time now he has started to separate himself from his parents, as he has a family of his own. His primary activity consists of working in harvesting citric fruits, coffee, and to plant and prune the cultivation at a very important agricultural farm in the region. His work is from Monday to Friday, from the early morning hours to the late evening hours. But he is conscious of his needs and the needs of his new family. On Sundays he rests from his work at the farm and he harvests other agricultural farms to earn extra money. Thanks to his good work ethics, Jivann inherited from his parents-in-law a hectare of agricultural land where he is thinking on cultivating on his own account. He will also build a house on a small space given to him by his parents. He belongs to the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro\", meaning \"Light of the Future\" and it is the first loan he has with MFP (Kiva Field Partner).

She is a widow with two children. Her elder child is in college and the younger in high school.  She and her children manage their own household while operating a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one bottle of shampoo, a Php5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Susan gets supplies at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. Her store is located inside her house. At the same time she also manages an adjacent extension of their house as a room for rent. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 28,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of their room for rent. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSusan hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.  There, she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She is 49 years old. She was born and raised in a family of collective farmers. She is a very polite, kind and respectable woman. She got married early, and she has five children. She lives together with her family in a village. Her husband is a migrant worker in Russia. \r\n\r\nAnimal husbandry is her only source of income.

Valentina and her family thank and hope for your generous support. \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Yael Schwartzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nLa agricultura y ganader\u00eda son dos de las actividades que desempe\u00f1a Valentina y de las cuales posee amplio conocimiento. \r\nLa dedicaci\u00f3n, empe\u00f1o y esfuerzo que les hab\u00eda consagrado  durante mucho tiempo, pas\u00f3 a segundo plano cuando su esposo tuvo un terrible accidente que lo dej\u00f3 inhabilitado por 12 a\u00f1os. \r\nValentina hizo que recibiera innumerables tratamientos a fin de que recuperar\u00e1 su vitalidad y deseos de seguir luchando, junto a ella, por sus hijos.\r\nDebido a este infortunado hecho es que los avances que obtuvieron con el trabajo conjunto, se vieron disminuidos y ahora a pesar de los momentos muy tristes por los que tuvieron que atravesar, han decidido iniciar despu\u00e9s de 12 a\u00f1os el proyecto de repotenciar su negocio agr\u00edcola y ganadero para mejorar la calidad de vida de su familia.\r\nA ra\u00edz de este hecho es que ella hace una solicitud de 200 d\u00f3lares para impulsar su prop\u00f3sito con ayuda de su esposo e hijos y se compromete a retornarlos en un lapso de 6 meses.

She is currently expecting a new baby and is very happy about it.  She and her family live in their own house.  She has always been entrepreneurial and in many types of businesses, but since her children are still young with another on the way, she decided 3 months ago to work selling beauty products from her house and thanks to her good customer care and persuasion abilities she has managed to obtain a large client base in her neighborhood.  Many neighbors and friends of hers come to request the products that she offers via catalog.

With summertime approaching, she expects these sales to pick up, so Yicer will use this loan to buy fruit and plastic bags for the ice cream, and bottles for the mabi drink, along with the roots to make it. Yicer expects her sales to allow her to expand her business and make it into a cafeteria. Yicer wants to see her children choose a profession freely, graduate and have successful lives in the workforce. \r\n\r\nPlease help us support Yicer's dream, along with the other entrepreneurs in this Kiva loan.

This is 36-year-old Salma M. from Mwanza. She is married, with five children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old.\n\nSalma has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 2008. Her business is called Caf\u00e9\/Mama Lishe. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\n\nSalma works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. She currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase potatoes and wheat flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Salma thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

With the 1,500 soles she requests she plans to improve her car port so as to provide better service to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":410330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To improve her car port.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-21T00:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":251.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997697},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":251.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843070},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":754.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734648},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":251.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992577}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T08:08:31Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":150059,"name":"Vianca Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vianca es una mujer colaboradora y alegre, vive en la ciudad de Pucallpa, regi\u00f3n de Ucayali, tiene 24 a\u00f1os y es madre de un menor, se dedica a la venta de abarrotes en general, pues cuenta con una bodega que funciona en su casa, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo que es jefe de almac\u00e9n de una tienda de repuestos.

He has water, sewage, and electricity at his home, and a paved road in front of it. His house is made of brick but he would like to continue building it. Jos\u00e9 started selling produce a long time ago after seeing all of his relatives prosper and become independent with similar businesses. Jos\u00e9 decided he wanted the same future. \r\n\r\nToday, Jos\u00e9 works at his store from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week. He buys rice at $0.25 a Lb. and sells it at $0.30; soft drinks at $0.28 and sells them at $0.35 each; and oils at $1.80 and sells them at $2.20 each. One of the biggest problems is crime, which impedes the store from getting ahead. Sometimes, Jos\u00e9's wife helps out with the business, but to help increase the family income, she sells vegetables. They don't have any kids because they want to have a secure future first. \r\n\r\nWith the loan he is requesting, Jos\u00e9 wants to buy rice at $25.00 per \"quintal\" (46 Kg); oils at $22.00 per box; and soft drinks at $8.50 per crate. He would like to start another store and continue with his business to ensure a good future for his family and to finish building his house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":449401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying rice, soft drinks, and oils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T20:30:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":960,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":120.24},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":129.6},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":140.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":143.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":155.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":124.03,"local_amount":122.12,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":124.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074050},{"amount":129.71,"local_amount":127.72,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":129.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910017},{"amount":136.76,"local_amount":134.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":136.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945582},{"amount":138.46,"local_amount":136.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":138.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673945},{"amount":142.35,"local_amount":140.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":142.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708108},{"amount":303.69,"local_amount":299.02,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":303.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891315}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T22:57:19Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":166598,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort is thirty-six years old, is single, and has no child.

Salma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Salma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & snack foods. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Salma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":731497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell such as canned goods & snack foods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tambo, Hinaplanon, Iligan City, Lanao del Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":546.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201296650},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1365.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206164933},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211237540},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216516181},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1365.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221681470}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T18:32:39Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:56:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":286008,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 40 years old and married with four children.

product line that never ceases to gain regular customers is one that serves the food market. Sarah M., 62, banks on this fact and runs a food micro-enterprise. Sarah is married to Wilfredo, a driver, and together they have raised children who are now in college. Sarah is out to prove that having finished only three years of high school does not limit her in business.\r\n\r\nAt present, Sarah runs a food stall, called a \"carinderia\", in the Philippines. The carinderia is annexed to their house, so she is able to manage both the household chores and the daily routines in the carinderia. This business of hers has been running for 15 years now, and with the diligence she puts into her work and the quality training and spiritual support she receives from CCT*, Sarah manages to earn Php 15,000 net income every month. She has one employee hired to help her with the daily tasks in her carinderia.\r\n\r\nBecause Sarah aims to serve nothing but quality food to her customers, she decided to borrow Php 10,000 to better finance her business. She intends to use this loan money to purchase meat products, vegetables, and other nutritious ingredients to come up with daily sumptuous meals. With this loan, Sarah is also equipped to meet the daily needs of her family and pay for the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Sarah faces is the competition she has in the community, since there are not a few business-minded people like her who have set up food stalls in the vicinity. But Sarah is not going to give up the fight.
