She lives in one of the few areas that has water, light, and sewage services.  Her father started the tire repair shop, and through much effort her siblings have been able to succeed with it.  Now, Shirley manages it. \r\n\r\nShirley buys large tires for $25.00, and sells them for $40.00.  She buys small tires for $6.00, and sells them for $12.00.  The difficulties she has are thieves when she transports the tires, and the landlord is bothered by the noise from the machines.  \r\n\r\nHer husband helps her with the household expenses.  He works installing marble in gated communities.  They do not have children.  But, in order to be able to have a larger family Shirley wants to be stable in a house and not rent one.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use the loan to buy more tires and pipes, 950, in order to expand her business.

A. tiene 37 a\u00f1os y vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposa y tres hijos en el barrio Ciudadela 20 de Julio de Barranquilla. El tiene un puesto estacionario en las afueras del centro comercial Metrocentro, al sur de la ciudad, en el cual vende estuches para tel\u00e9fonos celular, control remoto de televisores y CD de m\u00fasica y videos. El negocio comenz\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2006 por sugerencia de un amigo quien le prest\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o capital para comprar mercanc\u00eda. Al principio tuvo dificultad para ubicar los pedidos de los clientes por la enorme cantidad de CD que tiene, pero hoy en d\u00eda es un experto, e incluso, se atreve a recomendar canciones de artistas populares o pel\u00edculas. Este es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra de art\u00edculos de papeler\u00eda como agendas, libretas y lapiceros para atender la pr\u00f3xima temporada escolar que comienza en Enero.  El promedio de ventas semanales es de $ 600.000 COP y el margen de utilidad es del 40%.Antes de estar vinculado a la Fundaci\u00f3n, el microempresario se financiaba con cr\u00e9ditos de particulares que deb\u00eda cancelar en cuotas diarias y a unas elevadas tasas de inter\u00e9s. Por la experiencia positiva que ha tenido en la Fundaci\u00f3n, ha recomendado a varios amigos comerciantes que tambi\u00e9n se vinculen. Recientemente  el se\u00f1or Carlos se capacit\u00f3 en contabilidad, mercadeo y endeudamiento. Esto le ha permitido llevar un mejor control de sus cuentas que se reflejan en la puntualidad de sus pagos y el mejoramiento de la calidad de vida de su familia. Su sue\u00f1o en el futuro es comprar una casa propia y para lograrlo ya empez\u00f3 a ahorrar.","en":"Carlos Alberto G. A. is 37 years old and lives with his wife and three children in 'Ciudadela 20 de Julio' neighborhood of Barranquilla.  He has a stationary stall just outside the Metrocentro shopping mall, in the south of the city, where he sells cell phone cases, television remote controls, music CDs and videos.  He started his business in 2006.  It was his friend who suggested he start his business and this friend also loaned him a small amount of capital with which to buy merchandise.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, Carlos had trouble locating his customers' orders because of the enormous quantity of CDs but he is now an expert and he even dares to recommend songs by popular artists, or movies.\r\n\r\nThis is Carlos' fourth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest it in buying stationery items such as diaries, notebooks and pens for the upcoming back-to-school season which begins in January.  His average weekly sales are 600,000 Colombian pesos and his profit margin is 40%.  Before he came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, this small businessman financed his business with personal loans that he had to pay back in daily instalments, paying very high interest rates.  As a result of his own positive experience with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, he has recommended us to several friends who are also salespeople and they have joined too.\r\n\r\nRecently, Carlos received training in accountancy, marketing and debt management.  This has enabled him to take better control of his accounts and this has been reflected in the punctuality of his repayments and the improvement of his family's quality of life.  His dream for the future is to buy his own home and he has already started to save in order to achieve this goal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":679149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stationery items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-12-27T18:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":69302},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":77123},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78409},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":79716},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":81044},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82395},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83768},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85164},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":86584},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":88027},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":89494},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":98974}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.49},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.85},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.38,"local_amount":69302,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":69674.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001196},{"amount":40.49,"local_amount":77123,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77537.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289217},{"amount":41.17,"local_amount":78409,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":78830.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157357},{"amount":41.85,"local_amount":79716,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":80144.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230365},{"amount":42.55,"local_amount":81044,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":81479.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509232},{"amount":43.25,"local_amount":82395,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82837.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673452},{"amount":43.98,"local_amount":83768,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84218.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320011},{"amount":44.71,"local_amount":85164,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85621.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803155},{"amount":45.46,"local_amount":86584,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":87049.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614247},{"amount":69.21,"local_amount":131820,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":132528.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568230},{"amount":75.95,"local_amount":144675,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":145452.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779577}],"funded_date":"2010-12-28T02:00:30Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":265494,"name":"Eden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eden L. is from the village of Agoho, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling clothing and shoe products from NATASHA & AVON in the local community. She also makes and sells snacks such as chicken and pork kababs and hotdogs on a stick. Eden has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eden joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. Eden is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional ingredients for the kababs, such as pork and chicken meat. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Eden from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Having learned farming as a child, Mariluz works the land and makes it productive.  Thanks to her experience and savings she has managed to own four acres of farmland where she grows coffee, bananas and yucca.  She sells them at the La Merced market, wholesale.  What she enjoys most about her work is caring for the crops.  She has been in this activity for four years and feels the hardest part is transporting her products to the market since the sacks are very heavy and this takes a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the support she receives from her husband who helps with the farm activity and coordinates the planting seasons.  \"Together we plan out the next harvest.\", she says cheerfully.  \"Our goal is to have our own capital.\"  In the future she wants to buy more land to increase crop production so she can give her children a better future.  She belongs to the communal bank \"AROMA DE CAF\u00c9\" and this is her second loan through MFP.  She hopes this small loan can help her reach her goals.  She is committed to paying it back on time, as she has done previously.  She enjoys being a part of the communal bank because all of its members are responsible, supportive people.  If Mariluz receives your support she will invest the money in a new pulper to hull ripe coffee beans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":790019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a coffee pulper.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariluz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":828.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621351}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T12:58:26Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":310572,"name":"Hamza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamza (who appears in the picture) has a tailoring workshop.

It is located in the Felipe Coamango community, Chapa de Mota municipality, Estado de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico.    It has 10 members and this is their first loan request to CrediCom\u00fan.\r\n\r\nZenaida L. Gonz\u00e1lez, 26, is group president.  She finished 6th grade and is a housewife and a merchant.  She has 4 children.  She has sold cosmetics for the last 2 years; she also raises chickens and turkeys.  She is asking for funds to stock up on cosmetics and perfumes to sell.\r\n\r\nZenaida C. E., 47, is a group member.  She finished 6th grade, is a housewife and farmer.  She has 7 children; 3 girls and 4 boys, all of whom are married.  She has raised calves for the last 8 years.  She is asking for funds to buy feed and pasturage for the calves she already has and, once they reach proper weight, sell them and buy new ones to raise and continue with the business.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of asking for this loan, she feels motivated and supported because she\u2019s a new open door.  She wants this loan to fatten up her calves and help her business to grow.  She has always raised animals and considers this to be a profitable business because she has made profits from them that have made it possible for her to buy chickens and turkeys, which have been life savers sometimes and they have always been a sure source of nourishment for her family so that food has never been lacking.  Similarly, she has bought donkeys that she uses to transport cargo because, without them, the work would be much too heavy.  In addition, she has been able to invest in home improvements thus improving her quality of life.  She hopes that her equity will continue to grow so that someday, when she and her husband are no longer able to work, they will have a bit of savings put away to live with dignity.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\n-\tAna Rosario L\u00f3pez C.

The official name of this borrowing group is Tulips.\r\n\r\nRubilyn is married and has an infant child. To make a living, Rubilyn operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products, such as sugar, milo (milk beverage), biscuits, shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Rubilyn has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rubilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rubilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC.

Cows on her farm are affected by harsh weather conditions, hence, they become sick.

Every Sunday evening around 8pm, Aneta and several other Roma hop on a chartered microbus (closer to a minivan than a bus) and travel down to Istanbul.  Among the group is \u201cBaba Zeira\u201d, (Grandmother Zeira), who has also received a loan from Kiva: <p>\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=392 <p>\r\n\r\nThis group, predominately comprised of women, arrive in Istanbul between 6 and 7am Monday morning, passing through the border crossing at Svelingrad in the middle of the night.  They split up and spend the entire day shopping in the garment district (near the main bazaar) for the types of clothes they each sell in Sliven.  They get back on their minibus with bags of merchandise for the next week that evening, and are back in Sliven Tuesday morning.  <p>\r\n\r\nAneta focuses on dresses, which are predominately worn at Roma weddings and other major events.  Her gross margin is good \u2013 45% - but the constant travel back and forth to Istanbul is taxing, both financially and mentally.  This loan will give her the working capital to purchase more inventory on individual trips and make that trip less often.  In addition, she\u2019ll be able to expand the breadth of her offerings and offer her clients more selection.  <p>\r\n\r\nA short video clip taken inside Aneta\u2019s house \/ warehouse can be found here: <p>\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3rJ_iuSpi5Q\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":6782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BG","country":"Bulgaria","town":"Sliven","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42.685833 26.329167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":3,"posted_date":"2006-12-10T20:08:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aneta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-28T21:12:52Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2007-02-12T13:37:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7366},{"amount":276,"local_amount":276,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T11:58:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":276,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23296},{"amount":276,"local_amount":276,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:00:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":276,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23312},{"amount":276,"local_amount":276,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T12:00:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":276,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23328},{"amount":137,"local_amount":137,"processed_date":"2007-07-30T12:27:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37110},{"amount":137,"local_amount":137,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T10:53:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71091},{"amount":136,"local_amount":136,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T13:13:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87117},{"amount":69,"local_amount":69,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T13:01:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106716},{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T07:23:12Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279257}],"funded_date":"2006-12-14T21:12:52Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T07:23:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6553,"name":"Prisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Prisca lives in the Vingunguti area of Dar es Salaam.

While her husband has a job doing development work for the government, Nuru works from home doing embroidery, knitting, and tie & dye. She makes bed sheets, chair cushions, sweaters, and tie-dyed dresses and sells them door-to-door to schools, offices, and homes.\r\n<p>\r\nNuru started her business over two years ago. Before this business, she fried fish, chapattis, and donuts to sell on the street. Because frying was a hot and tiring job, she finds that her new business suits her much better.\r\n<p>\r\nWith a roll of fabric, costing about $24, Nuru is able to make a profit of about $20. A roll of fabric makes about 10 pieces of clothing, and it takes about a week to go through the roll. It takes her about a day to make a tie-dyed dress, 4 days to knit a baby\u2019s outfit, and a week to embroider a bed sheet. She generally works from 4am to 4pm every day. Her sister assists her when she has free time. In a month, Nuru makes between $130 and $160.\r\n<p>\r\nNuru spends the profits from her business on her children and toward school fees. She also sends money to her mother who is financially dependent on her. She puts what is remaining in savings with the hope of buying land one day.\r\n<p>\r\nNuru is the leader of Subgroup B of Tegemeo (Swahili for \u201cexpectation\u201d).

This subgroup has taken out 3 previous loans from Tujijenge Tanzania to enhance their businesses, and they were able to pay each back successfully. \r\n<p>\r\nNuru used the previous loans to buy more materials for her business.

The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fish ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-10T00:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bafou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sophie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636072},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037982},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262086},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703070},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132656},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046925},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892474},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780982}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:05Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:58:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104881,"name":"Grupo Plaza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el grupo plaza es un grupo con integrantes jovenes y muy unidos que tienen muchas ganas de superarse, este grupo se conforma de la siguiente manera:\nChristian Daniel M. de 23 a\u00f1os de edad que es el cordinador del grupo, este muchacho se dedica a la venta de ropa interior, camisas, blusas, zapatos y juguetes, el vende estos productos en la colonia que recide y tambien viaja los fines de semana junto con la mama al departamento de Olancho en la zona del mercado de campamento, el tiene mas de 5 a\u00f1os de dedicarse a las ventas con este proceso se ayuda a cubrir los gastos que tiene en la universidad. \n La Sra.

She was married and has two children out of that marriage: Elariceli, age 17, and Francisco Javier, age 22. Both are married. Maria has made tamales and toast with cream in bulk for four years. She makes good income from her home. She says that she decided to do this type of business to help out with her household costs and tend to her family. Before, she worked in houses as a maid to support her children. With the earnings from her business she buys ingredients for the tamales, such as corn, oil, meat, and raisins; and for the toast she buys cream. Thus, she re-invests in order to keep working without any problems. This way she is also able to save to repay this loan from Fundacion Realidad A.C. \r\n\r\nAntonia's dream is to build a solid kitchen so that she can better do her job, since currently she just has planks and the wind does not allow her to progress. She would also like for this job to change her living conditions so that she can get ahead.\r\n\r\nThey made this group because of a promotion in their village. Rosaura is the group representative. They were interested in her and asked her to join them. The group is called Campo Verde [\"Green Field\"] because in the area the group is located there are hills and spaces of green grass.

There she grows cocoa, coffee, barbasco [a plant bearing natural poison used in fishing] and bananas. \r\n\r\nWhat she most enjoys about her work is the harvest, since it is then that she feels the months of arduous labor have been rewarded with the high quality of her crops. She has been in this business for four years and believes the most difficult aspect is transporting her crops from her community to the collection centers located in the city of San Francisco [Peru]. Now she hopes to put together enough money to buy some new land. This is her first loan with MFP. She knows she is responsible for making all her payments punctually and she is willing to do so. She thanks the members of her communal bank for adding her to the group. With the loan she is seeking she will buy materials for refurbishing her housing. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":778396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase construction materials to refurbish her housing.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":950108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-12-18T22:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275084},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416549},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-23T08:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131350},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947150},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296538},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646197},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-01T08:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226870},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-23T10:04:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489421},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094397},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200634}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T22:44:49Z","paid_date":"2013-01-20T10:30:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Meltzer","image":null}},{"id":380299,"name":"Peres","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peres is a 38-year-old single mother of two children.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term, and almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":219428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

These are the very reasons why they took up the \"lechon\" business.

She has to be vigilant about feeding and cleaning him and giving him his medication on time. This is a serious duty which does not allow her to extend her activities too far from home. Egusi and firewood sales have been her main business activities since she joined GHAPE in October 27, 1998. She peels egusi seeds and sells them both in wholesale and in retail. She is one of the founding beneficiaries in GHAPE. With her previous loans she succeeded in providing her community with egusi and dry firewood. \r\n<p>\r\nIf she is given this tenth loan, she plans to buy a transportation motorbike and well as stocking up on egusi and firewood. Her son will be providing transportation on the motorbike. She will also re-invest part of the profit into her business for expansion and she will pay school fees for her children. She will also use part of her profit for food, clothing, and paying hospital bills.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE):\r\n<p>\r\nGHAPE is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and provides poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":350658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a transportation motorbike and to buy egusi and firewood for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

She prefers to stay at home; she carries out her responsibilities as a housewife and takes care of her children well. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband who wants to repair his rickshaw, because his rickshaw is having problems and can't run for long enough. With the fully repaired rickshaw, he will continue to give his best transport services to the passengers and increase his monthly income. \r\n<p>\r\nKhalida is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her third loan application.

G. is from Maybato North, San Jose, Antique, Philippines. She is married to Andres G., who is a fisherman, and they have six dependents. Carmen is a woman who has never lost her hope of getting out of poverty and, in many ways, her poverty makes her stronger. Carmen and her husband earn their living by fishing. Their income helps them provide for their basic needs and Carmen has learned how to save their small income for the future. \r\n\r\nCarmen has been an active member of ASHI for almost 14 years. During her time as a member, she has experienced repayment difficulties but she has never given up and has always faced her problems. For Carmen, money is important, and she has proven that she can be trusted with a bigger loan. \r\n\r\nAs of now, Carmen is an ASHI member who has received one of the larger branch loans. She has fully repaid her previous loan and is requesting a loan of 40,000 PHP to purchase a pump boat for her fishing business. Purchasing this boat will greatly help her family increase their income and meet their basic needs. In the future, Carmen wishes that her children will finish their education and that her family will have a comfortable house and savings for the future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Kyrgyzstan). He is married and has three daughters, the eldest of which is 17 years old. Mirgazy born into a simple farmer's family. He was the eldest of the brothers, and so most of his time was devoted to household chores, helping his father care for the cattle. At the end of the ninth grade, Mirgazy entered the College of Food in Karabalta (in the Chuy region of Kyrgyzstan), studying  grain production. \n\nAfter graduating from college in 1996, he was drafted into the army, where he served for a year and a half. After serving, Mirgazy came to his village and went to work as a farm mechanic. His work on the farm did not last long.  Because of low wages, he resigned and took a job for the city Karabalta.

Using a start-up capital in the amount of 3,000 soms (KGS), he successfully developed his business and now has a monthly income of 6.000 som (KGS). In 2009, Mirgazy received a loan in the company Bai Tushum & Partners to buy cows and bulls. After the timely repayment of his first loan he has kept a milk cow. In order to further develop his business, Mirgazy has applied for a loan in the amount of 70,000 Som (KGS) to buy cattle. \n\nMirgazy plans to increase his livestock.  His dream is to put his daughters through the university and buy a new home.\n\nZAO MFK Bai Tushum & Partners provides loans through Kiva for socially vulnerable population regions.

The business activities proposed by the group are: <p>\r\n\u2022\tAgriculture: This consists of gardening, where the investment needs are: inputs (seeds, fertilizer, phytosanitary products), and equipment (watering cans, rakes, hoes, wheelbarrows, pitchforks, etc.) <p>\r\n\u2022\tCommerce:  This is our group\u2019s main business activity; using local produce grown by our group, the members market their products throughout the region, especially in the surrounding villages.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":6884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of seeds and equipment for gardening; transportation of produce to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Mlomp","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.828889 -16.5275","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-10T20:09:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fulomene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-26T03:14:37Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":127.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":127.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":115,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2007-04-17T20:28:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13179},{"amount":115,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16980},{"amount":115,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16995},{"amount":1,"local_amount":1,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T16:35:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34384},{"amount":117,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:13:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41466},{"amount":116,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50203},{"amount":116,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:41:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63343},{"amount":116,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80047},{"amount":116,"local_amount":116,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93782},{"amount":463,"local_amount":463,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":463,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106879}],"funded_date":"2006-12-12T03:14:37Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6585,"name":"Masnah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Masnah is a 32 year old mother of three children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in an area outside the central city called Para\u00edso, which is characterized by dirt paths and a deteriorating ecology. \r\n\r\nHer husband emigrated to Spain to have more work opportunities. When he obtained work, he sent money to Jenny so that she could have her own business. With this working capital, she bought groceries in order to establish a small store. Little by little, with much effort, she was able to expand her store to include produce and chickens.

Cooking was not one of the things that she was pleased to do, but for the time being the need to help her spouse with the costs of the household forced her to learn to prepare a variety of foods for sale.  Then she saw that the demand for her food grew every day and in this line of work she did not need to leave her home because they installed a small countertop in the doorway of their house, facilitating her work as a mother and as a saleswoman.  She could see that her cooking skill was improving and that people welcomed her gourmet menu, which motivated her and gave her satisfaction.  Since then her business has given her new perspectives and now she is interested in opening a large restaurant that could hold a large number of people and which would be a restaurant of prestige.  \r\n\r\nMarleny is in her fourth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and hopes to continue working in this way because she has had the opportunity to discover her skills and abilities, not only in her business, but also in her relations with people.  Marleny plans to invest the 2500 soles that she is asking for in the decoration of the space that she has for her business and to buy some utensils for improving the interest of her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Donna Yates, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":291379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To improve her place of business and to buy utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":309}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012284},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595866},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990133},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211259},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640769},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080231},{"amount":100.16,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":315,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996492},{"amount":98.88,"local_amount":309,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":311,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842000}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T22:40:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donna Yates","image":146613}},{"id":100833,"name":"Comfort","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Comfort A. is 50 years old.

Their boat, that is used in transporting passengers to cross the river, needs repair. Since Victorina has already paid back her previous loan, she is again asking for a loan of PHP 7,000 from Kiva lenders to be able pursue their daily ferryboat operation. According to her, the boat is already ruined, has holes, and parts are already old that need to be replaced. She hopes that their business will improve and that they are able to pursue their business and generate more income.\r\n\t\r\nVictorina is married to Romeo T., a farmer. Their children are: Isidro, 30 years old, who is presently employed as a security guard; Rubelyn, 29, who is already married; and Nazarene. These three are all college graduates while their youngest is a special child and, because of this, he was not able to go to school. Victorina hopes that somehow, with their very poor livelihood, someday they will overcome the hardships of

For twelve years he has offered electrical services, as he studied to be an electrician. However, since this work does not provide steady income, a year ago, he joined two friends to open an electricity workshop, tire repair shop, and a pool hall. Each man does his own separate work but when paying rent all colloborate in equal amounts.  Marcos considers himself a proactive young man and, for the past eight years, has dedicated his free time to the buying and selling of grains and animals. The business is going very well. He likes his new business because the site of the workshop is very inviting and located in a good area for attracting customers.
