It is a feast of green leaves and grasses, of bright red and yellow tulips in the mountains and a blue sky, which is so close to you in spring. At the same time the national dress is one of the most important items in the dowry of a girl. \r\n<p>\r\nTursunoy has very good taste and she is ready to advise her clients about which textiles to choose for this or that occasion. This is why she has her constant and loyal customers. Her eldest daughter helps her with the business. Also, Tursunoy\u2019s prices for fabrics are attractive for various income levels; she has a wide range of goods for any taste and any wallet. She has two trading places, in two different markets. \r\n<p>\r\nAll this allows Tursunoy to keep her clientele and to make a good income. The income that she derives allows her to educate all of her children at a high level.

Her husband, Mr. Kong Kan, is a bean middleman who buys bean to keep in stock and re-sell later at a better price. Mrs. Hout S. is 40 years old and the mother of five children, who are all attending the local school. (Mrs. Hang S. did not come to accept the loan, but her husband did and is present in the picture instead). \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. These allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

Luz Maria is a partner and has four children of 26, 17, 16, and 9 years.  The younger children are studying in state school.  \r\n\r\nLuz Maria's family had a business, a poultry shop.  Since she was a girl, she has worked there with her father, and it was here that her taste for business was born.  When her father died, the real estate was divided, closing the poultry shop.  At the age of 17 years, she had her first son and went to live with her husband.  However, the economic pressure was strong, and she worked to sell sandwiches with her brother.  They now sell more than 280 sandwiches weekly from Tuesday to Sunday, resting on Mondays.  In the mornings, she knits and crochets sweaters in her home for a business than exports them to another country.  \r\n\r\nSince she started with Finca, she has received help to succeed in her business.  Now, she has a special cart for the sandwiches.

Gulbahor learnt about the loan program and is very interested in participating and getting credit to buy more livestock so as to later sell it.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":309642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more livestock ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-28T06:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulbahor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":258.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600070},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":258.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994484},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":258.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215734},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":258.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645222},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":258.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084791},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":258.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000987}],"funded_date":"2009-04-28T07:02:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:29:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Olga Espira","image":null}},{"id":108593,"name":"Dupe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dupe A. is 32 years old and married with four children.

She is married to a casual worker (similar to a day-laborer in the US). Elizabeth used to run a salon but but now cooks mandazi (a donut-like pastry) because the salon was too expensive to keep up. She hopes to use this loan to re-stock her salon, which she will run out of her house in Nyalenda slum. Elizabeth tells us that she is struggling to pay school fees for her children right now and says if she receives her loan, she will work harder. She says her kids love going to school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Elizabeth saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Elizabeth responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting.

Estrella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Estrella is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Estrella from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with his wife and youngest child in the San Jos\u00e9 cove, a fishing region located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has devoted almost his whole life to fishing.  This is temporary work.  Because of the closed fishing season, he does not fish all year.  During these seasons he worked in a nearby shipyard, but he had to leave that work due to his age.  For three years he has had a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (a vehicle used for transportation), which he uses to earn the daily sustenance for his family.\r\n\r\nDue to its constant use, the vehicle has started to suffer from some mechanical problems.  That is why he saw the need to ask the institution for a loan for 500 PEN.  He will use the loan to fix and maintain his vehicle in order to continue supporting his family.\r\n\r\nMiguel has had four previous loans with the Institution.  He repaid them punctually.  He is a very responsible person who has known how to support and help his 10 children succeed.  Nine of his children are married and have diverse jobs in the region where they live.\r\n\r\nHe wishes to give his youngest child the opportunity to continue his education.  This way he will be assured of a promising future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":369877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance of mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Jos\u00e9 - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":44.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":46.65},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":48.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":53.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":60.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.05,"local_amount":40.14,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":41.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027744},{"amount":14.71,"local_amount":42.02,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939641},{"amount":15.62,"local_amount":44.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":45.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780549},{"amount":16.32,"local_amount":46.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":47.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669453},{"amount":16.89,"local_amount":48.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":49.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064963},{"amount":17.68,"local_amount":50.51,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900080},{"amount":18.88,"local_amount":53.93,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":55.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934214},{"amount":19.29,"local_amount":55.13,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":56.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661866},{"amount":20.42,"local_amount":58.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":59.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694587},{"amount":21.14,"local_amount":60.39,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877654}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T16:18:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":133204,"name":"Jenelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelyn C. is from the village of Mialen, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

She is a widow and has been caring for her two children since 1985. She makes her living by selling soft drinks and frozen foods in the local markets. She is also a rice retailer - buying and selling sacks of rice. With her food business, she gets contracts from Iloilo in the province of Panay to the north of Negros Occidental.\n\nBefore joining Project Dungganon in 2002, Corazon sold products door-to-door, including ready-to-wear (used) clothing and Avon beauty products. With her loan from Project Dungganon, she was able to expand her frozen foods business and eventually move into the rice dealing business. Her current loan of 15,000 pesos will be beneficial in making investments in her business.\n\nCorazon has a son and a daughter who have both graduated from college and are off on their own. She is incredibly proud of their achievements since they both chose to become public servants. Her daughter is a teacher in the national high school and her son is a policeman. Corazon has a 3-month-old grandson with her son.\n\nEventually, Corazon plans to move out from her present house and settle down in one of the nicer subdivisions. She has already bought a plot of land but cannot afford to build a home yet. She needs Php 100,000 \u2013 about $2,500 \u2013 to build a house. One day she will get that home while still being a member of Project Dungganon.\n\nCorazon is a member of good standing. She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\n\n About NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":482320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She makes her purchases on credit and pays when she finishes selling her products.  She is requesting a loan so that she can buy the supplies that she needs in one go and pay cash for them.  This will enable her to buy them at a better price and so will be able to help her parents more.  In addition, she would also like to buy some tables and chairs so that her customers can eat what she sells on site.\r\n\r\nMarcos would like to have a hut in the park in her community and would also like to save her profits.  She currently makes her sales outside her house and when it rains she can't go out and sell her products because they get wet.

For now, she is selling candies and cold drinks in the streets of her neighbourhood.  She has found a spot where she sets up her stall every day, leaving at 8:00 in the morning to offer her various refreshments and candies to passers-by.  This is a very tiring activity as all day she attends to her clients who come to buy her snacks.  Nevertheless, been a street vendor does not help her improve her business and because of this she wants to open a store in her home so that she no longer has to leave home every morning to spend the day exposed to the sun.

This is 35-year-old Happiness B. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, aged two and four. Happiness has been running a caf\u00e9 called Caf\u00e9\/Mama Lishe since 2007. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), and plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at the business for twelve hours a day, six days a week and is assisted by two employees. Happiness currently earns about $120 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 to purchase rice, wheat flour, eggs and cooking oil. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Happiness thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their business equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, which enables them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To  purchase rice, wheat flour, eggs and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Happyness","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613672},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010751},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233037},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664828},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105540},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022668},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867917},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757118},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146230},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984392}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T02:07:08Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":100417,"name":"Joice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joice J. sells cooking oil, tomatoes and oranges and is requesting a loan to open up a shop.

He is 22, married, and father to two children aged 5 and 1, who do not yet go to school.  Osvaldo finished twefth grade but did not continue because he was not accepted to University.  He lives in his parents' house with his family and also supports his parents, who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe never left Boane; he grew up and studied always in this District.  For more than four years he has worked for ECMEP, a road and bridge construction company.  He has no employees and has a monthly salary of 4,300 meticais.  He uses the money for household expenses and still manages to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo has never had loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers at this institution.  This loan for 21,000 meticais is his fifth.  He plans to buy construction material (sand, cement, iron, beams and other items) to continue construction on his house.  The earlier loans were for 7,200 meticais, 3,200 meticais, 13,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais.  They were used for the house and consumer goods.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he can maintain his credit.  In the future he would like to ask for more loans to finish his house and begin a commercial activity to increase his income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Kasur is known for its leather industry. \r\nShe is a 46-year-old housewife who is married to M. A. and has given birth to four sons and two daughters. \r\n\r\nFor the last 15 years, Zarina\u2019s husband has been involved in the business of making shoes. He operates his business from his home. He collects orders from different shoe stores and provides them finished goods to earn an income for his family. \r\n\r\nZarina\u2019s three elder sons help their father in his business. They started to support their father after they completed their 10th standard grade in school. Zarina also helps her husband in his business in her spare time. \r\n\r\nDue to an increase in manpower, Zarina\u2019s husband now can produce larger quantities of shoes and offer his services to more clients. But in order to produce shoes in larger quantities, he needs more raw materials, such as nails, shoe polish and leather.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, Zarina has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband. The loan amount will help him to buy raw materials used in manufacturing shoes in larger quantities, which will help him fulfill larger orders on time. \r\n\r\nZarina is hopeful that her family business will grow as a result of investing money into it. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":594159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase raw material for shoe-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4091},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4090}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360413},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360414},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182495088},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630001},{"amount":50.01,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372930},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:19:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790384},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232170},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098612},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169015},{"amount":50,"local_amount":4091,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4270.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451759},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":4090,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4269.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615714}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T16:50:46Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Allison Bruce","image":77230}},{"id":232373,"name":"Maja","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maja J. is from the town of Banga.

She is a very charismatic and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her partner, 27 year-old Edwin, and her beloved daughter Ariana who is the motivation behind all her hard work.  \r\n\r\nJessica became interested in clothes when she was very young.  For this reason, she decided to sell clothes for a living.  She currently works a hard work week, delivering her clothes to her customers' homes since she tells us that in this way she makes more profits.  Jessica herself buys and transports the clothes from the city of Lima (approximately 20 hours away by land).  She also sells cosmetics through a catalog and runs a small bar.\r\n\r\nWhat Jessica most likes about her work is advising her customers about the clothes that are in fashion in the capital since she feels that this helps her gain the trust of her buyers.  She has been in this business for 3 years and she considers that the most difficult part of her work is transporting the heavy bundles of clothes.  However, even so, she does not give up since she knows that her family's well-being depends on her business.  Over time, she would like to be able to set up a store in the city of San Francisco in which she could provide a better service to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Jessica's third loan with MFP and she is ready to make her loan repayments on time since she would like to access new loans in the future.

With the help of her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy wood, plywood nails, etc. so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Josefina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her

Since then he has helped his father unconditionally in covering their household expenses.  His father taught him all he needed to know to start working in farming.  He started sowing his own crops three years ago.  On his farmland he sows different varieties of potato seeds.  What he most enjoys about his work is being able to care for his crops against the constant pests that attack the place.  Over the years, he has managed to save up and buy four cows and three bulls.  He uses the bulls to plow land; he offers his services to third parties and earns, on average, 65 Peruvian soles a day.\r\n\r\n\"Constant work\" is Jhon's motto.  In his spare time, he also works in construction, building houses.  This young man has high aspirations.  He would like to save up enough money to set up a store in the city of Tarma.

The couple have a daughter, Melina, who they care for in their own home which is located in the small village of Usibamba.  She is engaged in a number of activities.  Very early in the mornings, she opens the doors of her home where she set up a grocery store some time ago.  She sells basic household products and, as a country woman, she also raises livestock.  She has four cows and she sells the milk that they produce for a good price as it is very nutritious and has good texture.  She also grows crops on her farmland: oats, beans, peas and potatoes.  She tells us that she started working independently 15 years ago as she had to help her family.  She does not rest.  She would like to increase her profits by purchasing pigs which would also make her money.  She plans to fatten them and sell them to local butcher's.\r\n\r\nElba is a member of the 'Usibamba' community bank and this is her second loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your support so that she can continue achieving her goals.  She pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments as she was with her previous loan.

In 1986 she took over the family business located in the neighborhood of Xipamanine in Maputo. For family reasons, she had to move to the rural district of Boane where she established a small shop in the local market.  In 2006 friends, neighbors and other store owners introduced her to Hluvuku-Adsema where she got her first loan to grow her business.  The amount was very small but it gave her a chance to learn how to manage credit.  Now her business is going well and provides employment to three workers (two women and a man).  With the profits from her business she has created a Xitique (a local form of savings account). Daily she supports the school fees of three children.  With the loan of 10,000,000MT she intends to increase her stock of products.  Her business has a large impact on the community. In addition to providing a service she also guarantees the employment of three other people, brings products closer to the customer, and provides refreshments to all the merchants and drivers at the market. She hopes to grow her business to best meet the needs of the market and to also increase the size of her home which is no longer big enough for her current circumstances.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Kiva Volunteer Julie Lerch<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nRaquel M. de 48 anos de idade, natural da cidade do Maputo, casada, m\u00e3e de 2 filhos.

Even when faced with these problems, Chrispinus has successfully completed a previous loan with Juhudi Kilimo and has maintained profitable business operations.\r\n\r\nChrispinus requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 25,000 to expand his stock of poultry in an effort to further diversify his farm production.

Es madre cabeza de familia y vive con su hijo de 20 a\u00f1os que la ayuda en su negocio de preparaci\u00f3n y venta de comidas r\u00e1pidas. Martina aprendi\u00f3 c\u00f3mo elaborar empanadas y papas rellenas de su cu\u00f1ada y ahora vende papas rellenas, empanadas santandereanas con carne, huevo y arroz, a\u00f1adi\u00e9ndoles perros calientes los fines de semana.

Tiene un carrito de comidas r\u00e1pidas a cada uno de sus dos vendedores que ubican en la terminal de transportes para servir a su clientela mayormente compuesta de pasajeros de bus intermunicipales.\nCon este su quinto cr\u00e9dito de $ 1.500.000, Martina planea comprar materias primas como arroz, az\u00facar, papas y aceite en mayor volumen y hacer algunos pagos a proveedores para ganar descuento a largo plazo.

El mayor desaf\u00edo del trabajo es que es muy agotador: se levanta a las 3:20 cada ma\u00f1ana y a las 9:00 de la noche todav\u00eda no ha terminado. Sue\u00f1a con tener su propia vivienda y su propio local para no salir a recorrer las calles.

P., a native of San Vicente de Chucur\u00ed, a municipality in the Santander department, lives in the suburb of Ciudadela Metropolitana in the Soledad municipality, part of the metropolitan area of Barranquilla. She is a mother and head of the family, and lives with her 20 year old son who helps her in her business preparing and selling fast food. Martina learned to make empanadas and stuffed potatoes from her sister-in-law and now she sells stuffed potatoes, Santander empanadas with meat, eggs and rice, and also makes hot dogs on the weekends. She also prepares chicha from rice and oats, drinks which she produced in Santandean style, adding vanilla and cinnamon, the flavours of her region. She has a fast food cart that each of her 2 sales people use, located in the transport terminal to serve customers who are passengers of the municipal buses. \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan of $1,500. Martina plans to purchase large volumes of ingredients such as rice, sugar, potatoes and oil and to make some payments to provedors to obtain a discount in the long term. She arrived at Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 3 years ago through her daughter-in-law. She expresses that from this date on the loans have served her to expand the business because she has gone from selling empanadas and fried food from a basket to having 2 food carts to transport the food; and she has a small fridge where she bottles the chicha and oats to make the containers more hygienic. The biggest challenge of her job is that it is very exhausting: she gets up at 3.20 each morning and at 9pm each night she still hasn't finished. Martina dreams of having her own home and own place of business so that she doesn't have to go out in the streets. She also wants her son to finish studying: he has entered in various colleges but has had to quit due to exhaustion-related reasons due to the work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She lives in Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. \r\n\r\nJosephine is  borrowing PHP 11,000 as an additional working capital for her general store business. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Josephine aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With the help of her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nenita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 4,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,800, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000  to buy more palm toddy to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future for the education of her only child.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":768353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She started her business with capital from her husband who had saved money from his income in another paint shop for them to start their own. With her Kiva loan, Jennie will be buying paint and other supplies needed for the shop. She also has additional income from a plot of land she farms on and part of her loan will be used to buy fertilizer and to rent a tractor for the fields.

Para ello, alquil\u00f3 chacras donde siembra los meses de enero y julio, para cosechar en las fechas claves, llegando a vender cada paquete de 12 docenas en 70 u 80 soles, pasadas estas fechas baja el precio hasta 20 soles por paquete. Entonces en esas \u00e9pocas se dedica a sus cultivos de papa y arveja hasta el mes de octubre, donde nuevamente suben los precios de las flores. Aunque a veces debido a la sequ\u00eda demoran en reventar los capullos, trata de contrarrestar este problema regando por las noches para facilitar el florecimiento de sus chacras. Delfina se siente muy contenta en la siembra y venta de flores y para que las trasporte sin maltratarse hasta el mercado, las envuelve cuidadosamente con papeles y rafia que guarda para la ocasi\u00f3n. Este es su d\u00e9cimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y en todos estos ciclos demostr\u00f3 puntualidad en cada uno de sus pagos. Asimismo viene cumpliendo con mucha responsabilidad su cargo de tesorera de su banco comunal, donde se ha ganado el aprecio y respeto de todos sus compa\u00f1eros. El dinero que solicita lo piensa utilizar en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para sus siembras de flores, para que coseche en el mes de octubre.  ","en":"Delfina is 40 years old, a very responsable woman who lives with the father of her 2 children in her own house. Before she used to sew potato and pea, but 2 years ago she also started sewing flowers (gladiolus) which are very profitable during the holidays. Therefore she rented land where she sews in the months of January and July in order to harvest on the key dates, thus being able to sell each packet of 12 dozen for 70 or 80 soles. After these dates the price is 20 soles per packet. During the low seasons she sews potato and pea until the month of October where the price of the flowers raise again. Sometimes the draught delays the flowers but then she waters them at night to facilitate the flowering on her land. Delfina is very happy sewing and selling flowers and in order to transport them safely to the market she wraps them carefully with paper and raffia which she keeps for the occasion. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she has always made the repayments punctually. She also carries out her post as treasurer of her community bank with responsibility and has earned the esteem and respect of her partners. The money will be spent on buying chemical fertilizers for the flowres so she can harvest in the month of October.\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":349717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-10T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":394.29,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080950},{"amount":394.29,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734002},{"amount":203.62,"local_amount":619.71,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":620.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123981},{"amount":157.8,"local_amount":480.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":480.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959562}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T13:19:22Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":125025,"name":"Aishat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aishat sells drinks, detergent, provisions, and other items.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Gaudencio has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gaudencio joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gaudencio has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from GDMPC. Gaudencio is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional feeds. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Gaudencio from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

He is 42 years old. Samuel is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Samuel L.'s Group.\r\n\r\nSamuel is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Samuel raises pigs for fattening and sale. Samuel has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Samuel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Samuel is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the first loan taken out by Samuel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

venture: dried fish and general store  businesses.  She lives in  Brgy.Tagbino, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her dried fish vending and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000.  Juanita is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she  can continue to  purchase more dried fish to sell.   This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of Php 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nJuanita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

brave. Erlinda C., 66, does just that. Erlinda is only an elementary school graduate but right now she manages her own micro business as she learns entrepreneurship as a community partner in CCT*. She is a widow, and takes care of her four children, who are all working.\r\n\r\nErlinda runs her own sari-sari (variety) store, located in the extension of their house. Everyday she observes the buying patterns of her customers and notes down their preferences in terms of the type of item they buy, the price, and the brand. She sees to it that her customers get what they deserve. Monthly, Erlinda earns Php11,000 on average.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan.  She intends to meet the demands of her customers.  As needed, she will buy more stocks of rice, soft drinks, and other grocery items. \r\n\r\nErlinda acknowledges that no challenges are too hard to deal with.  She knows that the Lord will enable her to overcome, and  will uphold the future of both her children and her business. She dreams of making her sari-sari store grow.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now at 40 years old, and with great effort, she\u2019s been able to finish building her house. In spite of the circumstances, she worked very hard to finish this house, which is beautiful and large; it has three floors and is adequately furnished. But since it\u2019s not very pleasant living alone in a very large house, she began renting out rooms to single women, in this way she has an income which helps her meet her expenses. She\u2019s been renting rooms for six years now. She has a field to the side of her house that she wants to build on and broaden her renting services. But, for the moment she wants to furnish the rooms to better accommodate the guests, who provide warmth to every part of the house. This motivates her to pursue her dream of getting married one day and creating a home with children she hopes to have. Rosana is opening her first individual loan with MFP, the pervious were group loans which helped her to get acquainted with people in the financial world.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ena has 2 years of experience in this business.  Ena needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ena joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ena's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNanita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Nanita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Nanita has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nanita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nanita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nanita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Lahore is the capital city of Punjab Province. It is also known for its history, gardens, culture, and food. \r\n<p>\r\nAaster lives in Nishat Colony which is near the Cantt area. She is 42 years old, and married to I. G., who is an electrician by profession. He not only does electrical repair work but also operates a shop in the market where he sells electrical supplies to his customers. His business is doing very well and he earns a good income every month. \r\n<p>\r\nAaster lives in a three-room brick house with her husband and five children: three girls and two boys. All of them are getting their education. The two eldest children have completed their school education and are now studying in college, while the other three are still in school and studying in the 9th, 4th, and 2nd standard, respectively. \r\n<p>\r\nOver the years Aaster has proved herself to be a great mother and housewife, who not only takes care of her children very well, but has also made her house into a home with her good management skills. She supports her family financially by doing embroidery for her neighboring clients.

During the harvest, Ana travels with her daughter to the city of Tarma and to the capital of the country, where she sells her products to the different purchasers. \r\n\r\nFor his part, Juan and his son work in public transportation. Every day using the 3 automobiles they own, they transport inhabitants along the Tarma - Yaroka route. It provides them good income because the area is nearby and the citizens constantly need to go to the city to do their activities.\r\n\r\nAna wants to continue working and planting more each day. Ana is a responsible woman and a fighter. Every loan payment with MFP gives incentive to the members to get ahead. This is Ana\u2019s eighth loan, and she would like to continue working to achieve her goals. With the requested loan, she will be able to purchase organic fertilizer for the cultivation of gladiolas, and similarly, will be able to hire help to plow her fields, where she is planning on planting carrots and spinach. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":641880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase organic fertilizer for the cultivation of gladiolas and to hire field hands for planting carrots and spinach","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-19T16:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3004.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195746}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T01:01:59Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":252917,"name":"Zubaida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zubaida is married to M.

Crispina  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Crispina  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizer for her rice field to save up for future improvements of her business. Crispina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Nevertheless, she has always had the strength to get ahead, and to continue progressing with her family. Jane is a wise farmer, whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past 20 years she has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Jane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making a profit selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Jane mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy another motorbike. Jane is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market in order to fetch a high price. With this loan, Jane is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Jane feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Jane will suffer fewer losses due to delays in the delivery of her produce to the market.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":5810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Fishing equipment purchase","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Palmerin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-11-30T01:28:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saliou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-14T15:34:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":181,"local_amount":181,"processed_date":"2007-02-09T19:41:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":181,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7149},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-03-12T18:29:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10073},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T21:59:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13112},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16916},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16932},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16948},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:57:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16964},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:42:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34429},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:13:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41475},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63336},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80044},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93780},{"amount":91,"local_amount":91,"processed_date":"2007-12-11T13:31:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":95471}],"funded_date":"2006-11-30T15:34:23Z","paid_date":"2007-12-11T13:31:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6249,"name":"Emi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emi, a member of MBK, is requesting for a loan of $100.

Since then, she borrowed more money to expand her breeding plan. Her income from breeding pigs increased over years and as a result, she was able to send her children to school. Currently, her family income is 330 USD\/month. Because of her successful business, in 2004, Mrs. N. was able to have her own well-furnished house built.

By forming a committee they could access loans quickly and easily which is useful for all of the jobs that they carry out. In the beginning, the committee encountered many difficulties in their organization, and although all of the members are neighbors there were people who could not adapt to working as a team and had to separate themselves from the organization.  Today San Miguel has accomplished a full integration of all of its members and an excellent organization, with which the loan amount of increased each day allowing them to work with a greater quantity of capital. All of the committee members are mothers and homemakers and each day they work to increase the incomes of the households and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nIn the attached photograph Lorenza V. and Isacia F. do not appear.
