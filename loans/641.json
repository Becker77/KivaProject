cuando posteriormente los clientes aumentaron sus pedidos de mercanc\u00eda, ten\u00edan que esperar hasta recoger sus cuentas por cobrar para responderles, as\u00ed muchas veces dejaron de ser oportunos y por eso recurrieron a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo buscando recursos para financiarse.  Hoy su esposo trabaja de mensajero  en una empresa, pero tambi\u00e9n gestiona la venta de mercanc\u00eda que Karen vende entre sus compa\u00f1eros de trabajo, ayud\u00e1ndola  a conseguir mucha clientela de sus conocidos.  Karen ha recibido 2 cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n en la l\u00ednea de capital de trabajo, con ellos ha podido aumentar sus utilidades porque tiene m\u00e1s venta debido a que con este dinero pudo comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda y hacer una oferta  diversificada; en la actualidad  solicita su tercer cr\u00e9dito por valor de $ 2.200.000 para comprar ropa, calzado e interiores para damas caballeros y ni\u00f1os, tendidos para camas, para lo cual viajar\u00e1 a  Barranquilla, ciudad a dos horas de Cartagena, porque incluyendo transporte su mercanc\u00eda  sale a un mejor costo y puede venderla a un precio adecuado entre sus clientes.\nCon su  negocio Karen se siente \u00fatil para los planes futuros que tienen ella y su esposo, porque sabe que pude lograr el sue\u00f1o de adquirir su vivienda propia y  piensa que puede tambi\u00e9n tener un local al lado de su casa. Su gran desaf\u00edo es terminar los estudios  y con su esposo tener un  gran almac\u00e9n de ropa y brindar a los hijos que planean,  un futuro prometedor.\nKaren se siente contenta, vive en un barrio que fue producto de invasi\u00f3n pero entre todos los vecinos  se organizaron y lograron  acceder a todos los servicios p\u00fablicos y especialmente a la pavimentaci\u00f3n de sus calles que hace f\u00e1cil el acceso a su negocio.\n\n","en":"Karen Bar\u00f3n B., age 26, lives in the Altos de San Isidro neighborhood of the city of Cartagena de Indias, within the municipality of Bol\u00edvar.  She began her business with a small amount of capital that she obtained from temporary work during school vacations.  She also paid high school fees with her earnings because, beginning when she was very young, she did business with her classmates.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she married her husband (standing next to her in the photo) he sent friends from his job to her as customers.  Once, when he became unemployed, he began working with her for a year, and the couple continued to produce profits.  They were selling from door-to-door and neighborhood-to-neighborhood, and they say they got to know and win over many customers.\r\n<p>\r\nLater, when customers increased their orders for merchandise they had to wait until they had collected on their accounts in order to fill them.  As a result, many times they lost opportunities.  Because of this, they resorted to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, looking for resources to finance themselves.  Today, her husband works as a messenger in a business, but he also tries to sell Karen's merchandise to his fellow employees, helping her to get more business from among his acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nKaren has received two loans from Fundaci\u00f3n for working capital.  With these she was able to increase her earnings because she had more sales due to the fact that she was able to buy more merchandise and offer greater diversity.  Currently, she is applying for her third loan for 2,200,000 Columbian pesos in order to purchase clothing, footwear, and underwear for ladies, gentlemen and children.  For these she will travel to Barranquilla, a city two hours from Cartagena, because, even including transportation, she can obtain her merchandise at a better price there and can sell it at a good price to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her business Karen feels good about the future plans that she and her husband have because she knows that they can succeed in their dream of acquiring their own home, and she thinks that she can also have a shop next to their house.  Her great challenge is to finish her schooling and with her husband have a large clothing store and offer the children they plan to have a promising future.\r\n<p>\r\nKaren feels contented.  She lives in a neighborhood that was informally settled but all the neighbors organized themselves and succeeded in obtaining public services and especially the paving of their streets, which makes access to her business easy.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

She owns a business venture, raising fish for sale.  Tina  has many years of experience in this business.  Tina  needs a loan of WST $1500 purchase fishing gears and a new canoe.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tina  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tina 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tina  P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her loan from ASHI is her main source of financial support. The profit from her business provides her family with food and other basic needs because this  is the only income source for both her and her husband. \r\n\r\nSince she started receiving loans from ASHI in 2004, her business has grown and she has been able to support the needs of her four children, particularly their educational needs. Soon, her eldest will go to college and her second child is in secondary school. They will need much financial support until they graduate from college. Therefore, Rowena really wants her business to become stable and to increase the family income while her two youngest children are still in elementary school. She is requesting a much larger loan from ASHI to help finance her aspirations for the business. \r\n\r\nWith hope that, someday, she will fully achieve her dream of lifting her family above poverty, Rowena is very enthusiastic about managing her business well, in partnership with her loving husband.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":519689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is 35 years old. Marlon is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarlon is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Marlon owns & operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector operating a furniture making business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Marlon has been engaged in his business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marlon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlon is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marlon from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a married woman who lives in Daan bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: tailoring and a general store.  Her husband, Pablito, who is 49 years old, works as a tailor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are between 11 to 21 years old. Enrequita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Enrequita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000.  She intends to use it to buy materials for the sewing machine so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and the improvement of her home & store. Enrequita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is Shamim M., a 39-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is a widow with four children, who are between the ages of 14 and 20 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nShamim M. has been operating a charcoal sales business since 1998. Notably, many Tanzanians use charcoal for fuel to cook their daily meals; indeed, women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light the charcoal. Fortunately, there is a high demand for charcoal across the country, so charcoal-selling is quite a lucrative profession. She works at her business 16 hours per day, 7 days per week, though she notes that she receives assistance from one employee. In doing so, Shamim currently earns approximately $440 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to purchase more charcoal for resale purposes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Shamim thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

the past two years.  It's extremely exhausting work and the pay is not great, but it meets her family's needs.  She is 46-years-old and lives in Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n in the city of Managua.  In the past she had worked for herself as a street vendor selling pork products, but in the end she could not sell as much as she needed to so she closed the business.  He husband is a truck driver, which does not pay enough to cover their expenses, so they both have to work. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan they are seeking from AFODENIC. The loans, which they've been using to finish their house and do home improvements, have been very beneficial to them.  They plan to use this loan to buy a toilet and the materials to install it, so the family can have a decent bathroom and enjoy better hygiene.   Their future plans include starting their own business, and having the means to help their children obtain a better education.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":255407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy a toilet and the matierials to install it.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.81,"local_amount":339.63,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":395.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351574},{"amount":19.47,"local_amount":333.8,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":389.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038911},{"amount":19.04,"local_amount":326.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":380.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929207},{"amount":20.93,"local_amount":358.79,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":418.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384119},{"amount":17.96,"local_amount":307.87,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":358.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890581},{"amount":21.5,"local_amount":368.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":429.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111880},{"amount":17.37,"local_amount":298.05,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":347.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533295},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":388.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964673},{"amount":19.48,"local_amount":333.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":388.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875141}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T18:46:39Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":87821,"name":"Noemi Marcelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Noem\u00ed es madre de cuatro hijos, dos de ellos aun viven con ella y con su esposo.

She lives in the house that her parents left her, and she has a drive to move ahead and giver her son a good education. She believes education is a very important aspect in the life of a child, and for this reason she decided to start a school for special children (with Down's Syndrome or mental retardation), as she feels that we all deserve the opportunity to have a good education. She is very happy and carefully tends to her \"Loves\", as she calls the children who study in her Educational Institution. She really enjoys her work, and is very happy teaching children. She has been working in this field for seven years, and the most difficult part is taking care of her students during unforeseen circumstances.

She is 52 years old with two children: Melquiades, age 19, and a daughter, age 25.  Irma is engaged in the making and selling of tortillas every day, and in the afternoons she makes small snacks that people in El Salvador cannot do without.  \r\n<p>\r\nIrma has a very stable clientele since she has been working for years and is well known in the area.  The loan that Irma is applying for is for the purchase of basic materials since she wants to increase her production and offer them in more places in order to succeed in obtaining greater

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has been doing this for 16 years and finds the most difficult thing about it is transporting her goods to the various city markets.  In the future, she would like to have a store where she could sell her merchandise with greater ease and she\u2019s willing to work hard to achieve this.  \r\n\r\nThis is Jacinta\u2019s sixth loan with MFP, she knows she has to pay her installments on time and she promises to do so.  She is well loved and respected in her communal bank since she always keeps the meetings running smoothly.

She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Faima  has many years of experience in this business.  Faima  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faima  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faima 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faima  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She hopes to further improve her fishing business through hard work and with continuous support from ASHI and the Kiva Partner.\n\nDue to a lack of business capital, she was encouraged to seek financial support from Kiva lenders.

Her hard work and patience are her foundation to achieve a better life. \n\nThe income she earns from the business is very helpful, as it supports her business and sustains the needs of her family, especially by providing school allowances for her only son, Romeo, a high school student. She hopes that someday she will be able to expand her fishing business. Rosalie is glad to have the secure opportunity to request this loan and for your support and encouragement. \n\nHer long-term goal is to have a fish farm so that she can offer support to others in her village, especially her relatives.

The income that they earn from this business really helps her to sustain their basic needs. Though some of her children who already work help support her, sometimes it is not enough for their needs, especially if there are unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nNally is one of the pioneer members of the branch. She has been a member for 11 years in ASHI and has already received several awards for being a good member. The Institution really helps her because through ASHI, some of her children have already finished their studies and have a stable job, and she has a tricycle.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, she is planning to expand her store and to purchase again an additional motorcycle. These projects are very useful not only for her, but also to her children who do not have any source of income.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream in life is to have a decent house and to have savings for the

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling seafood products  including fish, milkfish, and sardines  in the local community. Emerita has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emerita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Emerita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. \r\n\r\nEmerita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 Philippines pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products, like milkfish and mackerel, to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Emerita from HSPFI.

At this time, she is working hard to continue to provide income for her children's everyday expenses as well as their schooling. Marcela believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMarcela operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals only during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nHer regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Aside from the food stall, she sells frozen food like hot dogs and ham. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,690 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, as well as frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarcela dreams of giving all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. \r\n\r\nShe faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

She gets good earnings from this business.  In addition, she has a stall for selling beauty products to customers that already know her.\r\n<p>\r\nHer businesses are doing well. \u201cI sold a lot of meat during the festivals,\u201d she says.  That\u2019s why she plans on opening a \u201cchicharroner\u00eda\u201d (a restaurant where pork dishes are sold).  She lacks very little in order to achieve this goal.\r\n<p>\r\nEstrella belongs to the IDME communal bank, and this is her twenty-fourth loan with MFP.

In addition, she is thankful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible and supportive.  Upon receiving her loan, Estrella will invest the money applied for in renting her new restaurant, as well as in purchasing dishes and other utensils needed for selling meals.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":912134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to rent a place for her restaurant and purchase dishes and utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":345.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":373.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":379.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":401.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.63,"local_amount":345.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":359.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621958},{"amount":143.04,"local_amount":373.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":387.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836032},{"amount":145.54,"local_amount":379.65,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":393.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245792},{"amount":153.79,"local_amount":401.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:37Z","rounded_local_amount":416.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385825}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T19:25:21Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":359138,"name":"Miriam Yanina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirian tiene un Bodega, el pr\u00e9stamo que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar y fideos al por mayor.

Chincha is named after the Chincha culture, famous for its advanced agricultural innovation and its heroic deeds at sea.  Today Chincha is an incredible mix of cultures, with a large Afro-Peruvian population, resulting from what is left of an indigenous past and the influences of the Spanish empire.  The city, along with other cities near the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007, years in which strong earthquakes occurred, but has continued on as it always has through its history.  \r\n\r\nRoric lives with his mother and at 23 years old he has his own business selling Salchipollo (a food consisting of french fries and pieces of fried chicken which is accompanied by various sauces).  Three years ago he got up the courage to have this type of business thanks to his mother since he has helped in her food stand, and after much effort and dedication he was able to save enough money to form his own business.  Roric, in spite of the difficult nature of his work and his young age, has his own cooking utensils and his own salchipollo cart, from which he sells his products outside of the rural bank \"Se\u00f1or de Luren\".  It is there that he can be contacted, since there are always people wanting to buy his food because they it is so delicious.  He is not timid and always shows kindness to his customers, as he is of the opinion that that kindness and the care with which he prepares his products causes him to have such a good clientele.  \r\n\r\nRoric is very grateful to those who give Kiva loans because thanks to their help he will be able to purchase more supplies and cooking utensils to make his business better and in turn better his quality of life.

He usually takes orders from his clients before he buy the items. He said that he has been in this business for more than five years. He is ambitious about becoming a big wholesaler in his area one day. He is in need of USD 550 to replenish his stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":48709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To purchase different consumables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":10,"posted_date":"2007-07-13T17:09:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Twaha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-07-27T22:36:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T09:15:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47278},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-09-28T09:15:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59652},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-10-28T10:15:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73023},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-11-28T10:15:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87854},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-12-28T10:16:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103930},{"amount":90,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2008-01-28T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-29T10:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123079}],"funded_date":"2007-07-13T22:36:35Z","paid_date":"2008-01-28T10:16:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18181,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"LAPO has given me voice,\" says Mrs. Rose O. whose business is stable and profitable.

Thi Bao, 35 years old, has 3 school-going children. Before joining the TYM Fund, she stayed at home to raise livestock and take care of the children, thus her family relied mainly on her husband's income. Therefore, they faced many difficulties. She joined the Fund in 1995 and borrowed loans to start a business. She used the first few loans to get used to doing business by selling fresh bamboo shoot. After 10 years of membership, she now has a small shop selling foodstuffs in the market. Besides managing the shop, she also works for various local processed-meat production companies so her family's income is very stable. Her husband works as a driver, earning 3,000,000VND (about 193USD) per month. Her children can all go to school. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150USD) to invest in her food shop. Her family's monthly income is 7,000,000VND (about 451USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3o n\u0103m nay 35 tu\u1ed5i.

This is Frida M., a 26-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has two children, who are both 3 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nFrida M. has been running a stationary business since 2006. The stationary sales business allows micro-entrepreneurs to demonstrate their business savvy; to illustrate, most such entrepreneurs place their shops, stalls, or tables strategically close to post offices, banks, schools, and universities in order to generate as much income as possible. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week. By doing so, Frida is able to earn approximately $300 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy a printer and additional paper to better meet her customers' demands. In the future, she plans to increase her inventory of stationary. Frida thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Secretarial Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To meet customer demand by purchasing a printer and additional paper","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T19:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436337},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130609},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027406},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613407},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010487},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232786},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664602},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105333},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022478},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867728}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T19:39:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83741,"name":"Ana Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana is a member of the Las Entusiastas (\u201cThe Enthusiasts\u201d) Village Bank.

Hakik is a dynamic and ambitious 50-year-old woman. She is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nFor three years, Hakik has had a small business processing and drying apricots. Thanks to the quality of her products and the experience she gained in this sphere of business, she has earned a solid reputation among her customers. Accordingly, the demand for her goods has grown, allowing her to contribute significantly to the household.\r\n\r\nNow, Hakik requests 900 USD to spend on purchasing apricots which she will dry and resell. She hopes that she will continue sending her children to school so that they will be able to get an adequate education. She expresses her gratitude to everyone supporting her.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Constance was born on October 22, 1978 in Niger, a country neighboring Benin.  She is married and the mother of two children who are both in school.  She lives in her father\u2019s house in Fifadji, a district of Cotonou. Constance attended school but did not finish primary school.  Sewing is what she finally learned as her trade.  Yet she worked in this trade for only a few years and finally came to devote all her time to commerce.  She used to sell food in front of her house.  But today, it\u2019s grains, corn in particular.  Constance has already had three different ALID\u00e9 business loans.  She\u2019s requesting this fourth loan for bolstering her working capital and for growing her business in grains.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":388574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy four 100-kg sacks of corn ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-09-16T00:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constance","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14285.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14285.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896197},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735777},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623288},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019993},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858486},{"amount":32.16,"local_amount":14285.71,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618638},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":14285.74,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":14428.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144652699}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T01:22:32Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":141150,"name":"Mrs. Vorn Sok Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of six people who all live in Smaong Village in Takeo province.

The three children are currently studying so creating more expenses, especially her two older children who are in college. Rosario helps Eugenio in providing for their family through the income from buying and selling various frozen foods. Sometimes she sells some beauty products, and also offers her customers pedicures or manicures, treatment for their hair, a spa for their feet, and facial treatments.<P>\r\n\r\nHer 7th loan from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) is will be used in buying what is needed for these businesses: frozen foods and  beauty products and for her other business, nail polish, things used in treating hair, face, and feet. She is sure after buying all this, she will get a big boost in income because these are all the things that help her in improving her businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nThe education of her children is her priority in life, so she will do everything to make her businesses grow.

Her greatest desire is to improve their quality of life.  She sells papayas in the Las Mercedes (Juliaca's most important market) market.  Her husband brings the papayas from the city of Puerto Maldonado (a city on the Brazilian border).  Her stand is very popular because her papayas are fresh and juicy and this has attracted many customers.  What Luz most likes about her job is being able to chat with her fellow merchants because that makes the long work days much more pleasant.  She has been in this line of work for 8 years and considers the most difficult part of it having to stay at her post all day long not being able to go out anywhere.  She hopes that, in time, her business will grow and produce better earnings.  This is Luz's 9th loan with MFP.  She knows that she must make all her repayments on time if she wants to have access to future loans and she is willing to do so.  The 2000 soles requested will be used to buy more papayas in order to have better selection of merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":436736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase stock inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":137.19},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":141.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":146.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.24},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":159.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":162.93},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":166.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":176.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":178.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":188.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":193.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":198.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.02},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.71,"local_amount":279.18,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":281.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734872},{"amount":51.44,"local_amount":146.96,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":148.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124196},{"amount":52.58,"local_amount":150.24,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":151.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992781},{"amount":55.67,"local_amount":159.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":160.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992782},{"amount":57.02,"local_amount":162.93,"processed_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":164.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717571},{"amount":58.11,"local_amount":166.02,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751246},{"amount":61.83,"local_amount":176.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":178.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933796},{"amount":62.59,"local_amount":178.83,"processed_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":180.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672698},{"amount":65.89,"local_amount":188.26,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":189.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886595},{"amount":137.16,"local_amount":391.89,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153755}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T00:58:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":161818,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is fifty-one years old.

Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a fishing \/ fish vending business.  Her husband Vicente B., who is 50 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 4 to 19 years old.  One of their children has their own family. Another one works and the other seven are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJudy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Judy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,900, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy fishnet so that she can continue to save up for the future and the business. \r\n\r\nJudy B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own house with her husband Severo, 40, and their 3 children, in the village of Picoy.  Early every morning, Yanet goes out to work in her fields, since she knows that the prices she gets for the vegetables she grows (such as potatoes and peas) depend on the quality of her products.  She sells her products at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma, where she can get the best price for them. She loves cultivating her land and has been doing it with her husband for 25 years.  The hardest part is transporting the products to market.  Over time, she would like buy more land so as to increase her production.  She has also begun selling clothing and accessories made from recyclable materials, such as bottles, boxes, popsicle sticks, and so on.  She sells these at a stall in the indoor market in Tarma. She is also planning to start making ceramics this month, and she is sure to succeed, thanks to her good character and her innate creativity.  \r\n\r\nYanet counts on your support to continue her work.

Georgina has been in this business for five years.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works Monday through Sunday from home but also at the open fairs.  Georgina has many customers.  Her merchandise is purchased in the city of Santiago and then shipped.  She deposits the money and the merchandise (bundles of used clothing) is shipped to the bus terminal in the city of Talca.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan she will buy accessories and toys, products that she will sell exclusively for the Christmas season.  In addition, she will buy a cooler so that she can sell ice cream treats and beverages during the summer at the fair.  Her goals include buying a truck so that she can transport her merchandise.  She currently uses a tricycle, but sometimes she will rent a vehicle, which requires sacrifice and cost.\r\n<p>\r\nGeorgina lives with her husband and two children, age 9 and 6.  Her dreams on a personal level include establishing a store in her house, which would allow her to spend more time at home to look after her children.  Another goal is to prosper her business so that she can provide a better quality of life for her family and pay for her children\u2019s higher education.  \r\n<p>\r\nGeorgina is very grateful for the support Fondo Esperanza has provided.  She says that she would not have a business without it because the assistance she received enabled her to invest in merchandise.  Her Communal Bank group is very close and responsible.

Some say that the phrase was originally attributed to an Englishman who said, \u201cTalca feels like London\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city during winter, just like in the United Kingdom.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":937984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy accessories and toys to sell for the Christmas season and a cooler for selling ice cream treats and beverages at the fairs.

After joining the Fund and being lent to some money, she had a starting fund to do business on waste materials. This activity requires more work and effort but it brings her more profit. Her husband and son also work and earn 150 USD\/month. Since her business goes well and together with the contribution of her husband and son, she is able to repay regularly.

He is a humble farmer, who has worked on the tasks of the farm since he was a child.  Now he works selling and buying animals for a profit, which has given him what he needs to meet the expenses of his family.  For this, with his own hands he built a stable in order to keep his animals inside.  Later, over several months of careful feeding he sells them in the markets, where he goes with his entire family.  He also works growing corn and potatoes in small quantities, but he has more land in alfalfa with which he feeds his animals.  Herminio works to meet the responsibility of supporting his family; this is his reason to be.  He asks for this loan, with which he would be able to prepare his lands for farming with fertilizer, and to grow alfalfa.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her partner \u00c1ngel, who is 42 years old and a construction worker.\r\n<p>\r\nFor three years, Dina has managed a small bookstore out of her home.  She says she started this business because there was no other bookstore nearby and thought it would be very profitable since she would not have any competition.  Dina also sells other products from the same retail space.  She enjoys her work because it allows her to be independent.  In addition, she can work out of the comfort of her own home and spend time with her children who still need her.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Dina wants to have a larger store that is stocked with various products to offer.  She intends to have more space so that she can sell groceries and toiletries such as soaps and toothpastes, as well as detergents and other items.  By expanding her business, Dina hopes she can meet the needs of her customers.    \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Faleupolu  has 5 years of experience in this business.  Faleupolu  needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase new items to expand product offering.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nFaleupolu  joined SPBD.This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faleupolu 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faleupolu  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This will be her sixth loan from GDMPC.

Tuburan, Brgy Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fish vending business. Her husband Federico E., who is 55 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have 10 children, who are between the ages of 12 and 33. Maria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to purchase fishing nets for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family. Maria E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married and has two children. His wife is a housekeeper, and the business of Hasan is the main source of income of his large family. Hasan has been providing transportation services for the last 13 years. Usually, he transports cargo from Dushanbe to Pamir. Hasan dreams that all of his children will be well educated, so he works hard. As a result, the business generates a significant income that allows him to support his large family. In order to provide better service for his clients and earn more, Hasan needs to make major repairs to his lorry. He believes that this will make his business more profitable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pisa needs a loan of 2,200 Somoa Tala (WST) to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400WST or US$167 per week) to financially support members of her immediate family.\n\nPisa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Pisa fifth loan with SPBD. \n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

All the members are businesswomen in Makeni, the northern provincial headquarters town. They have been a group with SMT for the past two years now and are now in their fourth cycle. Previously, SMT loaned these women Le 600,000.00 each. This they have repaid successfully, and they are now requesting a new loan. The previous loan made a big difference in their lives, but they still need more loans to further empower themselves in their businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group leader is Marian C.. Marian was born in Magburaka, Tonkolili District, in northern Sierra Leone, 38 years ago. She is married with two school-going children, both of whom are in secondary school. Both she and her husband, who is a businessman, are responsible for their children's schooling and welfare. Through her groundnut trade, Marian is able to meet most of her financial needs. She has been in the groundnut business for the past 15 years. Marian is doing fine in her business, but she still faces a lot of challenges. First, the amount that SMT's credit officer approved for her and her group members is not enough. She had wanted Le 1,000,000.00. This would have enabled her to purchase more bags of groundnuts, and as the dry seasoning is fast approaching, she expects a boom in business. Second, sometimes some of the groundnuts within a bag may be rotten, which means some losses for her business. However, with this loan of Le 800,000.00 approved for Marian, she will be able to buy at least three bags of groundnuts to add to her current stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":208636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To expand their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasratu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T22:37:37Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":320000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968643},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885030},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:55:37Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434492},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128845},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025635},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611577},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:52:27Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008439},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:18Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230795},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662578},{"amount":110,"local_amount":320000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":321750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102818}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T21:37:37Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:19:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosana Francescato","image":28098}},{"id":71485,"name":"Meas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Meas C. was born in 1949 and lives in Trapeang Krasang Village in Takeo Province.

After a while she has learned the trade & gained experience in this domain, she and her family had decided to get a loan to start a new business: buy pigs from other entrepreneurs and resell to companies who make frozen food. They also retail pork at the market. Their business is good, they earn a good income at 4.000.000 VND a month.

I am applying for a loan to buy construction supplies so that my husband is able to complete his customers' orders.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m the group leader of four other women from my area. Irshad baji wants a loan to buy items (tables, table covers  and chairs) for her catering business. Rafia baji wants a loan to change the body of her auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). Sugran baji wants a loan to buy timber to sell. Parveen Kosar baji wants a loan to buy tea packets to sell. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":327674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

This is a new business she started four months ago, and she is successful due to her cleanliness and friendly nature at work. Florence dreams of expanding her business and getting a much bigger place, as well as buying her own plot of land.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u1ea3n M\u1ed7 1 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\nC. is married and has two adult children.  To make a living, C. operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  The main source of income for the business comes from raising chickens for sale.  C. has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately $112 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003, C. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  C. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.300.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5.886.000 VND which will be used in the same way.  This will be her sixth loan from SEDA.

Eight of the children already have their own families. The remaining two are single and help their parents in the business.\r\n\r\nAmparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family.

Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAmparo is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 12,500 was used to fund operations of her general store and sugarcane farm, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 18th loan in the amount of PHP 13,500, which she intends to use on her general store and sugarcane farm.  Amparo is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She will repay the loan in 5 installments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":228872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy livestock (1 cow)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yunguyo-Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.25 -69.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-11-22T02:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111056},{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006352}],"funded_date":"2008-12-02T16:39:06Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:15:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":79693,"name":"En","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"En H. is 49-year-old resident in Kompong Tom Province.

She lives in Ntamulung quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon. L. and her entire family live in a house with eight rooms, one sitting room and a kitchen. Being a very hard working woman, L. had to overcome some challenges in life such as taking care of her children, especially as she is living in her parents house. It is not easy for her living there with other family members and children.\r\n\r\nL. runs a call centre, an embroidery business and also sells food supplements  in front of their compound with the support of her children. She plans to invest this loan in her existing businesses of call centre, food supplement and embroidery. She plans to expand these businesses since she has been doing them for a number of years. \r\n\r\nThis will be L.\u2019s fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2005. She has been quite successful in the past with her businesses due to her location (right on the main road), the quality of her products, and her reasonable prices. Also, with her experience, she is now having more customers who buy her products.\r\n \r\nPart of her profits from this loan will be used to buy a plot where she will construct a house in the future for her and the children. And another part will be used to improve her farm. L. does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments every month. She intends to start repayment in the fourth month after taking the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her group is located in the urban slums surrounding Santiago, a city known for its tobacco production, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their three children.\r\n\r\nAnita is excited to be taking out her fourth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business running a colmado, or small general store, by stocking rice, beans, cooking oil, spaghetti, sauces, and flour as well as a freezer in which to store goods. She will use the profits to save towards her dream of one day opening a supermarket.

Rosevilla has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosevilla joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosevilla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Rosevilla is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing supplies for their boat. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Rosevilla from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
