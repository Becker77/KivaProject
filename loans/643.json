For the past two years, Robert has been working hard to manage his bar and lodge, which sells drinks and sodas to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Robert has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to construct more rooms in his bar, and will help Robert to generate greater profits and improve his family's welfare. Robert hopes that in the future he will be able to develop even more rooms on the lodge side of his bar. \r\n\r\nRobert is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Robert who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":904740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Mubashira has had her own business for 12 years. She runs a clothing business at the clothing market of Istaravshan, Tajikistan. She and her husband have three children - a son and two daughters. Her business is an important source of income for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nMubashira's income helps her to build, little by little, a dowry for her two daughters. They are growing up and will soon be eligible to marry. Lending services from IMON International lent key support for Mubashira as she has developed her business. She has proven to be a great client and has maintained a perfect payment record. Mubashira is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni ($600 USD) to boost her available capital so she can purchase new inventory. We are grateful for the opportunity to further assist in the success of this dedicated entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They each expect to make a monthly profit of 32,250 FCFA,  part of which will be put into savings and to meet the needs of their families, and the rest will be invested in their business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":503172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746534},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779075},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779076},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961278},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699406},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913327}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T04:08:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Arnold","image":null}},{"id":187547,"name":"Ruby","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruby T.

She is 38 years old. Juanita is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJuanita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Juanita owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juanita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Juanita is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Juanita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients can run successful businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a very small farm, but it suffices to cover the expenses of his family. He is hoping that with this loan he will be able to maximize the production of his fields. He has about 25 years of experience in rice farming. He has three children ages 16, 12 and 5 who are all in school. He hopes he can continue to provide for them so they will be able to receive an adequate education. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Edison is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":19390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Plant Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-27T19:51:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:48:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15392},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:24:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21963},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T21:33:32Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29298},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:10:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40397},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:20:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65659},{"amount":405,"local_amount":405,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":405,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66075}],"funded_date":"2007-03-13T19:51:15Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:49:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10537,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene is married and has a 12-year-old child.

In my case, I observed a cheerful environment that involved such riotous laughter at one point that we had to pause briefly before continuing with my interview!  This resulted when I asked for a show of hands from those women present who raised farm animals.  The translator told them to raise their hands if they were animals. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Uk\u00b4Ux Kem ladies are unequalled in their sense of joy, which is reflected in the manner in which they work and use their credit.  It appears all the group members feel a loan helps them better themselves business-wise, given that this increases their working capital and grows their small businesses. <p>\r\n\r\nThe majority of the members invest their loan in fabric.  Many create beautiful traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d.  In addition, they also use the same creative techniques to make cloth napkins, table coverings, and other items for interior decorating.  The other part of the group uses the credit to raise livestock to be sold at the market.  This is a good business in rural areas where large enterprises in this arena have not yet arrived at the markets. <p>\r\n\r\nYou will find several outstanding businesswomen among this group.  For example, Mrs. Candelaria H. told me she was currently employing three women to make cortes, a traditional skirt, and another woman to make cloth napkins.  Mrs. Albina Yiax commented that she raises chickens, and uses their waste to fertilize her maize crop. <p>\r\n\r\nInterviewing this group of women was a pleasure and wonderful assignment because they are hard-working ladies who, despite their difficult situations, keep a lovely smile on their faces.  It is for this reason that you must provide them with your support. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Entrando al lugar de reuni\u00f3n de las mujeres que conforman el grupo Uk\u00b4Ux Kem uno puede sentir la diferencia entre este grupo y un banco comunal promedio. En mi caso, pude sentir un ambiente alegre que se materializ\u00f3 en risa incontrolables que hasta en un punto \u00a1llegaron a ser un breve impedimento para proseguir con la entrevista! Este punto lleg\u00f3 cuando les pe\u00ed a las compa\u00f1eras que levantaran la mano las que criaban animales y la traductora les dijo que levantaron la mano las que son animales.  \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres Uk\u00b4Ux Kem no solo son inigualables en el sentido de la alegr\u00eda que reflejan sino en la manera como trabajan y utilizan el cr\u00e9dito. Al parecer, todas las clientas creen que el cr\u00e9dito las ayuda a superarse empresarialmente, ya que les ayuda a aumentar su capital y por ende agrandar su peque\u00f1o negocio. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de ellas invierten su dinero en tejido. Muchas siguen elaborando bellas blusas t\u00edpicas llamadas huipiles. Asimismo, ellas tambi\u00e9n elaboran usando la misma t\u00e9cnica servilletas, caminos de mesa, entre otras cositas para el interior de las casas. Otro grupo de mujeres utilizan el cr\u00e9dito para criar animales y luego venderlos en el mercado. Este es un buen negocio en las \u00e1rea rurales en donde grandes empresas, dentro de esta industria, todav\u00eda no entran al mercado.  \r\n\r\n<P>En este grupo se puede encontrar varias empresarias destacadas. Por ejemplo Do\u00f1a Candelaria H. cont\u00f3 que ella estaba actualmente contratando a tres mujeres para que tejan cortes, una falda tradicional, y una mujer para que teja servilletas. Do\u00f1a Albina Yiax coment\u00f3 que ella criaba pollos y que las eses fecales son utilizadas para abonar su milpa o cosecha de ma\u00edz.\r\n\r\n<P>Entrevistar a este grupo de mujeres fue un placer y a la misma vez una linda haza\u00f1a porque son personas luchadoras y que a pesar de su dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n ellas mantienen una bella sonrisa. Es por eso ,que se les tiene que apoyar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":156585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband, Salvador, who is 50, and their two sons, Juan, 18, and Frank, 14.  Five years ago, she decided to start a business which she would be able to operate at home, allowing her to take care of her children, who were school aged and needed her help. As a result, she took advantage of the large space available in her home and established a car parking facility, which currently has room for 6 or 7 cars. Her business is profitable and does not take much time, which is very convenient for her. However, Mar\u00eda has recently been thinking about starting another type of business parallel to her current one, such as the sale of natural health products to customers in their homes, which she will undertake in her spare time. Her goal is to save enough money to open a bookstore in the space that she is now using as a garage. She knows that she still has a long way to go toward this goal, but she will not give up her hope of making it a reality soon. \r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's ninth loan with MFP. She and her group have always shown themselves to be very responsible and punctual in their payments, and this is something that makes Mar\u00eda very happy. With the funds she is requesting, she will purchase natural health products so that she can begin selling and distributing them to customers in their homes. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

who has continuously improved her living through her own efforts. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is married to Jose Jerry S. who is presently engaged in fish vending together with his wife. They have 3 children, the oldest of whom is 21 and the youngest of whom is just 9 years old. The family lives in the village of Prk. Balinghoy, Brgy. Malingin Bago City Negros Occidental.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorentina grew up in a very poor family. Her parents could not afford to send their children to school, but she strived hard to support herself and get a proper education by selling fish with her parents to different barangays (villages). \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she got married, she, together with her husband, continued selling fish in her community, neighboring barangays and nearby towns. Because they sold good quality fish, they soon had regular customers in every place they went, selling all their stocks much faster. \r\n<p>\r\nBut even with the ongoing business, they were starting to worry that they might not be able to save enough to send their children to college later on. This propelled Florentina to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could expand her business and be able to buy more fish to sell. Now she earns an average profit of PHP 10,000 per month, good enough to support their family with enough left over to save for her children's higher education.\r\n<p>\r\nFor her previous 9th cycle loan she borrowed Php 15,000 for her business. She was able to repay her loan on time without any delays. She planned to borrow for her 10th cycle loan the same amount of Php 15,000 that she intends to use in her fish vending business. She plans to expand her business. If there is any extra income, she plans to put up a general store and the rest will be saved for children future.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout Kiva's partner NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":397216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Nasreen wants a loan to buy material (betel nuts, betel leaves) for her Pan Shop. (Pan is an Urdu word used for betel leaves in Pakistan.) Asia wants a loan to buy plastic baby toys for her toy-selling business. Shahnaz is the group leader of the afore-mentioned ladies. They all come from a city called Lahore, famous in Pakistan for its historical places and its Punjabi foods. \r\n\r\nShahnaz is a 43-year-old woman. She is an uneducated lady because her parents couldn\u2019t afford her education expenses due to lack of financial resources. She has a two-room brick house in which she has been living with her family for the past 22 years. She has given birth to three children: two boys and one daughter. Her sons work in a gas station on monthly wage.  Her daughter is 16 years old and reads in 9th standard.  Her husband's name is S. A. and he is a driver by profession and drives an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). \r\n\r\nShahnaz is a very hard-working lady. She does embroidery on different items such as tablecloths and pillow covers and sells her embroidery at the market. She does this work to supplement their income. She is applying for a loan to repair her husband\u2019s auto-rickshaw because it\u2019s creating a problem and if it isn\u2019t repaired soon the chances are its engine might seize up which would be a great loss. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n\r\nNote: Shahnaz is seated second from left holding a piece of embroidered

Her dream is to go to college and get a degree in medicine.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":587071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Supplies for multiple businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-21T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Braulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Crisalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo Balvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2860,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":357.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":357.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":359.38},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":359.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":359.38,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":359.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847084},{"amount":718.75,"local_amount":715,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:20Z","rounded_local_amount":718.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113544},{"amount":718.75,"local_amount":715,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":718.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407245},{"amount":359.37,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":359.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388336},{"amount":359.38,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":359.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388337},{"amount":359.37,"local_amount":357.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":359.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682821}],"funded_date":"2010-08-22T16:39:36Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":228532,"name":"Kem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kem Y., who was born in 1962, was selected as the village bank president by the members of this village loan.

Bangon, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Ramon, who is 55 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 18 and 31 years old. \r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to buy stock of goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nWilma B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. \r\n\r\nLiny  is  borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nLiny  aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The group has ten women who are merchants.  The group is located in the community of Villa de Tututepec de Melchor Ocampo.

She sells from home and so that people will come by to buy them she advertises over a loudspeaker.  She has many customers because she sells her product at a very good price and because they are delicious so people buy them well.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy corn and firewood to make tortillas.  She will use the profits obtained from the sales for her children\u2019s education because she wants them to continue in school, at least through high school, and have a better future.  She also wants to be able to make her payments.\r\n\r\nShe is infinitely grateful because she got the loan she requested and because humble people like her are trusted.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the group members:\r\n\r\nTomasa J.

This cycle she is planning to increase her production of 'rellenos de papa' (meat-stuffed potatoes) and 'rellenos de patitas'.  She will use her loan to buy supplies (oil, potatoes, vegetables, etc.) for her business preparing 'rellenos'.

Khomida is a hardworking woman who is married. Her husband is an entrepreneur. She is engaged in dried fruit trading and also in animal husbandry. Khomida has been running her business thanks to Imon International which supported her in improving her dried fruit sales. She successfully repaid her first loan. She plans to use the second one to purchase an apricot garden in Kanibadam.\r\n\r\nFrom her profits she purchased milk cows. She has a barn where she keeps her four cattle. Her daughter-in-law helps her in her business. Her sons are currently working in Russia and, with the money they have been sending her, she purchased a house. This loan will help her to improve her business.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and marking the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This was a great help to these entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nAlpha is the leader of the group. He was born in Kabala 21 years ago. He is single with no children. He has been in business for 3 years now. Alpha dropped out of school when his dad passed away. He became the breadwinner for his family following the death of his father. He started a small business in order to raise money to support his 5 junior brothers in their schooling.

Le gusta mucho esta labor porque conoce a muchas personas con quienes entabla buenas relaciones, adem\u00e1s que le es rentable porque aparte de contar con su propio local, tambi\u00e9n brinda sus servicios a domicilio y cuenta con una fiel clientela. Para m\u00e1s adelante, Carlos quisiera tener un local propio y dejar de pagar alquiler. Es la primera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y le gusta trabajar con su grupo porque sus integrantes son muy responsables y comunicativos. Con el dinero que solicita comprar\u00e1 herramientas y productos para su peluquer\u00eda, adem\u00e1s la ambientar\u00e1 adecuadamente para dar una mejor acogida a sus clientes. ","en":"Carlos is a 34-year-old father who lives with his son and his wife, who agrees with all his goals and supports him 100%. He has owned a hair salon in a small, rented office space for 7 years, providing all sorts of haircuts for men and women. He really likes this field because he gets to meet a lot of people with whom he forms good relationships. Furthermore, this business is profitable because aside from having a business space, he also provides in-home haircut services, and he has loyal customers. In the future, Carlos would like to have his own business space so that he can stop paying rent. This is the first time that he requests a loan from MFP.

J. is a married woman with four children aged between 3 and 14. Her business is located at a very busy market known as Likoni in Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attractions including the Indian ocean white beaches. \r\n\r\nShe sells water to the local people. She has been in business for one year and she says that this business is profitable. She says the major challenge is water supply. When there is shortage of supply to the hawkers, she cannot continue her business. However, she works very hard to keep her business going well.

This motivated him to start various jobs to secure the necessary economic resources. He has finished his third year of undergraduate studies and currently lives with his mother in the village of San Juan Cacahuatepec, called Yuko Sihgva in Mixteco. He has begun to like the world of handicrafts, and for this reason he has made handcrafts and embroidery for 4 years. Otoniel would like this loan to purchase foam, paper mache, different types of paper, strips, blanket fabric, satin, buttons, needles, thread, white glue, and silicone. These are some of the materials that he uses in the making of purses, baskets, details and other items. He tells us that this is his first loan ever, and so he will be very responsible and careful, since his ability to continue with his business depends on it. At the moment, what he would most like would be to strengthen his business, and to have a store where he could sell his products. However, his greatest wish is to continue studying. He wants with all his heart to continue his education, and hopes that this year he will be able to enroll in a school, but without leaving his small business. He thanks Kiva, those who support his project, Fundacion Realidad, and those who are making his dreams possible. He thanks you for your support and confidence in him through this loan.

To support his food and daily needs, W. is dependent on the animals he raised, initialy it was cow farming. However after his wife passed away, W. had to sell his cow to pay for her funeral ceremony cost. Since 2 years ago W. change profession by raising pigs.  With 2 mother pigs, W. could profit nett Rp 350,000 (about $37)\/month. This income was used to pay for his daily food expenses. With a loan from DINARI for Rp 130,000 (about $150) W. wants to buy 1 other mother pig, and the rest to buy animal feed.

She is married to Juan, 46, and they have 8 children, although only 2 of them live with their parents: Sandro, aged 12, and Lisandra, aged 9. They live in their own home, located in the central forest in the native community of Centro Pumpuriani. With her characteristic smile, she has always managed to get ahead. For 25 years she has sold coffee, corn (polenta), bananas, avocados and cassava, and over time she has managed to buy 9 plots of land. She sows in large quantities and depending on the season. She will sow corn and cassava in September, coffee in December and citrus fruits in the Summer. She has already planned her next crops, which will depend on the seasonality of the product demand in the marketplace. \r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys the most is sowing, tending to her crops and selling them to the traders that arrive every week-end to her native community. Her current situation is slightly unstable, as a few months ago her banana plants caught fire and she lost the whole crop, but she does not let this discourage her. On the contrary, she is looking at other ways of getting ahead, and she has already sown young banana plants which she hopes will give good fruits. At the moment her priority is to save up enough capital to build her house in a more resistant material, which will help her provide her children with a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the \"Abejitas de Pumpuriani\" (\"Pumpuriani's Little Bees\") communal bank and this is her fifth loan with MFP. She is happy to know that she will have the necessary financial backing to achieve her goals. Once more, she is committed to repaying the loan as she's done in the past. She also enjoys being part of a community bank because all other members are responsible and very supportive individuals. If she gets your support, Bertha will invest the money in the purchase of several bags of organic compost to distribute it amongst her crops of bananas, cassava and corn, which she will harvest very soon.

In face of that, she decided to open a clothing store and started, in fact, to sell that merchandise to such an extent that her customers remained behind to place specific orders with her.  This led to her going to Lima every two weeks to buy more clothes to reduce costs plus she brings cutting-edge clothes for both genders.

He lives with his two wives and his children in Sanoubougou 1, one of the working-class districts of Sikasso (the Republic of Mali's third administrative region). \r\n\r\nHe was not lucky enough to go to school, and having tried several activities without success, he rapidly launched himself six years ago into selling timber for construction; he buys the wood in towns surrounding Sikasso. Having acquired such experience in this field, he now enjoys a good reputation and gets a lot of orders; however he does not have sufficient resources to satisfy all this demand. He thus decided to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program, and is on his second loan, which will enable him to increase his business so that he can respond better to customer demand. His previous loan has been repaid in full. \r\n\r\nThis second loan will be used to buy 300 planks of construction timber in the towns surrounding Sikasso. Thanks to this loan, he expets to make a monthly profit of 250,000 FCFA. With these profits he is expecting to cover the bulk of his expenses, those of his family and also pay the interest on his loan; the balance will be invested in his main activity.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.
