He is married with 3 adorable children. Aslon has always opted to make his life in his homeland, to work hard and grow with it. That is how he decided to rear sheep and dedicate himself to agriculture. He has been doing this kind of work for a very long time, as he comes from a family with an entirely agricultural background. Today he wishes to increase the number of his animals with the hope of increasing his income and improving the well-being of his home with the innumerable benefits that these special little animals provide him.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":240291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

The members work in different commercial activities such as food sales, clothing sales, chicken sales, and some work at a bakery, a public school, or in a kitchen.  Within the commercial and services fields there is a lot of competition but the experience and the movement of the market lets the members get ahead without problems.  The funds lent by Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital will be used to buy merchandise and repair work materials.  There are some group members who have experience working with supportive groups, so they know how the institutions work and have demonstrated responsible repayment in previous groups.

The milk products are in very high demand in his village. Hiss orders for these products are very high but the milk his cows give is not enough for traders and he decided to apply for $800 USD to purchase an additional cow and fodder.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p> \r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From a young age she worked in sales, working in several jobs that taught her to be a good businesswoman.  When she married 5 years ago, she started a business with her husband, who helps her sell fruit and fruit juice.  They both leave the house at 6:00 am on their tricycle, which serves as their means of transportation.  They travel around the city selling fruit in the busiest places in the city, like hospitals, high schools and markets.  Maria, her husband and their children travel around together the whole day, which is very tiresome due to the heat.

Asror is a humble farmer. He is married and has two children. His job as a farmer is the only source of income for his family. He works on a plot of land of 0.8 hectares and he is awaiting harvest season at the moment. The main problem he is facing in farming is lack of capital to enable him to buy high quality seeds and also to buy fertilizer. Therefore Asror is applying for a loan from IMON International. He will use the loan money to buy high quality seed, fertilizer, and pesticide. \r\n\r\nAsror hopes to be able to improve the quality of his harvest by having all of those. With this his revenue will increase and he will be able to finance his children's education to higher level and also to meet his family's daily needs.\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary.\r\n\r\nSamah has a grocery store and wants to purchase more groceries to have a better selection for sale, in order to increase her income. She doesn't have enough money to pay for this, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Samah gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase more groceries and have a variety of groceries for sale. This will enable her to compete, to sell more and to increase her income in order to have a better quality of life. Samah is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead in the grocery store.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Currently, she is a member of the \"Uni\u00f3n por el Progreso\" (\"Union for Progress\") communal bank, which is maD. up of 8 members who dedicate themselves to various business activities. Marisol has been a domestic worker for two years, doing cleaning, cooking, and washing. This job came about because her husband's salary as a taxi driver did not cover their basic costs, such as education, food, and services. Marisol tells us that her motivation to move ahead is her children - thanks to her effort and dedication, she has succeeded in bringing in more money, her children go to high school, and, above all, her family has a better quality of life.

Her eldest daughter is 26-years-old and self-employed.  Her 23-year-old daughter is in her fourth year of her studies and her youngest daughter who is 20-years old is in her third year of studies.  Her husband works as a construction worker.\r\n<p>\r\nHer intentions are to generate sufficient income in order to continue maintaining her business, which is now her primary source of income.  Her hopes are that her daughters will have a secure future in which they can overcome whatever situation they are presented with.  She also wishes to have good health in order to see the success of her daughters in their careers.  Additionally she wishes to leave them with housing where they can live with dignity.  \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Pastora Alarc\u00f3n runs a bookstore where she offers products such as: notebooks, pencils, erasers, pens and cards.  Her business is located in Telica and she has run the business for 10 years.  She began her business in order to have another source of income, which helped her and her daughters to have a better life and security.  When she began her business it was with her own small amount of capital that she invested in small things such as rulers, bags and markers but with only these things she could not satisfy the demand of her customers.

For the past 12 years, Gladis has been selling all kinds of different spices, which she distributes to local grocery stores for payments in cash or on credit. One of her daughters helps her with the business by distributing spices in other areas. Her favorite parts of her job are giving good customer service and traveling to new places to increase her sales. Her business is profitable because the spices she sells are in high demand from restaurants and housewives. Gladis would like to buy a car in the future to make the distribution of her products easier. This is her eighth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma; her favorite part about her village bank is that her fellow members make their loan payments punctually and understand one another. With the requested loan, Gladis will buy more spices so that she can continue to supply them to her clients and will also invest in her daughter's lumber sales business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":339147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy spices and invest in daughter's lumber sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-22T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":300.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":310.69},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":327.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":340.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":353.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":366.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.44,"local_amount":300.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":306.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211915},{"amount":104.86,"local_amount":310.69,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":317.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641443},{"amount":110.61,"local_amount":327.73,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":334.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080882},{"amount":115.03,"local_amount":340.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":347.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997023},{"amount":119.3,"local_amount":353.49,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":360.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842362},{"amount":123.76,"local_amount":366.69,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":374.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733933}],"funded_date":"2009-06-22T22:52:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":120845,"name":"Charibel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charibel M. is a responsible mother who aims to improve their standard of living.

She is married and she has 4 kids, with the youngest still living with her and her husband in a rented house. Twenty-six years ago she left her native land to run a stand in the municipality of Aledano Al Suyo. Since then, she has been living there and she has grown very fond of the people.  For this reason she set up her own business through which she sells various products, making her business unique from all the others.  In her mini-market, Magda sells school supplies, cosmetics, food and even ground spices. The great variety in the products she sells has won her a considerable clientele, making her very well known. She runs her business from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. every day, so that she might provide her clients with good service and a welcoming smile.

She is 34 years old, widowed, and mother to four children, ages 11, 8, 6, and 4.  The three eldest go to school.  Anabela only finished tenth grade; she quit when she lost her husband.  She lives in her own house with her children and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nWhen she got married, Anabela left Maputo for the city of Matola, where she established residence together with her late husband.  She has had her own business for more than 11 years.  She has no employees and sells mainly soft drinks.  Her monthly income is about 5,500 meticais, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some money with friends through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nAnabela has taken out loans before with the Tchuma Credit Association.  She decided not to continue with them for several reasons.  She learned about Hluvuku from a neighbor who is also a customer at this institution.  This is her third loan.  She is asking for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy products (eggs, oil, rice, peanuts and other products) to increase and diversify her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out more loans.  In the future, she would like to ask for more loans to continue construction on a rental house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

They have a child who is 11 years old and is currently going to school. \r\n\r\nAgnes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Agnes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as funds for the business operations, so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family and for her child\u2019s education. Agnes is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Rosalinda V., 46, learned this at a young age and aims to keep an eye on the future of her business and family. She has only finished high school, but looking forward, she has the rest of her life to spend with her husband, Florante, an aircraft maintenance personnel. Also, three bright futures are in their hands as they take care of three children. Together, they live in Silang, Cavite, Philippines.\r\n\r\nRosalinda owns a sari-sari (variety) store. She sells daily essentials such as shampoo, canned goods, and beverages. Aside from this store, she also has a small computer shop and a billiard shop, all located in their community. She has been in this micro business for three years now, and she earns around PHP11,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue running her business, she applied for a PHP30,000 loan. She will use this money to buy another computer to meet the demands of her clients. Also, she will purchase grocery items to add to her store shelves. Rosalinda is grateful for the help being extended to her business, as it is what keeps her family up and going every day.\r\n\r\nBeing a sari-sari store owner, it is difficult for her to follow up with customers who have long lists of debts. But Rosalinda continues to devise strategies to meet this difficulty. Rosalinda also aims to save enough for old age. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":768255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married and has 4 children, aged 22. 21,13 and 11. In 2002, she established her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 4 hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received, and successfully repaid, a loan from Patan BPW and used the funds to buy seeds and fertilizers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Dhankumari plans to uplift the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.

He is a distributor of sodas and beer which he sells in cases to retailers. Most villages have one distributor. He will purchase quantities of 200 cases at a time with 24 bottles to a case. A case of soda will cost him 9700 shillings, or about 400 shillings per bottle. He will then sell it to the retailer who will sell it to the customer for 500 shillings. So, the gross profit earned between both the wholesaler and the retailer is about 100 shillings per bottle. 100 shillings is about five cents. \r\n<p>\r\nVincent has been a distributor since 1993. This is an excellent business, because you have a contract with the bottler and you have little competition.

Like every mother, she longed to give her children a good education. Since it was her top priority, she went to work every morning. But over the course of time her eldest son became aware of the need and was eager to work. When he graduated he used his savings from his work to install some internet stations in their house, giving his mother the opportunity to run her own business. The business is 6 years old now and she manages it happily. But her entrepreneurial spirit inspired her to install telephone booths beside the computers, which has helped her neighbors with their communications and increased her earnings. In the future, Tarcila would like to continue expanding her services, and would like to install a pharmacy in the corner of the house, since her daughters studied pharmacy and it would be an additional service to provide her neighbors. She's been working with MFP for four years, and this is her eighth loan. She feels very happy to be part of her communal bank, since she receives support from the organization and from the other members, who work together for the good of the whole group. With the requested sum, she will buy some computers, and will also invest 100 soles each in the maintenance of the computers she already has.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

H\u1ed3ng has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 1400000 (~80$) VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, H\u1ed3ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u1ed3ng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2442600 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her seventh loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  H\u1ed3ng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n1.  N.

Beauty salons are widespread all over Kampala, and it's always the way beauticians handle clients that sells their services. If one's beauty salon has a reputation for servicing clients well, that will, without a shadow of a doubt, play in the favor of that business. That is what has been unfolding at Deborah's salon. She and her employees aim at offering the best of service to not only their usual clients but also new clients. This has endeared them to many people, most especially women.\r\n\r\nNot everything has been going well, however. She says the rising cost of doing business in most of East Africa has not spared her business. She says most of the cosmetics and other equipment she uses at her salon are increasingly becoming expensive. As a result, her business's growth has been stifled somewhat.\r\n\r\nShe remains upbeat, hoping for a favorable turn in circumstances soon.

After having correctly repaid their six preceding solidarity loans, they are now on their seventh, which will be used to buy:  forty bags of henna processed into powder, six boxes of band-aids (for the henna), one bag of urea (used for enriching the black color of the henna), ten boxes of bar soap, three dozen of liquid soap, three bags of millet, two bags of beans, 50 kg of <i>gueni<\/i> and <i>magnonkiss\u00e8ni<\/i> (seeds of wild exotic plants), and five bottles of <i>eau de cologne<\/i>.  The <i>gueni<\/i>, <i>magnonkiss\u00e8ni<\/i>, and the perfume are made into incense to be sold.  \r\n<p>\r\nSupplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou and sometimes in Tissala.  Sales are made to customers essentially composed of women, cash or credit accepted, in their homes, door-to-door in town, at the M\u00e9dine marketplace, and sometimes at the grand marketplace of S\u00e9gou. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 39,500 francs CFA that will be use to repay the loan, to participate in social events, and to cover certain family expenses.  Their ambition is to buy cows to obtain milk to drink and to sell, as well as to use their dung as organic manure to fertilize the fields.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":300403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mah\t                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan\t                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tin\u00e9                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":608.33,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":300790.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621212},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020173},{"amount":304.18,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242928},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678639},{"amount":304.15,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:36Z","rounded_local_amount":150395.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112544}],"funded_date":"2009-05-04T20:57:21Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104493,"name":"Burhoniddin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

Being in this business for 20 years, he knows very well how to choose the animals, how to breed them and look after them. Thus, he gets up every morning in order to feed the animals and to look after them.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with a wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures and traditions of native African people. She works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Ester currently earns about $100 a month from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Paquito is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be his fifth loan from GDMPC.

It is the second largest city in Pakistan and the capital of Punjab province. She is the mother of three children \u2013 two daughters and a son. Her older daughter is studying in 5th grade and her son is in 2nd grade, while her younger daughter is just 5 years old and has not started to attend school yet. \r\n\r\nGulshan is living in a small two-room house where she moved after her marriage to D. H.. Her husband has a shop in the market where he sells milk and yogurt. His business is doing well and he is earning a good income. Gulshan has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband\u2019s business.  This is her 3rd loan with Asasah, and she has proved to be a responsible lendee, never missing any meetings.

Sumaliring, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: fish vending and food vending businesses. Her husband Obaldo D., who is 46 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 12 to 22 years old.\r\n\r\nJohnita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Johnita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children's education and family. Johnita D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Until 2004, Oyungerel worked as a retail staffer for several local companies. \r\n\r\nSince 2005, Oyungerel has supported her family by operating a jewelry retail stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. She began her business by distributing silver rings, necklaces, earrings and bracelets to local customers. Now her working capital is about 1.5 million MNT and its turnover is twice a month. She purchases her products from a Turkish jewelry wholesale supplier. \r\n\r\nHer moderate revenue supports her standard of living, though she would like to buy her own indoor jewelry store because the outdoor stall is difficult to work at due to weather conditions.  She is requesting a 500,000 MNT loan to invest in working capital before the Mongolian Lunar New Year holiday.  She believes that this loan and future loans will help her achieve her goal.  \r\n\r\nOyungerel\u2019s biggest dream is to see her daughter to be successful in life and to help provide that opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":702558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

This is forty-three-year-old Salma M. from Mwanza. She is married with five children, between the ages of eight and eighteen. She is also responsible for supporting a young girl who is an orphan. \r\n\r\nSalma has been running a poultry business since 2004. In her business she sells chickens as well as eggs. She works at the business for four hours a day, seven days a week with the assistance of two employees. Salma currently earns about $500 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 to buy more chicks which she will raise and resell. In the future, she plans to open another business. Salma thanks you for supporting her!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their business equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, which enables them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more chicks to raise and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613669},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010748},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233034},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664825},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105537},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022665},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867914},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757115},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146227},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984389}],"funded_date":"2009-04-01T23:50:06Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":100413,"name":"Akeem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akeem A. is 33 years old and married with two children.

Her daughter attends a local secondary school and her husband helps Davaadulam with her business where she sews lightweight leather coats that are suitable for the spring and fall weather here in Mongolia. She started her business in 2000 by hand making all of her own coat designs. Today, because of her poor eyesight, the construction of the coats is done by a local seamstress, but Davaadulam does all of the designing and selling of her coats. Her working capital recently reached 2,000,000 tugrug (~1400 USD) and her target market is local middle-aged women. Her designs are selling quite well, however she would like to expand her product line to include winter coats which can be sold at a higher price and would broaden her customer base. She would also like to eventually move to a workspace that is closer to her home and more comfortable than her current workspace. Davaadulam is requesting a 1,700,000 (~1200 USD) loan to purchase materials which can be used to help her begin making winter

Everyday Elmer works as a day laborer on the farms of his neighbors, from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon. His job is to remove the weeds and thus clean the fields, allowing for a good development of the crops. Working in this manner is satisfying and profitable, as Elmer makes agreements to finish a certain amount of land in 15 days, and then finishes the agreed amount with his wife in only 9 or 10 days. He then spends the extra time working on his coffee crop, thus he is able to take care of his own harvest. Elmer likes farm labor, although sometimes the process of cultivating the coffee is long and difficult, but that is his way of earning more money.\r\n\r\nThis is Elmer's second loan with MFP, where he has agreed to make all the payments on time and to continue working as the secretary for his communal bank.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is also a fisherman and gets a low income from fishing.\r\n\r\nMuna wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her and for her children, living room furniture, etc., but she hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Muna gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to purchase the furniture her family needs. This will offer to Muna and her family better and healthier living conditions.\r\n\r\nMuna is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead at the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She lives with Cerefino, her husband of 25 years. They have 5 children. They take care of only 4 of them in their own house, which is located in the annex of Usibamba. Every morning as is her custom, she goes to take care of her crops as it is the season and she needs a good harvest. Her principal crops are alfalfa, grass, oats and other food for her animals, as she breeds cows. She already has 8 cows, 3 of which are pregnant and so do not give milk. Although now feeling the pinch, she knows that this will not last forever as when the calves are born her cows will give her good milk which she will sell at a good price. However, what she likes doing the best is weaving. While going about her daily chores, she makes various garments such as sweaters, rugs, quilts and other accessories made from wool. This gives her extra income and she also enjoys the work. She belongs to the communal bank \"Usibamba\" and this is their 3rd loan with MFP, from which she is hoping to receive a small loan to reach her goals. On the other hand, she promises to make her repayments, as the members of her bank are responsible and very supportive people. Amelia on receiving your support, will invest the money requested to purchase 2 milking cows with which she intends to increase her number of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":904358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 2 cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-26T13:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3057.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712950}],"funded_date":"2011-10-26T20:47:42Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":355343,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 29 years old and a father of two children.

Ricmar has been engaged in his business for more than10 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ricmar joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ricmar is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase fishing net. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ricmar from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his business and to support his family's basic needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Emma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Emma from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.
