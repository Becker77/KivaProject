She and her husband work together to raised their big family. They are currently living at Taghangin, Morong Rizal, Philippines. She is also a woman of good faith to conquer all challenges to achieve family dreams. \r\n\r\nNenita\u2019s main goal is to build a sustainable business to meet the needs of her seven children; she was thus encouraged to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2004. The previous loans she received from ASHI were carefully invested in her variety store. Since then, the business has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. Nenita needs a loan to help boost her business for increased profit making.\r\n\r\nShe runs a variety store. She started her variety store through her initiative of dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business. She is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 to use for additional capital to improve her business and her income. Specifically, the money will use to purchase five sacks of rice, charcoal, sugar, canned goods, cigarettes, fabric conditioner, and other inventory for her variety store. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to another village. Her seven children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store. She now feels very happy with the service of ASHI and KIVA. It gives them a big chance to pursue their family dreams. She hopes that they continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of the Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. With its outstanding achievements over the years, it has become one of the role models in credit delivery to the poor in the

He lives in his own house with his family and supports two brothers who live with him.\r\n\r\nJoaquim left Manhi\u00e7a to move to Boane District with his parents when he was very young.  For more than two years he has had his own shoe resale business.  He also builds brick houses.  He has one employee who helps him with his work, and he earns about 9,000 meticais per month, which he uses for household expenses and still manages to save some money through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Joaquim learned about Hluvuku through his mother, who is also a customer of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 9,000 meticias to buy pairs of shoes so he can increase his inventory.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he will be able to take out more loans.  In the future, he intends to ask for more loans to use in his business, and one of his dreams is to have a nice shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

He is a widower, and since then has shared his life with his 2 beloved children in their own home.\r\nHe cultivates bananas and coffee. With his vast lands he has become one of the main producers in the area. He brings his produce to the city of La Merced, where he already has customers waiting for him, since he always offers produce of very high quality. What he most likes about his job is harvesting the coffee, which he does with much effort. He has been doing this for 30 years and considers the most difficult part to be keeping his crops safe from the pests that can affect them. In the future, he wants to buy a car, with which he will be able to transport his products. This is his second loan with MFP, and he is prepared to pay his quotas punctually and he has already started to save up. In his community group he is a very happy member and is always very aware of the agreements he has with his peers.

After several years of apprenticeship along side her mother, Fatoumata was able to master trading on a small scale. Later, she developed her own wings and was able to carry out the same activity as her mother. She has been selling clothes, blankets, sheets and shoes for fifteen years and has a strong reputation in the neighborhood. With the goal of increasing her working capital, in order to make more profit, Fatoumata has turned to Soro Yiriwaso. This is her first individual loan, and she plans to use it to buy 5 blankets and 5 pieces of embroidered \"pagne\" (printed cotton fabric).\r\n\r\nFatoumata obtains her supplies from wholesalers in Bamako, then she sells for cash and on credit to customers who are, for the most part, women. With this loan, she plans to make a monthly profit of 60,000 CFA. This will enable her to help her husband and to participate in social events (baptisms, weddings, etc.).

She is 45 years old. Marifel is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Marifel owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.

Marifel is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marifel from HSPFI.

Nevertheless, Venus plans to resolve this issue and come up with a bigger, better store \u2013 not just to serve her community, but to help her family as well.

She earns her living by operating a business selling fish. Her husband Arnie, who is 39 years old, works as a plumber to earn his living.  They have three children who are 2 to 13 years old. Georgette joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Georgette has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000. She intends to use the loan to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for children's education and family needs. Georgette is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The funds will be used to pay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family, and to invest the rest in the businesses.  Their ambition is to diversify their commerce by embracing other income-generating work, such as opening a shop for ready-to-wear clothing. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":271199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothing and shoes for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":93033,"name":"La Union Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cLa Union\u201d is a group of ten entrepreneurs seeking their third loan from Esperanza International.

Sara is the president of this group in the city of Santiago.  \r\n\r\nSara, mother of a two year old daughter, has used her past two Esperanza loans to fund her \u201ccolmado\u201d, or small grocery store.  With her first loan, Sara ran her own small colmado until a member of her microfinance bank became ill and could no longer run her colmado.  Sara merged the two colmados and with her second loan was able to fund the joint effort.  The previously ill member of the bank is now healthy and will be taking over the joint colmado and Sara will use her third loan to start a new business selling used clothing.  Sara is able to buy used clothing in bulk packages and sell to her neighbors and neighboring communities.  When asked about the dreams for her business and life, Sara declares that she intends to help those who are ill as she has in the past and to continue to provide a good life for her child.  \r\n\r\nOther members of Sara\u2019s microfinance bank run similar entrepreneurial activities including a beauty salon, cake sales, and a small restaurant.  \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Esperanza and this

Desde entonces empez\u00f3 a dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a la elaboraci\u00f3n de esta prenda, ya que es m\u00e1s comercial. Durante el mes de marzo vienen de otras ciudades sus compradores, quienes se dedican a vender este tipo de tejidos a los turistas que visitan sus ciudades durante la semana santa. La idea de Valerio es producir de 5 a 6 docenas y luego viajar a esos lugares para vender a los turistas directamente, pero como sus pedidos se incrementan en esos meses le es imposible realizar el viaje, y cuando quiere tejer durante otros meses cercanos a esta fechas, no puede porque no cuenta con el capital suficiente.

When he married, he learned to make tapestries and blankets and 3 years ago his brother-in-law taught him to make beautiful blankets with diverse colors and with thickness. Since then he started to spend more time making clothing, which is more commercial. During the month of March, his buyers, who sell these types of textiles to tourists during Holy Week, have come from other cities. Valerio's idea is to make 5 or 6 dozen and then travel to sell to the tourists directly, but his orders have increased recently and it is impossible to make the trip. When he wants to make textiles during other months close to holiday dates, he can't because he doesn't have sufficient capital. However, Valerio has not given up this goal and continues to producing in order to increase his earnings and have the ability to make the trip in the coming years. For the time being, he and his wife will continue to make textiles and offer them to other clientes. This is his first loan with MFP (field partner), he just became a member of the community bank, and he is very happy for the welcome that the other members gave him. He ahs also made a commitment to pay his share on time. The money he is asking for is for providing necessary material, such as processed wool and dying powders of the desired colors for the wool. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":292706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying materiales for making blankets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123942}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T19:22:00Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Brooks","image":263842}},{"id":101225,"name":"Yorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yorn P., 50, is a widow with six children: three sons and three daughters.

He lives with his family, including his wife, 6 children that are school-aged, and his parents also. His wife helps him with caring for their land. In the past they have had problems in harvesting; having to sell their crop in advance and see reduced earnings. <P>\r\n\r\n By this time Mukim has gained a lot of experience in his business and now his crop is one of the most sought after at the market. He now faces a small problem because his field is infertile, which makes it difficult to grow his crops. To solve this problem, he has decided to request a loan to buy seeds and fertilizers to support the field and make his crops more productive.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells most of her chickens to her community and consumes the rest. \r\n\r\nIt was her mother who encouraged her to join this entrepreneurial group, and she has completed two successful loan cycles with them.  With the loan she is seeking, she is going to buy some more chickens and feed and she is going to pay for her husband's preventive healthcare.  Her greatest dream is to own her own house.  \r\n\r\nBlanca Dut\u00e1n is also part of this communal bank due to an acquaintance in the community who invited her to join this lovely group.  She has been part of the group for 8 cycles, and with her past loans  she paid off a few of her husband's loans, which he acquired for his carpentering business.  She helps him with this business along with her duties as housewife and care for their 11- and 5-year-old children.  \r\n\r\nBlanca, at 27 years old, already owns her own home thanks to the couple's joint efforts.  The carpentering business is based out of their home, and with this new loan, they will start another business caring for animals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to increase the inventory of her store. In the future, Rita plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores called  'pasal' are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical 'pasal' might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\n This loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\n For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

Malatapay, Zamboangita, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  carinderia (eatery), and gasoline sales. Her husband Ramil, who is 40 years old, works as a Boat Captain to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between 8 and 15 years old.\r\n\r\nRose joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rose has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the food stall and gasoline sales, so that she can continue to save up for future improvement of business and for the education of her children. Rose B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International <\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

B., John K., Pa Mohamed K. and Safie K.. They call their group Second Hand Clothing, named after their businesses. They are business people in Makeni, selling second-hand clothes. This is not the first loan these entrepreneurs are receiving from SMT\/Kiva. Previous loans have made a lot of meaningful impacts on the lives and businesses of these people. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are again asking for a new loan of Le 1,200,000 for each to further strengthen their businesses.\r\n\r\nJoseph (left) is the leader of the group. He is age 39 and married with three children. Joseph was born in a village called Loka Masana, in northern Sierra Leone.

Mary Jane is a fish vendor, a suitable trade as she lives near the sea and has easy access to the local fisher folk's catch. Working in partnership with her husband, Cenon, she is determined to raise her six children well and provide all of them with a good future.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1998 she joined NWTF\u2014Project Dungganon to have access to additional capital for her fish-vending business. She later used her loans and savings to build her own fishing boat, and the resulting profits from this move come to approximately PHP 10,000 per month, just enough to support the needs of her family. She now plans to use the PHP 19,000 loan from NWTF\u2014Project Dungganon, her thirteenth consecutive loan from this MFI, as revolving working capital for her fish-vending business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through its alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a dollar a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live lives that they can finally call honorable ones. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":381170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

This is her first loan with the institution, but she has worked with other credit institutions who offered her loans to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay the loan back without any problems so she can receive other loans which she will use to furnish her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":401367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase construction material (cement, sand, doors, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-10-22T17:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neli Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.47},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.03,"local_amount":454.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:31:10Z","rounded_local_amount":480.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971867},{"amount":42.56,"local_amount":1134.85,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816805},{"amount":60.31,"local_amount":1608.26,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1700.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708988},{"amount":62.42,"local_amount":1664.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1759.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938052},{"amount":66.31,"local_amount":1768.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1869.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938053},{"amount":123.01,"local_amount":3370,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3562.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.36,"payment_id":151916013}],"funded_date":"2009-10-22T20:23:57Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":146413,"name":"Rufina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Rufina P.'s dream is to give all of her children a proper education.

She is 54 years old. Teresita is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTeresita is married and has 9 school-aged children. To make a living, Teresita owns & operates a business venture in the food sector selling a variety of vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from vegetable vending. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

El problema m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que enfrenta es que no tiene una vivienda propia, y los directivos de la escuela le dieron permiso para que construyera una habitaci\u00f3n dentro de las instalaciones de la misma y gracias a los pr\u00e9stamos obtenidos en FAMA pudo hacerlo aunque es muy peque\u00f1a para su familia. Su reto es ahorrar aunque sea de poco en poco para comprar un solar y poder construir su casa, seguir manteniendo a su familia porque hace dos a\u00f1os su esposo muri\u00f3 y no tiene ning\u00fan otro soporte econ\u00f3mico. Elbia solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar papas, chiles, cebollas, zanahorias, pataste, repollo, etc. y as\u00ed ofrecer una mayor variedad de productos a sus clientes. Una de sus ventajas es que su hijo mayor le ayuda a transportar en una carreta las verduras desde su casa al mayoreo y no tiene que pagar transporte ni empleado porque \u00e9l tambi\u00e9n le ayuda a atender a los clientes. Con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo espera obtener mejores ganancias para ahorrar un poco, seguir llevando el alimento a su casa y seguir pagando el estudio de sus cuatro hijos menores.

From Monday to Friday she has a steady job working as a Cleaning Lady and on weekends she sells vegetables.\n\nThe greatest obstacle she faces is not owning her own home and the school administrators gave her permission to build a room on the school grounds.  Thanks to FEMA loans she was able to do so although it is too small for her family.\n\nHer challenge now is to save up, even if just bit by bit, to buy a piece of property on which to build her house and to continue supporting her family because her husband died two years ago and she has no other source of income.\n\nElbia is requesting funds to buy potatoes, chilies, onions, carrots, chayote, cabbage, etc. in order to have a wider variety available for her customers.\nAn advantage she has is that her oldest son helps her move the vegetables from home to the wholesale market with a cart so she doesn\u2019t have to pay transport costs nor hire an employee since he helps her tend to customers too.\n\nWith support from the loan she hopes to earn better profits so that she can start to have some savings, continue to bring food home and pay for her four youngest children\u2019s education.  Her dream is to also have a stand to sell clothing to have a second source of income and start to build her house and have her children graduate.\n\nElbia is very grateful because financing from FEMA has helped her improve her economic conditions and she would like to thank everyone ahead of time who will invest in her through the loan.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":611717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-10-12T18:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Blacina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elbia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.98,"local_amount":963,"processed_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":963.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396170},{"amount":28.43,"local_amount":537,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":537.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396171},{"amount":564.71,"local_amount":10666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-09T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10670.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534731},{"amount":125.49,"local_amount":2370.32,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2371.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137403},{"amount":130.39,"local_amount":2463.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2463.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414839}],"funded_date":"2010-10-13T02:49:27Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":241414,"name":"Ibrahim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, is pleased to present to you teachers of the Kankalay Islamic Primary School.

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: pig fattening, Manicure\/Pedicure services and food vending. Nemesia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemesia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future to provide her with more income and to support the needs of her family. Nemesia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

His main source of income comes primarily from buying and selling coconuts in the local community, and he also buys and sells soft drinks. Rolando has been engaged in his business for over seven years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nRolando joined HSPFI in 2010 to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rolando has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI that was used to purchase additional inventory and use as working capital. For his second loan, he is requesting 4,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell such as coconuts. Roland plans to use the additional revenue generated from his business to improve and expand. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Three of them are enrolled in a local school and getting their education. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to further improve her business of sewing. She will use the loan money in buying a new sewing machine because her previous machine has become old and is not producing a quality work. The new machine will help her finish orders on time so she receives more orders every month. She has been operating this business for over 8 years and is very hopeful that it will expand further after the loan investment. \r\n   \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 3rd loan application.

What she most likes about her work is being able to work for herself.\r\n\r\nNaise also owns a grocery store where she sells essentials such as sugar, milk, eggs and other food products.  She tells us that she sells an average of 60 Peruvian soles' worth of goods every day.  The main difficulty she faces in her business is that of working capital since, in order to make immediate profits, she has to stock her store with a range of products.  Most of her money is tied up in her farming.\r\n\r\nNaise's dream is to create a big, well-stocked store for the residents of her village.  She belongs to the \"Siempre Juntos\" (Always Together) community bank and this is her first loan with MFP.  She is grateful for the opportunity that they have given her to carry out her plans.  Naise is getting prepared for the harvesting of her corn crop at the beginning of March.  She will use her loan to buy several sacks of manure which she hopes will allow her to obtain good profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":732622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of organic manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naise ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1038,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245047}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T16:03:58Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":286489,"name":"God Bless Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo are members of the \u201cGod Bless\u201d group.

Everything turned out as planned because she was able to pay her daily expenses and provide for her children. She began her business about eight years ago and little by little she has been able to succeed. She started out just selling just food items and other household items. Then, she decided that since she had enough space, she would open up an internet cafe in her store. Erika was able to invest her money in the internet caf\u00e9 and then earn more money since she always has paying customers using the computers.\r\n<p>\r\nShe needs a loan of $975 dollars.  She will pay it back in 6 months. That way it will help her upgrade her computers with better programs and to stock her little store with more items.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 35 years old, is married, and is taking care of 2 children. He is a fighter and likes his work, even though, at times, it is very exhausting. He offers a tricitaxi (a bicycle-operated taxi) service. He has been pursuing this activity for more than 6 years. Before this, he raised livestock, but with the money from that, he succeeded in buying a bicycle. At first, he didn\u2019t have the experience needed for this, but over time, he got it. This loan that he is requested will be used to make improvements to his bicycle and to provide a better service to his clients. His dream is to succeed and for his children become professionals, since Adrian didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":360886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Capital for his business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-29T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adrian De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":340.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600082},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":340.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035973},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":340.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948367},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":340.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790312},{"amount":17.21,"local_amount":344.17,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":351.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680947},{"amount":16.12,"local_amount":322.51,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":329.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075486}],"funded_date":"2009-07-29T18:29:26Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":129959,"name":"Adijat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adijat is a hair specialist and she also sells hair-cream and hair-extensions.

She is an ambitious and hard working person. She lives with her parents and with her sister Lisbet who is 22 years old. They live in their own home located in Palcamayo. Since she was 15 years old she has been baking breads for sale in her neighborhood and today she has her own bakery from where she sells pies and cakes. Her responsibilities soon grew when her sister, Lisbet, wanted to study to be a nurse at the university. So Jocelinda decided to study agriculture to help her parents in the harvests of sweet peas, potatoes, and vegetables. On the weekends she goes to supervise the fields and she barters for the best prices in the central markets in her city and in the capital. Jocelinda's favorite thing to do is to help her family. She would like to purchase in wholesale a stock of merchandise for her bakery with the goal of one day having her own fields. She will be able to have larger harvests of vegetables and be able to meet the demand.

This is a mixed group of 21 individuals living near each other. They are represented by Mrs. Sokhna D., who is the Vice-President. Mrs. D. has been working for over 30 years selling fabrics, shoes, palm oil and miscellaneous items. She also prepares food for sale. She has chosen this work because she was attracted to it but also in the desire to earn an income allowing her to provide for her personal needs. She is seeking a loan of 2,250,000 West African Francs for her group. This loan is destined for purchasing various goods to increase the members\u2019 stock. The main objective of the group members is to increase their income and to improve the socioeconomic conditions of their respective families. \n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.   They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n\nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week.  Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":736487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Bolstering

Prior to the marriage, she was studying to be a jewelry maker and is now involved in a fine jewelry business.  She makes women's national jewelry from gold with unusual designs.  Nasiba sells her goods at a market and primarily makes the jewelry to-order.  She has a large catalog of samples for every taste.  She does not yet have apprentices because she has a small child and would not have time for apprentices.  In the future, Nasiba plans to open her own shop and teach her trade to young women.  She has been partnering with us since 2010 and previously obtained a loan to purchase scrap to make her jewelry.  This is now her second time obtaining financing from us, and this is another loan to be used for household buildings.  Because Nasiba's husband is currently working outside the city limits, and their house construction has began, Nasiba needs our

Today thanks to the support that Ceprodel offered her for half the loans, she has been able to amplify her business in the purchase of materials such as plates utensils and place settings.

Su necesidad actualmente es invertir en infraestructura ya que su local es peque\u00f1o y adem\u00e1s no presenta buenas condiciones para los clientes.\r\n<\/div>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":115536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The sale of food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2008-01-15T21:45:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-29T23:02:28Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2008-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82,"local_amount":1513.85,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145758},{"amount":82,"local_amount":1513.85,"processed_date":"2008-03-30T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169548},{"amount":82,"local_amount":1513.85,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196865},{"amount":79,"local_amount":1458.46,"processed_date":"2008-05-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223625}],"funded_date":"2008-01-15T23:02:28Z","paid_date":"2008-05-30T09:09:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35730,"name":"Veselin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veselin V. is registered as a private agricultural producer in the village of Rogozen near Vratza.

Her greatest dream is for her children to successfully complete their studies. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laurie Paguio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":360911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-08-03T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600088},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":918.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035980},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948374},{"amount":1.25,"local_amount":24.95,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790321},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":906.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":924.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790322},{"amount":45.27,"local_amount":905.31,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":923.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680954},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":863.59,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":881.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075492},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":918.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911524},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947370},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":918.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675652},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710047}],"funded_date":"2009-08-13T05:48:09Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Paguio","image":346696}},{"id":129975,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is the 45-year-old mother of five children who are currently in school.

Previously she tried selling her handmade clothing to wholesale vendors, but they refused to pay her a good price.

Hilda has been selling her products from that location for the past two years.  Her business has proven to be very profitable, since she is able to cover her shop rent and her household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Hilda has farmland in which she grows oats (as seen in the photograph).  She stores whatever she harvests so that she can sell in times of drought.  Hilda successfully divides her time between both businesses in order to provide for her family\u2019s welfare.\r\n<p>  \r\nThis is Hilda\u2019s ninth loan with MFP.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarlina is married and has a school-aged child. To make a living, Marlina makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from selling frozen products, fish and tamarind fruits. Marlina has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marlina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Marlina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.
