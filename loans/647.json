She is a very pleasant, kind, and hardworking young woman.  She is single and does not have any children.  She lives with her parents and her four siblings, whom she helps with their studies and with some of the difficulties they have which are typical of their age.  \r\n\r\nGraciela makes a living selling meals.  She begins her work very early, going first to the market in search of the best ingredients and the choicest vegetables, then going home to prepare various meals that she can offer her customers.  She then goes off to the city\u2019s sawmills, where she has a contract with some of the workers to bring them meals daily.  Graciela has only been in business for three months; she previously had a bodega, but she had to change her economic activity because it was not bringing in much profit.  She now works happily with her aunt and her mother, who help her with everything.\r\n\r\nAt first Graciela had numerous doubts and difficulties, but thanks to help from her family she was able to overcome these problems.  She is now very happy, since her work is easier with all of their help.  She currently serves an average of 30 pre-ordered meals per day, and prepares about 20 more meals as backup.  Graciela would like to set up a restaurant eventually, which would allow her to continue working with her family and to improve their lives together.

The art of embroidery has always attracted her ever since she was a child. She got the opportunity to work in embroidery four years ago when she met her best friend who taught her how to do it. Her friend encouraged her to embroider clothes for export as they always have a large number of orders to complete. Since then, she has been working every day from her home where she feels comfortable close to her beloved family. The difficult part of her work is to complete the large number of clothing orders since it is very tiring for her hand to maintain the constant rhythm. Gladys hopes in the future to have her own embroidery workshop where machines can help her produce a larger quantity of clothing. Four years ago she started working with Kiva partner MFP and is very happy to be part of such a nice group and to be working alongside her friends. The money she is asking for will be used to buy a larger quantity of supplies such as thread and material for her embroidery.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":280014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy embroidery supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-04T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":417},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":415}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117207},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012118},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595703},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989966},{"amount":129.27,"local_amount":417,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":422.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211097},{"amount":128.65,"local_amount":415,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":420.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640599}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T22:50:14Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":96509,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom S. is 24 years old and resides in the Kampong Cham province with her husband and two of her children.

When a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000, she was very apprehensive because she did not want to be in debt, but she was determined to help her family, so with the agreement of her husband, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and with her first loan she started a small general store and to make sure that she could pay back her loan she went around her community selling specialty goods house to house. The business nets around PHP1,600.00 ($33) per month, but is able to feed her family.\r\n\r\nShe has used subsequent loans to slowly but steadily build her business. Now on her 11th loan cycle, the PHP 15,000 she is borrowing will allow her to widen the variety of goods that she could sell in her store.

Shahnoza is 22-years old, married and the loving mother of three children. She works purchasing and reselling cows with her husband. She would like to request a loan of $800 USD in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demands. Shahnoza believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business in order to purchase additional cows and increase their income further.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her family in her own house.  What she wishes for the most is to give them a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s stall for selling shoes is located in the Laguna Temporal plaza (place where there are fairs in the city of Juliaca).  But, she does not just sell shoes.  She also makes them.  She is very good at her work, which is why she also distributes her footwear to other sellers.  What she likes the most about her work is making shoes, which she does with much effort.  She has been doing this for 11 years.  The most difficult part is transporting the shoes to the sales locations because she has to go to many locations.\r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to have a very large store where she can sell the shoes she makes.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She has paid her previous loans punctually.  She expects to pay this last one on time as well.  She is very active in her community bank.  She will use the 2,000 PEN that she is asking for to buy new materials to make a larger quantity of shoes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":379585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials for making shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T19:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":344.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081289},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":344.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997440},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":344.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842785},{"amount":350.35,"local_amount":1001,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734362}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T20:58:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":137520,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy is 36 years old and married with two children.

and female members dedicated to their respective small businesses. The members sell items such as used clothing, cosmetics, lingerie, perfumes, toys, and hair accessories.\r\n\r\nThe members of \u201cEl Progreso\u201d are from Linares, a city in the Maule region of central Chile. Linares is a city of vibrant commercial activity and has developed as an important center of exports, particularly because of their wine production. Nevertheless, the region is one of the poorest in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in merchandise by the \u201cEl Progreso\u201d group, in order to increase their supplies and earnings.\r\n\r\nMarcela, a representative of the group, is pictured in the front row in a black athletic suit with a fuchsia colored T-shirt. She sells underwear and socks for men, and like the other members of the group, she sells them from a stall on one of the main streets in the city of Linares. These stalls are free to use, as they have been constructed by the government for the use of small business owners.\r\n\r\nMarcela\u2019s dream is to achieve economic stability for her family and to continue funding her children\u2019s education, while also caring for her two-year-old nephew.\r\n\r\nFor Marcela, Fondo Esperanza has been the motivating force behind her business\u2019s growth because, before the loans, Marcela never had the funding to grow her business. Also, Marcela believes she has benefitted greatly from the training courses that are taught at their weekly communal bank meetings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":463624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Linares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-01-05T01:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tamara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eradie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arlette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaspar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1056702,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":73705},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":74192},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":74677},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75169},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":56467},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76032},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":76530},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77034},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77539},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":78045},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78552},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":79070},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":79590},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.4},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1049.66,"local_amount":528182,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:25:43Z","rounded_local_amount":532652.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072565},{"amount":419.74,"local_amount":211208,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:54:25Z","rounded_local_amount":212995.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944196},{"amount":630.6,"local_amount":317312,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":319997.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136672653}],"funded_date":"2010-01-06T00:31:46Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":170545,"name":"Jairo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jairo habita en el municipio del Coral,  tiene un a\u00f1o de laborar como responsable de Planificaci\u00f2n  de la Alcaldia del Coral Chontales, este joven esta felizmente casado tiene dos hijos menores de edad, su esposa  cuida de sus hijos y de los quehaceres del Hogar, esta solicitando su primer cr\u00e9dito a la instituci\u00f3n de AFODENIC para ser invertido en mejora de su vivienda, poniendo el piso de su casa y reparando una parte que se encuentra da\u00f1ada.

They have a child who is five years old. Luna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted to improve her family's life. With the help of six previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luna has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She has applied for a seventh loan, for PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to stock her clothing store. Her long-term goals are to expand her business and repair her house. Luna E. is a Dungganon (or honorable) woman who is following an honest path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

She earns her living by operating a tricycle transport business and a repair\/welding shop.  Her husband Romeo, who is 58 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 22 and 40 years old.  Nancy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nancy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy tools and materials in order to reinforce her business operations and further develop it.  Nancy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has a 3-year-old daughter and a 10-month-old son.  In search of a source of income for her family, Kanymbu decided to launch her own food sale and catering business.  The shop in which Kanymbu works also serves as a dining room.  One can have a bite to eat and buy the necessary food products.  Kanymbu has worked very hard to develop her business and has been very successful:  her business now brings in close to 10,000 som (KGS) per month.  Today, Kanymbu doesn't have a wide range of food items.  This is why she has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners and requested a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).  This loan will allow her to buy a broader range of merchandise, attract a larger number of customers and increase her sales.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":979685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a broader variety of food products.

She is 30 years old. Mary Fe is single and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Fe owns and operates a sari-sari, or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling frequently-used retail products in the local community. Mary Fe has been engaged in her business for more than 6 years and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2008, Mary Fe joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Mary Fe is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Mary Fe from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 23 years old. Remelyn is married and has an infant child. To make a living, Remelyn owns & operates a store where she sells daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Remelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Remelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Remelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Remelyn is requesting a new loan of 55,000 PHP, which will be used to fully pay for a transport vehicle to improve her business. She will also use the loan as additional capital for her mini grocery store. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Remelyn from PMPC and the second loan funded by Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The idea of having this kind of business crossed her mind when her husband who is also fisherman caught more fish in the lake, located in Talim Island, in the province of Rizal. Liwanag sold those in their neighborhood and she realized that selling fish earns profits bigger and faster than any other kind of business she had had in the past years of her life using her loan from ASHI. Unlike other products sold, fish is salable because it is one of the most basic needs of the human being, especially for people who live in very remote areas of the province. They are far from the municipal market thus the possibility of buying from vendors who come to their community is very high. Also, most people choose to buy fish rather than any other meat because it is cheaper and healthier.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Liwanag used her loans from ASHI in her fishing business. From the profits she earned, she was able to invest in her home and support her family financially, specially the tuition fees of her five children which are very expensive. \r\n\r\nShe kept on borrowing from ASHI to keep her business growing. Now, she plans to use her newly received loan in buying additional materials needed for her fishing business such as fishing nets and other supplies so that her husband will catch more fish to sell. If ever the couple gets better output, they will be able to invest more in their home.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dreams are for her four younger children to attain a degree, just like her eldest child, Raynan, who graduated from computer courses and has a successful job with the coastguard. Education is wealth that other people can\u2019t steal. The couple believes that education is the only inheritance they can offer their children. To make this happen, they help each other in order for them to achieve their dreams of giving their children the best in life.

I launched my business 15 years ago, with a capital of Q.500.00. As time went by I started to get new clients and I am now selling in different towns and villages where I offer my products on the streets. About 6 years ago, my sister introduced the idea of also selling beauty products through catalogs. Since I already had a good number of clients, the products we well received.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to the Lord people have been ordering clothing and beauty products, therefore I am in need of more capital to be able to fulfill their orders. Now that everything has gone up in price one needs to invest more in the merchandise, especially if one wants to have the items clients request readily available. My goal with this loan is to be able to take advantage of the season, in which people request large orders, due to the town celebrations that are soon to come. <p>\r\n\r\nI always work hard to get ahead and take good care of my two children, especially now that I don't live with my husband. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Libertad Leal, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy AnaDela B.

She is 39 years old. Florentina is the group leader for an eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Florentina C.'s Group.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFlorentina is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Florentina owns and operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Florentina has been engaged in her business for over 27 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Florentina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florentina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Florentina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young plants to raise. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Florentina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is married and has four children who are all adults living independent lives. He has seven additional dependents, who live with him because they are his relatives and he is the eldest in his family.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gibril established a cinema, sports, and games business. He began his business after he retired from his job. He started this business because he needed to find a new way of earning a living.  Working 3 days a week and 4 hours a day, he earns about 1,248,000 Sierra Leonean leones (SLL) every month from this business. He would like a loan 3,000,000 SLL.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to buy feed and vaccines for her pigs so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAilliene N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives with her common-law partner Rafael Quispe who is 33 years old. They have 3 children and they have their own house located in the community of Lobo Tahuantisuyo, in the district of Quimbiri. Lisbeth and her partner are the support for their children. Lisbeth was taught by her parents at a very young age how to work the land.\n\nLisbeth is a farmer and she has 7 hectares of land to cultivate coffee plants and bananas. They are native plants in the jungle region of Valle Rio Apurimac. She has been working the land for the past 6 years and she has her own fields but during the harvest she hires two farm hands to harvest and transport the products to the distributors. What she most enjoys about her work is the harvest. She always feels that the months of heavy work bring have their reward with the quality of the harvest. The most difficult part of the work has to transport the products form her community all the way to the distribution centers located in Quimbiri and San Francisco. This is where she gets better prices for her products. Her difficulties lie in not being able to count on financial resources to cover the advance payment required by the laborers who help her with her harvest. This is the reason why she requests a loan from MFP (Kiva Field Partner). But her trop priority now is to plant more coffee on a hectare of land that is not cultivated. This is the first loan that Lisbeth has with MFP and she knows that if she pays it on time she will be able to access future loan with greater ease. With the 1500 nuevos soles she requests she will hire laborers to help her harvest coffee grains.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":731190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day workers to help with the coffee harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-16T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lisbeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":141.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.26},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":159.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":171.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":178.53},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":184.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":190.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.02,"local_amount":141.86,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":143.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196376},{"amount":55.72,"local_amount":151.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":154.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270057},{"amount":55.29,"local_amount":150.78,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":153.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550074},{"amount":60.37,"local_amount":164.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":167.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718750},{"amount":63.1,"local_amount":172.09,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":174.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350204},{"amount":263.5,"local_amount":718.65,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":729.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850692}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T01:53:21Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":285868,"name":"Jivon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Jivon S. and his wife, Mrs. Souvpon Keov, live along National Road No. 1 approximately 20 kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

She began her business due to the need for an income additional to her husband\u2019s to cover the household expenses. They have a child who grows each day, as do their economical needs. She began some time ago selling different products and even had a homemade-food shop, which she had to close because of the increase in the shop\u2019s rent. So, one of her friends convinced her to sell clothes and offered to take her to places where she could buy clothes at good prices. She followed her friend\u2019s advice and began to sell clothes 12 years ago. Her sales went very well. She now has a fair number of clients. Muhabbat asks for 1500 Somoni ($450), which she will pay back in 10 months, to purchase seasonal garments. She wants to take advantage of the dates and have a more diverse variety of garments for her clients, which will allow her to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nMore information about Tajikistan and IMON International: \r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History: \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":241143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing children's clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T23:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muhabbat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":130.85},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":134.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":138.82},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":142.98},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":147.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":151.69},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":156.24},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":160.93},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.76},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":170.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":39.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.69,"local_amount":265.63,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":271.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10221133},{"amount":41.65,"local_amount":138.82,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":141.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20410056},{"amount":42.89,"local_amount":142.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":145.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27103078},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":147.27,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":150.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35997282},{"amount":45.51,"local_amount":151.69,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":154.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44580056},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":156.24,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":159.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52973539},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":160.93,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T15:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":164.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63193362},{"amount":49.73,"local_amount":165.76,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T17:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":169.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73621217},{"amount":51.21,"local_amount":170.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T20:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":174.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87058984}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T18:33:16Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T20:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Grace Rubenstein","image":47559}},{"id":84269,"name":"Nurush","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nurush G. is a very optimistic man in spite of the circumstances he has endured.

The women average 35 years of age and 5 children each.  They live together in the Rails Ko district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali), where they know one another through ties of community and friendship.  They were knowledgeable of Soro Yiriwaso (a micro-finance institution) following a general assembly held at the town hall of the rural community of Markala that was intended for artisans and small-scale entrepreneurs of the aforementioned town.  The women excel in the food sector (restaurants, selling grocery items, etc.)  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned with satisfying their customers, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program and are now on their fourth solidarity loan (group loan) after having correctly repaid the first three.  This loan will be used to buy:  two sacks of fresh onions, one basin of fresh tomatoes, two basins of dried okra (a portion in powdered form), two sacks of <i>fonio<\/i> (a kind of millet), one sack of peanuts for making into <i>djouga<\/i> (couscous made of <i>fonio<\/i> and peanuts), two boxes of potatoes to be sold fried or stewed, two sacks of sugar, one sack of ginger, one sack of dried hibiscus flowers, 25 kg of powdered milk, and one box of flavorings for making beverages (ginger and <i>dableni<\/i>:  a drink of hibiscus flower and yoghurt).  \r\n<p>\r\nSupplies of potatoes, <i>fonio<\/i>, and peanuts are gotten in Sikasso.  As for the goods for making local beverages and the condiments, these are gotten at the Diamarabougou fair.  Sales are made to customers composed of men, women, and children, cash or credit accepted, at the house, door-to-door, in eateries, and at the marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 43,750 francs CFA for making loan payments and for buying school supplies for the children.  Their objective is to have a house for living in.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1325,"image":{"id":291103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments and essential ingredient for making a local dish (djouga) and local beverages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1325,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farima             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ass\u00e9tou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciss\u00e9                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":625000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":165.62,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033751},{"amount":165.63,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621118},{"amount":165.63,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020084},{"amount":165.6,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:01Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242833},{"amount":165.62,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678459},{"amount":165.62,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112473},{"amount":165.62,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028115},{"amount":165.66,"local_amount":78125,"processed_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79578.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873493}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T12:20:04Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":100653,"name":"Saroeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saroeun L., 53, and her husband, Heng Min, 55, live on Island of Mekong River, about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.

and also continue to help her children establish their own lives.\r\n\r\nNena G. has been a widow since 2006 and lives in the village of Barangay Palaka, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. Her husband's death was a great loss to the family and since all of her seven children are grown up with their own families, Nena wanted to remain independent and be able to earn a living so that she could provide for her old age.\r\n\r\nYears ago Nena put up her general store to help her husband to raise income of the family to support its needs, especially as they had seven children. She said when she started her business, she found it quite hard to look after the needs of her children and at the same time handle the business, but she coped with all the hardships with much determination.\r\n\r\nBecause of Nena\u2019s hard work, her business grew, and she joined NWTF Project Dungganon (NWTF-PD) in 1998 so that she could access more capital for her business. With new capital infusion, she expanded her product offerings to include guinamos (shrimp paste) which is a popular flavoring and dish in the Philippines. She also traveled to other towns to sell her shrimp paste. Her guinamos was so popular that she now has regular customers, some from other towns, who prefer to buy their shrimp paste exclusively from her.\r\n\r\nNow, Nena earns a monthly income of PHP 18,000 and she saves most of this for her future security and for emergencies. She sometimes uses some of it to help out her children.\r\n\r\nNena\u2019s previous loan of Php 15,000 was used in her business as additional capital and it was repaid within her loan term in full and on-time, maintaining her good standing as an NWTF-PD member. Now she is borrowing Php 20,000 for her 15th loan to be utilized for her general store and her guinamos business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":438449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Jocotitlan, esta formado por 10 mujures exitosas, son muy trabajadores y unidas se apoyan mucho, tambien se conocen desde hace muchos a\u00f1os por eso fue que se animaron hacer un grupo al que llamaron \"Ollin\", desidieron ponerse asi porque tiene un significado que esta en Nahualt, la palabra significa movimiento, y para ellas es un movimiento el que hacen un cambio para tener una mejora en este caso una mejora economica atraves del prestamo, la comunidad donde vive el grupo esta lleno de alfareros, agricultores y profesionistas, hay poco comercio dentro de esta comunidad, los nombres de las 10 mujeres que integran el grupo son los siguientes:\n1.-Maura H. T.\n2.-Antonia L. A.\n3.-Maria Guadalupe H. H.\n4.-Yazmin T. H.\n5.-Alma Aurea A. G.\n6.-Reyna H. G.\n7.-Ma Francisca H. S.\n8.-Maria de Lourdes G. G.\n9.-Angela G. G.\n10.-Marisol H. G.\nEstos son los nombres de las mujeres que integran el grupo, cabe mencionar que hay mujeres de este grupo como do\u00f1a Angela, Alma y Reyna que pertenecen a un grupo de danzantes aztecas, las se\u00f1oras junto con otras personas son danzantes y tocan los tambores y hacen varios tipos de rituales en sus danzas. la Se\u00f1ora Angela es la encargada del grupo vive ahi en San Juan Coajomulco, tiene 47 a\u00f1os y 26 a\u00f1os de casada, ella es artesana y tambien es danzante azteca, tiene 3 hijos pero solo dos hijos dependen de ella, una hija la mayor ya es casada y los otros dos hijos estan estudiando la universidad en lenguas indigenas, vive en casa propia donde tambien es el lugar donde fabrica las artesanias, por ejemplo fabrica pulceras echas de maderas anillos, collares y aretes, el material que usa para fabricar son semillas, hilos, cuancas, madera etc. La se\u00f1ora Angela sale a vender por ejemplo en las ferias i de ves en cuando acomoda un puesto para vender, pero regularmente lo hace cuando sale a danzar en el centro y con la gente que se junta le ofrece lo que hace, lo dificil en su actividad es que a la gente le guste que le agrade el producto para que lo compre, el prestamo le va ayudar a do\u00f1a Angela porque nos comenta que le da una fuente de ingresos para tener mas ganancias, la meta que tiene es llegas a tener un local y vender lo que hago como tambien ahi mismo en el local fabricar los aretes y demas. Con las ganancias quiere poder seguir dando el estudio a sus hijos para que no se salgan de la escuela y la terminen.\nDo\u00f1a Angela tambien es empleada domestica de esta forma es como ayuda a su esposo y asus hijos para salir adelante y los motiva para seguir echandole ganas.","en":"The following group is called \u201cOllin.\u201d  It was formed in San Juan Coajomulco, Jocotitlan.  It\u2019s made up of ten successful, very hard working, unified, mutually supportive women.  They have also known each other for several years and that\u2019s why they were motivated to form a group that they called \u201cOllin.\u201d They decided to call it that because in Nahuatl that word means \u201cmovement\u201d and for them this is a movement toward improvement each one makes, in this case an economic improvement through the loan.  The community where this group lives is full of potters, farmers and professionals.  There is very little commerce within this community.  The names of the ten women who make up the group are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.-Maura Hern\u00e1ndez T.\r\n2.-Antonia L\u00f3pez \u00c1lvarez\r\n3.-Maria Guadalupe Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez\r\n4.-Yazmin T. Hern\u00e1ndez\r\n5.-Alma Aurea \u00c1lvarez Garc\u00eda\r\n6.-Reyna Hern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez\r\n7.-Ma Francisca Hern\u00e1ndez S.\r\n8.-Maria de Lourdes Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda\r\n9.-Angela Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda\r\n10.-Marisol Hern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez\r\n\r\nThese are the names of the women who make up the group.  It\u2019s worth mentioning that there are women in the group, like Angela, Alma and Reyna, who belong to an Aztec dance troupe.  They, together with other women, are dancers and drummers and perform various rituals dances.\r\n\r\nAngela is the group leader.  She lives there in San Juan Coajomulco.  She\u2019s 47 years old and has been married 26 years.  She is an artisan and also an Aztec dancer.  She has three children but only two of them still depend on her; her oldest daughter is already married and the other two are studying Indigenous Languages at the university.  She lives in her own house where she also manufactures the crafts.  For example, she makes wood bracelets, rings, necklaces and earrings.  The materials she uses to make them are seeds, thread, beads, wood, etc.\r\n\r\nAngela goes out to sell them at farmers\u2019 markets, for example, and sometimes is able to set up a stand to sell but she usually does it when she dances downtown and she offers her wares to the people who gather round.  The difficult part of what she does is that the people like the products she makes so that they will buy them.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help Angela because she tells us that it provides a source of income to have more profits.  Her goal is to have a locale to sell what she makes as well as being able to manufacture the earrings and all else there.  With the profits she wants to continue providing schooling for her children so that they won\u2019t drop out of school and finish it.\r\n\r\nAngela is also a domestic employee and this is how she helps her husband and her children get ahead and she motivates them to continue making an effort.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":710516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"  To make bracelets, rings, necklaces, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-16T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2500,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yazmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alma Aurea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mara De Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3764.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850161},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7529.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292435},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":7529.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160693},{"amount":625,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":7529.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233567},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3764.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512401}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T05:24:51Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":277686,"name":"Amal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amal T. is married to Fat-hi and is the mother of two daughters and three sons.

She is a farmer and salesperson who has access to many sellers throughout the food business. On her farm, she keeps cows and poultry and has a small cash crop garden and trees. To earn additional income, Edina arranges the logistics of getting farm produce from local farmers to their buyers and makes a commission on those sales.

This usually forms an interesting combination, since the young women tend to listen to the oldest in \"compromising\"  situations, such as when one asks a question in Spanish and the adult women tend to share their know-how with the younger women in moments during the training.  Also, a combination of businesswomen and novices C. be found.  This combination is something very valuable, since the experience and \"tips\" that C. be shared benefit the women without so much experience in business.  \r\n\r\n<P>The great majority of associates inside this group work in the clothes business.  They sell clothes, whether traditional clothes such as long skirts called cortes, typical embroidered blouses called huipiles, cinchos or straps, perrajes or scarves and blouses.  Also some women resell western clothes inside their town.  They buy these clothes buy in the capital or in the regional capitals in order then to sell them in their towns.  In the group there is also one associate that has a shoe store.  \r\n\r\n<P>One of the ladies that sell blouses said that she was going to invest all her loan to buy twenty dozen blouses at Q150 each dozen in order then to resell them for Q180.  Another mentioned that with the Q3000 that she was going to receive, she was going to buy five dozen shoes to supply the inventory of her store.  The initiatives and quantities vary depending on the businesswoman and the size of their business.  \r\n\r\n<P>Something that does not vary a lot is the importance they put on covering the needs of their families and their children.  Among the basic needs of each client are the expense of food, a college scholarship and gas or firewood.  Nevertheless, the largest expense for all the clients is that of food.  Feeding their extensive families is not an easy task.  \r\n\r\n<P>Generating sufficient income in a small town to cover the expenses of an extensive family and also to have money to reinvest in the business is a difficult task.  That is why support is important to these women; so that they C. continue doing well with their business and support their families.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Cuando las mujeres Margaritas de Xesampual entraron a la Agencia de Solola pude notar inmediatamente la combinaci\u00f3n de clientes j\u00f3venes y adultas dentro del grupo. Esto usualmente forma una combinaci\u00f3n interesante ya que las mujeres j\u00f3venes tienden a asistir a las m\u00e1s adultas en situaci\u00f3n \u201ccomprometedoras\u201d como cuando uno le hace una pregunta en espa\u00f1ol y las mujeres adultas tienden a compartir sus conocimientos con las m\u00e1s jovencitas en los momentos de las capacitaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n, se puede encontrar una combinaci\u00f3n de empresarias consolidadas y principiantes. Esta combinaci\u00f3n es algo muy valioso, ya que las experiencias y \u201ctips\u201d se pueden compartir beneficiando a las mujeres sin tanta experiencia en el negocio. \r\n\r\n<P>La gran mayor\u00eda de clientas dentro de este grupo trabaja en el negocio de la ropa. Ellas venden ropa, ya sea ropa tradicional como faldas largas llamadas cortes, blusas t\u00edpicas llamadas huipiles, cinchos o correas, perrajes y blusas. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentran las mujeres que revenden ropa occidental dentro de su pueblo. Aquella ropa la compran en la capital o en las cabeceras departamentales para luego venderlas en sus pueblos. En el grupo tenemos una clienta que tiene una zapater\u00eda.\r\n\r\n<P>Una de las se\u00f1oras que venden blusas dijo que iba a invertir todo su pr\u00e9stamo comprar veinte docenas de blusas a Q150 cada docena para luego revenderla a Q180. Otra mencion\u00f3 que con los Q3000 que iba a prestar iba a comprar cinco docenas de zapatos para surtir el inventario de su tienda. Las iniciativas y cantidades var\u00edan dependiendo de la empresaria y el tama\u00f1o de sus negocios. \r\n\r\n<P>Algo que no varia mucho es la importancia de cubrir las necesidades de sus familias y sus hijos. Entre las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de cada clienta est\u00e1n el gasto de la comida, la colegiatura y el gas o la le\u00f1a. Sin embargo, el gasto m\u00e1s fuerte de todas las clientas es el de la comida. Alimentar a sus extensas familias no es una tarea f\u00e1cil. \r\n\r\n<P>Generar la suficiente cantidad de ingresos en un peque\u00f1o para cubrir los gastos de una familia extensa y adem\u00e1s tener dinero para reinvertirlo en el negocio es una dif\u00edcil tarea. Es por eso que poyar a estas mujeres es importante para que as\u00ed ellas puedan seguir saliendo adelante con sus negocios y apoyar a sus familias."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":156518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

From a very young age, Agueda has been very independent; she always wanted to be self-sufficient, and for this reason she has explored many different trades and occupations. For 15 years she has been in the taxi business, as she is very good at it. Business is going very well and Agueda likes her job, as it allows her to get around the city without any problems, but sometimes the traffic and the chaos in the streets can be very stressful. But Agueda is not only in the taxi business: she also sews various garments in her house. Agueda is very happy with her work and in the future would like to open a pharmacy or a book store, businesses that she could run from her home.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Agueda's tenth loan with MFP.

The official name of this borrowing group is Emely T.'s Group.\r\n\r\nEmely is married and has six grown children. To make a living, Emely owns and operates a general store in the retail sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Emely has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emely joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Emely is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase new items to expand product her offering. This will be Emely's third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

","en":"Isabel, who is going to use her loan to buy cartons of soft drinks, vegetables, meat, cream, cheese and a can of paint, formed the solidarity group called El Puente de la Amistad. Members Ana Maria and Juana are going to buy a bundle of corn.\r\n\r\nIsabel is 58 years old, she studied until the third grade, and lives with her husband and they have 4 older children already working. They live in a very pretty little village with many hills. Many tourists visit in order to buy pottery.\r\n\r\nShe sells food and Mexican antojitos (street snacks). She began her business 10 years ago learning through work how to run an economical kitchen. She bought kitchen utensils little by little, such as saucers, chairs, pots, and dishes to make casseroles, and sauce pans with which to do her work with the income she was taking in. Her business is on a highway, 5 minutes walking distance from her home.\r\n\r\nShe offers her clients who are tourists dobladitas (quick bread, rolled into circles and folded into layers), picaditas (tortilla boats with various fillings) beef jerky, tlacoyas (oval shaped fried cakes made from masa), and beef stew.\r\n\r\nShe likes to give good customer service to her clients, giving them what they ask for. Her business is important because from her profits she pays some of the household expenses. She is also proud of her business because her work allows her to pay for her children\u2019s schooling, right through high school.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because with this loan she is going to paint the premises in order to make a better appearance and she will buy supplies in order to prepare the food and will continue in her business with the best beef stew, and she will keep on investing the income into the business. Her dreams and her hopes are to buy some land and to live well with her family. \r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are grateful to Kiva and the Fundacion Realidad for their help. \u201cThese loans allow us to improve and grow our businesses in order to improve the quality of life for our families.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":876229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks, vegetables, meat, cream, cheese and a can of paint","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-04T23:01:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175.5,"local_amount":2246.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2318.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618884},{"amount":137,"local_amount":1753.63,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573124},{"amount":138.1,"local_amount":1767.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1824.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784835},{"amount":174.4,"local_amount":2232.26,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2304,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193988}],"funded_date":"2011-10-06T02:29:16Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":343293,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes is 44 years old and lives in the Philippines.
