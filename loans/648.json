After working for years in nail salons throughout northern California, Anh made a bold decision to pursue her dream and became her own boss. Anna Kim Chi Beauty Salon has now been in business in downtown Redwood City, California for six years.  \r\n\r\nHer parents doubted her decision to go into business for herself. \u201cMy mother and father were worried and tried to convince me to give this up. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t listen. I was confident and determined to make my salon a success. The more effort you put in, and the braver you are in your life, the more success you will have.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to haircuts, Anh\u2019s salon also provides nails, waxing, and skin-care services. Her salon attracts foot traffic from around the neighborhood, and with her low priced quality services, customers keep coming back. It\u2019s a simple formula, explains Anh. \u201cGood haircuts, good service, and low prices!\u201d On a recent day, Anh proudly wore her \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker from the November 2nd elections as she cut her client\u2019s hair and she proudly boasts, \u201cThis country has been so good for my family. I love to vote!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Anh needed financing to make improvements to her salon, she turned to Opportunity Fund - her local microfinance institution (MFI) - for a small business loan.  Anh learned about Opportunity Fund years ago when her eldest daughter opened a savings account through the non-profit MFI. With a $3,500 loan she will be able to make electrical renovations and bring her salon into compliance with fire codes.  Anh is also excited to have the chance to use a microloan to build her credit.  \u201cI don\u2019t need a lot of money at once, so this is very good. Then, once Opportunity Fund knows me and that I can repay, I\u2019ll be able to get another loan to help with a bigger remodeling job.\u201d

She is 19 years old, and has a high school degree.  She is married and has a son named Bernardo Israel who is 1 years old.  She and her husband have an auto body and requests a loan to increase her business.  She will buy paint, thinner, oil, primer, sandpaper.  She offers services of auto painting, fixing dents, etc.  In addition, she also sells honey, royal jelly (dietary supplement made from bees) and brown sugar.  Her business is called \"The Honey Auto Body Shop.\"  She started this business 5 years ago, and she started selling honey in her body shop 4 years ago.  Her business is a family business; her parents taught her the honey  and royal jelly business, and she inherited the business from them.  \r\n\r\nHer favorite part of the work is selling honey and decorating the containers with lace that she puts on them.  She is proud because she was taught to work hard to succeed.  She sells the most during the vacation periods of April and December. Her customers are tourists, since her business is at the side of a highway and the tourists stop to buy the honey products.  The challenge she faces with her business is the climate, since during the rainy season she cannot get the merchandise because it gets wet. She will use her earnings to invest in the business.  Her business has helped her, because she is not employed, but has her own business and in this way is able to support her son.

She is separated from her husband with whom she had 5 children. As a result of the separation she had to raise them by herself and with minimal help from their father. So she has educated and fed her five children, four of whom are now grown and have their own families, and she only has an 8 year-old daughter in her charge. Her daughter is her reason for working to get ahead day after day. She lives in her own house along with her daughter. \r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s work consists of selling food. Every day in the front yard of her house she sets up her table and grill and starts to prepare her exquisite vegetable stews. Among the things she sells we find Juanes [similar to a tamale], all kinds of grilled items, roasted plantain fritters with pork, and other wonderful foods with her special seasoning and kitchen secrets. She has been doing this most recent job for a year. In addition to this job, she also works for a government agency and has an income from that from that as well. She does it by herself and things are going well for her because she has the two incomes and this allows her to provide a better quality of life for her daughter. What she likes about her job is that it allows her to have an extra income in addition to her salary as a state employee. At first things were a little complicated when she began her business, but little by little she got used to it. Like all women who want to get ahead in life, she has many goals. Her main goal for now is to focus on her business and improve the infrastructure of her house, where she works. She also wants to begin to raise chickens to sell for the end-of-the-year festivities. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is very happy to know that she will have financial help, since this way she will feel more sure of making progress with her business. She also promises once again to make her repayments, as she did with the previous loan she had. With the requested amount of PEN 1,000.00, she will buy ingredients so she can continue to do her job. She will also buy some chicks and feed so she can begin raising them.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":923631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for making food and also baby chickens so she can start raising them for sale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T06:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":159.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":171.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.78,"local_amount":148.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":150.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622063},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836166},{"amount":59.66,"local_amount":159.09,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":161.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245930},{"amount":64.35,"local_amount":171.6,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":173.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099043},{"amount":135.32,"local_amount":360.85,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":365.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456635}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T12:35:42Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":364590,"name":"Adriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adriana naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Ollantaytambo pero vive en la misma ciudad donD. naci\u00f3, ella tiene 60 a\u00f1os D. edad y es casada y fruto D. esta uni\u00f3n tiene seis hijos.  \n\nAdriana desarrolla sus actividades cotidianas y econ\u00f3micas en la ciudad D.

Since her schooling was cut short due to a lack of financial means, she soon undertook an apprenticeship in hairdressing and braiding.  Currently, she is finished with her training and wants to get situated and on her own but doesn\u2019t have the resources.  Nevertheless, with her initiative, she is for the moment successful in doing braids at a crossroads location in order to find substantial revenues for getting situated properly and to open her own workshop.  During the Easter season, when the demand for braids from women and girls is very high, she\u2019s requesting financing for supplies of hair extensions and <i>chouchouvi<\/i>.  Her customers would be able to buy hair extensions directly from her for braiding.  Thus, she will be able to make a profit from selling hair extensions, in addition to her handiwork.  This will enable her to carve out a place for herself under the sun and to rival her friends, who have been able to pursue their schooling.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":303339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Hairdressing and braiding hair ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2009-04-15T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23358.54},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23708.92},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24064.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24425.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24791.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25163.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25541.24},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25924.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26313.22},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26707.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.05,"local_amount":23358.54,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":24060.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52992798},{"amount":49.79,"local_amount":23708.92,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":24420.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63214030},{"amount":50.54,"local_amount":24064.55,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":24787.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73643529},{"amount":51.29,"local_amount":24425.52,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25159.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87083134},{"amount":52.06,"local_amount":24791.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25536.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96999391},{"amount":52.84,"local_amount":25163.78,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25919.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103844767},{"amount":53.64,"local_amount":25541.24,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":26308.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110735849},{"amount":54.44,"local_amount":25924.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26702.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118125634},{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":26313.22,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":27103.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123962029},{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":26707.97,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27510.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128994714}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T16:00:40Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:34:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":105577,"name":"Alumukeng Lumumba Night Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. L.

Having a rich experience in the business, she decided to launch her own a tailoring shop two years ago.\r\n\r\nAs a seamstress who has set up shop in Chisinau City, she is hoping to provide a variety of services to local clients. She employed tailors who actively participate in increasing the business despite nationwide competition. They can offer alterations on prom dresses, bridesmaid dresses, pants, jeans and mess kits. Tatiana enjoys the customers and she really enjoys meeting people and helping them to get what they need to have done.\r\n\r\nTatiana did extensive research before starting up her tailoring shop. She began producing better grades of garments with fine material and a highly qualified workman team. A good quality sewing machine will be her biggest start-up expense. She decided to borrow a loan of 30,000 lei from Microinvest to buy a new sewing machine for new workers where each of them is interested in business

is 31 years old and lives with her husband and three children in the Dornogobi province of Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Her son, age 8, attends a local secondary school while her daughter, age 5, attends kindergarten. Her youngest child is an 8-month-old infant who stays at home. Bolortuya owns and operates a local public bath house. These bath houses are important for local people, as many of them do not have running water with which to bathe. She began her business in 2007 and she earns between 150,000 and 200,000 tugrugs per month. While her business is doing well, it can be expensive to maintain a public bath house. Bolortuya replaced one third of her showers last year, and these repairs make it hard to expand or significantly improve her business. Because of this, she is requesting a 900,000 tugrug loan in order to make repairs and remodel her bath

They live together in their own house. \r\n\r\nFor 28 years, Samuel has grown peas, potatoes, corn, and above all, gladiolas. Just after the harvest, he takes his products to the capital where he has a market stall. He says taking his harvests to Lima is profitable, as the prices there are 100% higher. This permits him to save and to live comfortably. \r\n\r\nSamuel says that at first he did not like agriculture, but when he started his own family, he began to work the fields out of necessity. In the future, he would like to grow more, especially gladiolas, which bring good returns on a small investment. \r\n\r\nThis is Samuel\u2019s eighth loan with MFP and he promises to be punctual with each of his payments. With this money, he will buy a bag of pea seeds, several bags of manure, fertilizers, and bottles of insecticides and fungicides.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":466206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pea seeds, manure, fertilizers, and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T16:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886653}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T21:11:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":171428,"name":"Josephin Epifania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Josephin labora en la Alcaldia Municipal de Nueva Guinea, es madre de 3 ni\u00f1os: Lesly que estudia 5to grado de primaria, Johathan de 14 a\u00f1os en 3er a\u00f1o de secundaria y Franklin de 15 a\u00f1os estudiando el 4to as\u00f1o de secundaria; requiere financiamiento para mejorar su casa y espera contar con el apoyo de kiva para realizar este peque\u00f1o proyecto, pues desea ponerle ceramica a la casa y mejorar la cocina.

Here, everyone knows the \u201cLos Pajaritos\u201d [Little Birds] store owned by Osvaldo O. P., 42 years of age. His father started the business 30 years ago when he lost his job. He began selling household food products and miscellaneous items. At that time, Osvaldo\u2019s brother worked at the store, and Osvaldo has been in charge for the last five years. With much discipline and effort, he has managed to make a living. \r\n\r\nAlthough Los Pajaritos sells groceries and household items, on the weekends cold drinks make up the greatest volume of sales and profits, making the business profitable for the whole month. Also, the customers like that the prices are lower than those offered by the competition.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo is applying for his third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy grocery items like sugar, rice, flour, canned goods, grains, and cooking oil in bulk. By buying in quantity, he can get special discounts and stock up the store. With his previous loans, he was able to get the business off the ground, as it had been stagnant due to a lack of working capital. Now, Osvaldo can offer a wide variety of products to his customers.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo\u2019s dreams and goals are to increase his income to provide for his family. For this reason, all of his loan will be invested in the store, to keep it growing. For Osvaldo, life has constant challenges. Sometimes he feels that he needs more money for things he desires, but because he has many responsibilities, he knows he must wait.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk,

They tell us that this is because during harvest time all the women go to their fields to pick lemons together.  It is located in the community of Paso Rinc\u00f3n, San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec, in the state of Oaxaca.  It has 6 members who know each other because they all live in the same town and pick lemons together.

Do\u00f1a \u201cLeo,\u201d as she\u2019s known in her community has a small corn mill that all the women in her community come to use to grind corn to make tortillas and a small plot of land that she grows lemons on.  She needs the loan to buy fertilizers and manure for her crops.  She also needs a few sacks of corn to sell at the mill.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a \u201cLeo\u201d wakes up every day at 5am to open the mill and grind corn for her customers.  The mill is located in her house.  She hopes in the future to buy a new mill because the one she has breaks down sometimes.  Leonarda is a very cheerful woman who very much wants to work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Angelina P. O., 67, is another member of the Mujeres Unidas group.  She only got to third grade.  Angelina lives just with her 10 year old grandson who is in fifth grade.  She is a lemon farmer and needs the loan to buy fertilizers and manure for her crops.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a \u201cGela,\u201d as she\u2019s called by her friends, tells us that December is the month when profits from the lemons are highest because lemons are scarce then due to the cold.  Her farm plot is 200 meters from her house.  She hopes that her grandson will be able to go to the university in the future to become a great engineer.\r\n\r\nThe other four members are: Rosa Elvira M. P., Nelly Marisol M.

Twenty years ago, she arrived in Cartagena de Indias from the city of Amurallada in search of a better future.  Elizabeth wanted so much to study in order to become a professional, but she had difficulty gaining admission into the university.  Her friends recommended that she learn how to sew and now she says that she is happy that she made that decision.  Elizabeth has excelled because the experience she has gained as an independent entrepreneur allows her to generate her own income for covering the household expenses.  At the moment, Elizabeth also sells a variety of merchandise through specialized catalogs.

This is 40 years old Esili M. from Kyela, married with five children between the ages of 12 and 25. Esili has been running a rice business since 2004. Working at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week, she currently earns about $100 a month and is now requesting a loan of $375 in order to purchase rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the variety of crops she sells. Esili thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T18:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esili M.

In addition, her house has six rooms which she has rented for the last year; she does this to help her husband defray household expenses.

She lives with her husband in a community called Hern\u00e1ndez, which is in Los Chiles, Alajuela province.  This community is noted for its mountains, great landscapes, and high humidity; in addition, it is on the road very close to the northern border of our country.  Major economic activities are ranching and agriculture.  Specifically, they grow basic grains, tubers and oranges.\r\n\r\nSince she was a girl, Keila rose every day at 4:30 in the morning to milk the family cows because dairy farming has always been a part of her life.  She assures us that there is plenty of demand in her community for the milk of her cows, and, indeed, her parents used dairy farming to support their family.  Now, Kelia wishes to have her own business, and with more cows, she would be able to increase production and take advantage of her experience and skill.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Kelia wishes to obtain a small loan of 641,000 colones ($1,200), with which she will buy five more cows and expand her business.  She hopes that this expansion will allow her to buy the small house of her dreams.\r\n\r\nKelia is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Unidos por un Desarrollo (Group of Communal Credit United for Development), one of 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is her second loan, and she hopes to prosper personally and economically.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, farming and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Rodrigo C., who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 11 to  29 years old. \r\n\r\nMarrieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marrieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $214, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy feed for the pigs and inventory for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Marrieta C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Every day she distributes her products from very early in the morning.  She takes charge of distributing in the village where they live while her husband leaves on his bicycle to distribute their products in the nearby towns such as Santiago and San Lucas.  In this way he does not generate additional expenses for transportation.  Now she relies on twelve cows and two young calves.  She works as a group with her husband who helps to milk the cows and to feed them every day.  They do not worry about the space for their animals since they have an extensive plot of land that is at the rear part of their house in order to be able to take care of their stock better.  She has been performing this work already for a little over 10 years, by which she has developed an extensive knowledge of the work.  Now she needs another loan to buy another cow to extend the production of milk and cheese, since, as she says, thanks to God they already have a clientele to which they supply their products.

It is here we find Dalia. She is 45, married and has five children, two of whom are adults and the youngest three are ages 13, 7 and 3 and in school. Her husband works at a mechanic's shop. Dalia makes a living raising chickens and pigs on the small farm she has at her house. She tells us she gets up to 100 chickens a season, which she buys when they're little at a commercial center in the village and then raises them for a time until they're ready to sell. She sells the birds out of her home to people who come there and if not she plucks them and takes them to the market to sell to the local merchants. Her husband takes care of the pigs and then they sell the meat out of their home to neighbors and acquaintances. Dalia tells us that she has six years of experience with this job. She plans to use the loan to purchase chickens as well as feed and medicines for both the chickens and the pigs to ensure they have a good development. She has been with the community bank for eight years and she enjoys it because the loans have helped her a lot. Her goals are to keep making headway and to have good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":860494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chickens as well as feed and medicine for chickens and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalia Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797943},{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":288.75,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":290.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238609035},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563305},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774280}],"funded_date":"2011-09-06T12:48:45Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":335916,"name":"Kayelye Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme Salamata est la repr\u00e9sentante du groupe KAYELYE.

She now has 4 children and since then she has dedicated herself to different occupations and activities with the help her life long companion, her husband.  Five years ago she decided to dedicate herself to the sale of packaging, and products that she distributed and offered exclusively during the times of fairs in different towns and to villagers that lie around the city.  She started selling in small quantities.  Little by little due to the good service she provided and her charismatic character she continued increasing the quantity of her clients, therefore increasing her income for her home.  In addition to this activity, the days she has free she dedicates herself to offering sewing services and the sale of chocolates.  This generates an additional income for the education of her children.  What Mrs. Lourde hopes is to have a packaging wholesale distribution store.  This work would permit her to be much more close to her family, generate more income, and offer them a better quality of life.  This is why Mrs. Laura is soliciting a loan of $425 dollars, money that she will use to refurbish the location she is trying to open for the packaging wholesale distribution store, and she is promising to pay back the loan in 6 months.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\nLa se\u00f1ora laura actualmente tiene  41 a\u00f1os form\u00f3 su familia a la edad de 19 y fruto del matrimonio ahora tiene 4 hijos, desde entonces se dedic\u00f3  a diversas  ocupaciones y actividades siempre con el apoyo de su compa\u00f1ero de toda la vida, su esposo.Hace ya 5 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3  dedicarse a la venta de abarrotes, productos que distribu\u00eda y ofrec\u00eda exclusivamente en los d\u00edas de feria  por los diferentes pueblos  aleda\u00f1os a la ciudad donde radica, empez\u00f3 vendiendo en peque\u00f1as cantidades y poco a poco por la buena atenci\u00f3n que brindaba  y su car\u00e1cter carism\u00e1tico  fue incrementando la cantidad de  clientes y por ende aumentando los ingresos  econ\u00f3micos para su hogar \r\nadicionalmente a esta actividad  los d\u00edas  en los que dispone de m\u00e1s tiempo se  dedica a ofrecer  los servicios  de costura y venta de chocolates trabajo que le genera un ingreso adicional  para la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.

They have various businesses, among others selling cloth, high quality \"pagnes\" (lengths of brightly colored African print cloth) and damask fabric, fruit, firewood, dyed products, etc. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this new loan they expect to buy 3 wagonloads of firewood, 7 bolts of \"pagnes\", 5 outfits made out of damask, 6 stalks of bananas, 10 baskets of fruit, 20 cloth suits and 4 packs of coloring and ingredients for doing dyeing. They buy their goods at the market in Bamako, in M\u00e9dine in the town of Sikasso and surrounding neighborhoods. <P>\r\n\r\nThe merchandise is sold in the various markets of Sikasso and out of their families to a clientele composed of men and women, mostly for cash. They do their dyeing in their families' homes. They each expect to make an average monthly of 22,500 F CFA of which part will be used for family needs and the rest reinvested in their businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nThe ambition of some of the women of the Danaya group is to be able to buy a lot on which to build a house; other members would like to start up businesses on their own. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":312205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of various articles for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253945.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020239},{"amount":254.18,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242995},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678774},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112607},{"amount":254.15,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028172}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T16:02:40Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":109705,"name":"Rosina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosina O. is married and has three children.

trabaja transportando carga y pasajeros en su mototaxi. El nos comenta que empez\u00f3 alquilando mototaxis y que con sus ahorros pudo adquirir la suya hace cuatro a\u00f1os. Usualmente trabaja dentro de la ciudad aunque a veces tambi\u00e9n en rutas que unen la ciudad con sus caser\u00edos aleda\u00f1os.\n\nPor otro lado trabaja eventualmente como obrero. El es consciente de que si quiere ver a su familia progresar tiene que dar todo de si para sacarlos adelante. El continuo uso otorgado a su veh\u00edculo ha hecho que presenta algunas fallas que requieran de reparacion urgente, por ello se encuentra solcitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 800 nuevos soles.\n\nElvis es un padre honrado, empe\u00f1oso y trabajador. Su m\u00e1s grande anhelo es poder instalar una bodega en su casa para brindarle a su familia ingresos estables con los cuales puedan mantenerse. Ya ha trabajado anteriormente con nosotros y ha demostrado puntualidad y responsabilidad al momento de asumir sus cuotas.\n","en":"Elvis, 27, lives with his wife and their two children.  He has a three year old and a one year old.  They live in the Paij\u00e1n distict, Ascope province, in the La Libertad area.  It is located three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked transporting cargo and passengers in his \u201cmototaxi\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle) for ten years.  He tells us that he started by renting mototaxis.  Four years ago he was able to get his own with his savings.  He usually works within the city, although at times he also works routes that run from the city to the neighboring areas.\r\n\r\nHe sometimes works as a workman.  He is aware of the fact that if he wants to see his family progress, he needs to give all of himself to get them ahead.  The continual use of his vehicle has caused some defects that need to be repaired urgently.  That is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 800 PEN.\r\n\r\nElvis is an honest and hard-working father.  His greatest desire is to be able to set up a convenience store in his house in order to give his family stable income to be able to support themselves.  He has worked with us previously, and he has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with his payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":477170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Pay expenses of repair and maintenance for his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan -

He is the main income provider for his family. He has 27 years of experience working as a farmer, having had his own farm since 1995. He uses plastic tents to grow his products. These tents also allow him to better monitor product quality as well as to grow his products for more months during the year. He works independently in his business. Today, he is requesting a loan of $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase needed supplies for his farm and a special machine to cultivate the land. He estimates that the loan will help him increase his profits by 15%. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

He has five years of experience working with mobile phones. He began as an employee in a mobile shop and opened his own store in 2007. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to increase his merchandise selection and purchase prepaid telephone cards to sell. The majority of mobile phone users in Lebanon purchase these prepaid cards. In the future, he is looking to further expand his business and increase his capital. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (for example, blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture and not indicating his name and location). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

vive en su casa propia junto a su esposa Demetria de 42 a\u00f1os y sus 02 queridos hijos, quienes son el motivo de todos sus esfuerzos. Todas las ma\u00f1anas, desde muy temprano, Juan sale a trabajar a su chacra, sabe que tiene que poner todo su esfuerzo en hacer m\u00e1s f\u00e9rtil sus tierras, para poder obtener una buena cosecha. Sus productos, como la hoja de coca, el caf\u00e9 y el cacao, los vende a los centros de acopio en la ciudad de San Francisco, donde tiene cuantiosos compradores, debido a la buena calidad de sus cultivos. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es sembrar sus tierras y lo hace con mucha paciencia, lleva 20 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es fumigar sus tierras, ya que siempre corre el riesgo de que los productos qu\u00edmicos le causen alguna enfermedad en lo futuro. En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los jornaleros para que de esa manera tenga mayor avance en cuanto a su trabajo. Con el tiempo desea comprar nuevas tierras, para aumentar su producci\u00f3n. Es su tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, en su primer pago fue muy puntual y espera poder serlo ahora tambi\u00e9n, es de los pocos varones de su banco comunal, por lo cual es muy apreciado por el resto de las socias. Con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado comprara trampas y mallas para combatir la plaga de insectos que asechan sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"Juan is 42 years old and from Palmapampa district.  He is a very truthful and hard-working man who lives in his own home together with his wife, 42 year-old Demetria, and his two beloved children who are the reason for all his efforts.\r\n\r\nEvery day, very early in the morning, Juan goes out to work on his farm.  He knows that he has to put all his effort into making his land fertile so that he can obtain a good harvest.  He sells his produce, such as coca leaf, coffee and cacao, in the warehouses in the city of San Francisco where he has lots of buyers owing to the good quality of his crops.\r\n\r\nWhat Juan most enjoys about his work is sowing his land and he does this with a lot of patience.  He has been in this business for 20 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be spraying his land with chemicals since he runs the risk of some of the chemicals making him sick in the future.\r\n\r\nAt harvest time, Juan has the support of day laborers so that he can advance more quickly in his work.  Over time, he would like to buy new land so that he can increase his production.\r\n\r\nThis is Juan's third loan from MFP.  He was very punctual in repaying his first loan and he hopes to be punctual in repaying this loan too.  He is one of few men in his community bank, for which reason he is very much appreciated by the other members.  Juan will use his loan to buy traps and netting to fight the pests that are threatening his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":761276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy traps and netting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-02T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2545.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666047}],"funded_date":"2011-05-05T11:54:56Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":299040,"name":"Flores Magon Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Clementina pidi\u00f3 un pr\u00e9stamo a la financiera para comprar productos de abarrotes como papel higi\u00e9nico, refresco, aceite, chiles en vinagre, huevo, arroz, tambi\u00e9n vende un poco de carnes fr\u00edas, y dulces de diferentes sabores; comenta que los d\u00edas jueves y viernes vende cenas como pozole y corundas (comida de la regi\u00f3n) ella tiene su tienda desde hace baproximadamente 13 a\u00f1os y emprendi\u00f3 este negocio por que una se\u00f1ora que era su vecina vend\u00eda abarrotes y se cambio de casa y no hab\u00eda cerca de ah\u00ed otra tienda entonces do\u00f1a Clementina se le ocurri\u00f3 poner una mesita de dulces y poco a poco fue invirtiendo en sus abarrotes y de ah\u00ed fue surtiendo, dice que gracias a los prestamos que le ha realizado la financiera ella a incrementado sus ganancias ya que ha surtido art\u00edculos que no vend\u00eda.

She also sells some cold meats and different sweet treats.  She tells us that on Thursdays and Fridays she sells dinners such as 'pozole' and 'corundas' (meals from her region). \r\n\r\nClementina has owned her grocery store for approximately 13 years and started the business because a neighbor of hers used to sell groceries.  Her neighbor moved house and there wasn't another store nearby.  Clementina therefore thought to set up a table selling sweet treats.  She gradually invested in groceries and stocked her business.  She says that, thanks to her loans from the institution, she has increased her profits as she has managed to stock up with items that she didn't used to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The city is famous for the legendary L\u00edneas de Nazca (Nazca Lines), a series of ancient, immense and unexplainable hieroglyphics carved in the desert that surrounds the city.  Generally they are attributed to the Nazca culture that inhabited the region between 300 and 800 AD.  As such, the city attracts considerable tourism.  But Nazca is also known for its hard-working people who have remained calm despite the frequent earthquakes, tsunamis and high level of poverty in the region.  Delia's common-law husband who works as a receptionist at a hotel in the city.  He supports her in everything she does and together they take care of the household expenses.  They have two children, the eldest of which is 9 and in second grade.  The youngest is 2 and too young for school but, according to Delia, he is mischievous and playful.\r\n\r\nDelia sells sodas and beer for a living and has been in business for about a year.  She has had constant support from her husband who encouraged her to get started since this type of business is well received in the neighborhood.  Her work also allows her to be near her children.

Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.  Gertruda works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week and currently earns about 160USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to purchase rastas and cosmetics for her salon. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Getruda thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rastas and cosmetics for her salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Getruda M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613693},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010772},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233058},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664849},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105561},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022683}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T06:30:24Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105625,"name":"Eupricina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eupricina M. a 51-year-old fish and vegetable vendor.

village in Takeo province. Mrs. Chrev H. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a pig breeder. Since this business is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy piglets. She will use the rest of the loan to buy fertilizer to support the field to make her crop more productive. Her husband, Mr. Teng Khloung, is a farmer and he also helps his wife in her current business. Mrs. Chrev H. is 39 years old and the mother of three children who are all attending the local school. All the members are presented in the picture. \r\n\r\nFifteen members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans and one has a monthly payment loan. The fifteen members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

She is grateful to Afodenic for the support provided by this loan, which will be of great benefit to her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":477217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of notebooks, pencils, crayons, erasers, liquid paper, rulers, poster board, backpacks, calculators, and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T17:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johana Del Transito","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.4,"local_amount":2324.86,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2328.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874594},{"amount":60.95,"local_amount":1271.98,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1273.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604458},{"amount":56.61,"local_amount":1181.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1183.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821712},{"amount":59.15,"local_amount":1234.36,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1236.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561720},{"amount":160.42,"local_amount":3347.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3353.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770645},{"amount":126.47,"local_amount":2639.51,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2643.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465418}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T18:34:57Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:44:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":175702,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. C. tiene 60 a\u00f1os, esta casado con la Sra.

They chose this name because they like to fight to achieve their goals, and they very much identify with it. They are located in the community of Valle del Chalco in the State of Mexico. It is a close-knit group with a lot of communication among the members.\r\n\r\nThe group representative is Mr. Valent\u00edn Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda (the man in the blue jacket), who is 32 years old and is proudly from the state of Oaxaca. He is single and sells tacos. He began working in a position that lasted two years, but he later decided to become independent and start his own business, which has been in operation for six years. He goes out each day with his cart to sell tacos, beginning at six o'clock in the evening. During the week he makes few sales, but his best days for sales are on weekends when he sometimes runs out of tacos in just three hours. He always tries to get good prices on his ingredients and provide high quality. His dreams are to be able to buy a small house for himself and, at some point, for his future family. He also wants to open a new taco stand in another community and create a job for someone, given that he sees that it is difficult to get a job right now.

Pascual works in agriculture, growing corn in the area of San Carlos.

He has been lucky enough to find a parcel of land in the village of San Carlos, where he, with the help of his children, works in agriculture. His children work half of the day while they are in school.

la arena se empieza a deslavar y es lodo por todos lados. La gente del grupo vive cerca una de otra, entonces son buenos vecinos, y esa fue la razon por la que se reunieron y formaron un grupo de credito, lo llamaron \"Las Conchitas\" porque son mujures de la comunidad Concepci\u00f3n (de cari\u00f1o es concha).\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Maria es la tesorera del grupo y ella nos cuenta su historia de su negocio, la se\u00f1ora tiene una tienda general, vende dulces, refrescos, pan , leche etc, todo lo referente a una abarroteria, su tienda es peque\u00f1a, tambien tiene un molino de Nixtamal, como en las comunidades  acostumbran que para comer las se\u00f1oras hagan tortillas echas a mano,no compran en una tortilleria, y necesitan un molino que muela el nixtamal para poder hacer la tortilla y do\u00f1a Maria tiene ese molino para que la gente pueda moler el nixtamal, en su negocio tiene poco mas de 8 a\u00f1os y sus dificultades son la competencia de otras tiendas y algunas gentes que tambien tiene un molino; aparte de esto nos menciona que le han llegado casos en los que le pagan con billetes falsos y ella no se da cuenta y pierde mucho dinero, tambi\u00e9n debe pagar el mantenimiento o las composturas que podr\u00eda tener su molino, quiere un credito nuevo para poder pagar el mantenimiento de su molino y comprar mercancia para su tienda y quiere vender cosas nuevas, el proposito que tiene es mejorar dia con dia y comprar unos anaqueles para poder tener su tienda bien arreglada y poder vender mas mercancia, espera poder tener mas ganancias ya que tiene una meta fija y es darles el estudio a sus hijos.\n\nDo\u00f1a Maria tiene 3 hijos en la escuela y quiere apoyarlos con sus pasajes, vive en union libre con su esposo desde hace 15 a\u00f1os, tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, tambien vive con su familia en casa propia y su esposo trabaja, por eso do\u00f1a Maria lo apoya con lo que gana en su tienda. \nLos nombres de sus demas compa\u00f1eras del grupo son los siguientes y tambien de sus actividades.\n1.-Ana Luisa, tiene un molino de Nixtamal\n2.-Valentina, cria y vende borregos\n3.-Maria Eleuteria, tiene un molino de nixtamal\n4.-Maria Modesta, tiene una tienda general\n5.-Rosa, tiene una papeleria\n6.-Felipa, cria y vende caballos\n7.-Maria Guadalupe, vende jugos frescos\n8.-Juana, vende verduras\n9.-Nicolasa, cria y vende borregos.","en":"The following group is called \u201cLas Conchitas\u201d and has 10 members, all women.  The group is located in the community of Concepci\u00f3n Chico.  The community is somewhat large but it\u2019s on a hill.  The main road is paved but during the rainy season sand starts to wash off and there is mud everywhere.  People in the group live near each other so are good neighbors and this is the reason they joined together and formed a credit group.  They called it \u201cLas Conchitas\u201d because they are women from the community of Concepci\u00f3n (whose lovable nickname is Concha).\n\nMar\u00eda is the group Treasurer and she relates the story behind her business.  She has a general store where she sells candy, soft-drinks, bread, milk, etc; everything related to groceries.  Her store is small but she also owns a nixtamal (dough made from corn used for tortillas, tamales, etc.) mill.  It\u2019s customary out in the communities for the women to make hand-made tortillas and not to buy them at a tortilla shop.  They need a mill that will grind the corn so that they can make tortillas and Mar\u00eda has that mill so that people can grind their corn.  She\u2019s been in business a little more than 8 years and the difficulty she faces is competition from other stores and from individuals who also own mills.  Aside from that, she also mentions that on occasion she\u2019s been paid with counterfeit bills and she doesn\u2019t notice and loses a lot of money.  She also has to pay to service and repair the mill.  She wants a new loan to pay to service the mill and to buy stock items for her store; she wants to sell new products.  Her goal is to improve day to day and to buy some shelving to arrange her store nicely and be able to sell more merchandise.  She hopes to have more profits because her fixed goal is to provide schooling for her children.\n\nMar\u00eda has three children in school and she wants to support them with their transportation costs.  She\u2019s lived with her husband in a common law relationship for the last 15 years.  She\u2019s 43 years old.  She lives with her family in her own house.  Her husband works too and this is why Mar\u00eda helps him out with what she earns in the store.\n\nThe other group members and their activities are:\n\n1.-Ana Luisa, has a nixtamal mill\n2.-Valentina, raises sheep to sell\n3.-Maria Eleuteria, has a nixtamal mill\n4.-Maria Modesta, has a general store\n5.-Rosa, has a stationery shop\n6.-Felipa, raises and sells horses\n7.-Maria Guadalupe, sells fresh fruit juice\n8.-Juana, sells vegetables\n9.-Nicolasa, raises and sells sheep.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":819100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to service a nixtamal mill and to buy merchandise for a general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eleuteria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1293.75,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15097.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201856},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10064.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807448},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10064.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618542},{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5032.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572787}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T04:40:17Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":323644,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 31 years old and is married to Samuel.

Ligia purchases her products in the city of Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, and then has the goods shipped.

With this loan, Ligia will be able to respond promptly to her customers and preserve the good reputation that she enjoys for being a businesswoman who fulfills her orders quickly.

Paulina thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase phone accessories ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613700},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010779},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233065},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664856},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105568}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T12:55:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":105641,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet P. is a store owner in Sto.

For the past 4 years she has dedicated herself to attending to her small grocery store, while also selling food; her business is out of her home, which is located in a high traffic and commercial area in her neighborhood. Midday is when she has the most clients, and it is because of this that often her husband helps, however, he cannot do this every day because he has his own work. Miriam works hard to organize her time given that she has to cook the food that she offers, attend to her store, and also has to drop off and pick up her small daughter from kindergarten.
