He is married and has a 26-year-old child. To make a living, Edwin owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Edwin has been engaged in his business for over 22 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nEdwin joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edwin is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase seeds, fertilizers and other farm inputs. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Edwin from CEVI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is true for her both in her business, family life, and Christian ministry. Norly gives her fullest to achieve success in her business, even as she actively participates in the weekly Bible fellowships and entrepreneurial activities in CCT*. Norly remains single. She resides in Pasay City with the family she has grown up with.\r\n\r\nNorly manages a \u201csari-sari\u201d store into which she pours out her focus. She has this little space adjacent to their home where she displays her products, ranging from eggs to detergents to soft drinks\u2014anything her valued customers would need. She sells a lot in her community, being able to come up with PHP18,000 net income per month. Norly has managed to run the business alone for ten years now.\r\n\r\nIn order to give more and more of her potential towards improving her store, Norly has to outsource more finances to back up her funds. She then decided to loan PHP12, 000 with the help of CCT. With these new funds, she intends to purchase more goods for her store. This will include cases of soft drinks, boxes of canned goods, and sachets of detergents and fabric conditioners. It is important for Norly that her shelves are full of products, as these will attract more customers to her store and still retain the regular ones. Because of the loan, she is able to sustain her business and make sure that she does not run out of products to sell. The loan enables her to buy the things she needs to sustain her lifestyle.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Norly faces, which is common to running sari-sari stores, is following up the debts of regular customers. Also, it is a struggle for her whenever she gets sick and weak, to run the store. But it is her goal to turn the store into a grocery. It is going to take her full effort to make it happen. \r\n\r\nNorly also desires to give her full commitment to the Christian ministry, where she belongs, and it has become of great help to her family. Included in her goals list are an owned house and a transportation vehicle for her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":778894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more goods for her sari-sari store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3800.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474148},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636929},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2714.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005239},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764412},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571546}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T02:29:10Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":306875,"name":"Felix Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e9lix, habita en la comarca el Rosario, localizada en Pueblo Nuevo municipio de Estel\u00ed, tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, de oficio agricultor, tiene tres hijos.

She is noted as being a very cheerful and sincere woman.  She lives in her own home together with her husband Rolando and her youngest son, 22 year-old Gerardo, who she loves very much.\r\n\r\nNora's business is weaving handicrafts.  She has a sales stall in the craft center in San Pedro de Cajas.  This is where she sells the items that she makes and they are bought very quickly by her customers since the designs that she makes are very original.  She also stocks her business with a variety of loom-produced crafts and tapestries from other craftspeople in her area.\r\n\r\nWhat Nora most enjoys about her work is weaving and developing her creativity.  She has been in this business for seven years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to spend the whole day on her sales stall without being able to go out.  However, this does not discourage her since she knows that she has to sell her products as quickly as she can so that she can take some time out every 20 days as her husband arrives home from the mine where he works and they are able to share most of their time together.\r\n\r\nNora also farms.  She grows potatoes once a year.  With all the goals that she is achieving, over time Nora hopes to be able to set up a larger store where she can serve her customers more comfortably.  She is a member of the \"Mujeres al Futuro\" community bank and this is her seventh loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  She is very punctual in making her loan repayments.  With your support, Nora will invest the money that she has requested in buying several skeins of ram's wool and alpaca wool so that she can continue weaving her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":808932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy ram's wool and alpaca wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-13T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1511.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712719}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T16:16:35Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":319168,"name":"Sypros","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sypros, 32 years old and married to George, has been operating her general store for the past eight years, earning a monthly income of about KES 20,000 which she uses to take care of her business and family. <p>\r\n\r\nWith a loan of KES 25,000 from KADET LTD.

In the recent 2011 season, Mildred had a very good maize yield harvesting 12 bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Mildred was only able to harvest five bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Mildred and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Mildred will educate her children and invest in business and livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Saidia SHG group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Mildred is pictured with her group members. Standing on the far left is the field officer.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":921339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodgers","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barasa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":364278,"name":"Lydia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia's group comprises three hard-working women.

The problem with her business is that she has given credit, and many people have not paid.  She does not have adequate funding, and she has little inventory.  That is why she wants to buy basic grains and cosmetics like lipstick, shadow, nail polish, powder, and cologne.  She also wants to buy canned goods to prepare food.  She hopes to be able to sell more and get more customers.  With what has happened, she will not sell anymore on credit.  She has a responsibility to the institution to make monthly payments, and she has to pay basic expenses like water, light, and telephone.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to be able to make her sales grow so that in the future her daughter can depend upon her own business.

She is 57 years old and married to George, 50, who is a fisherman.  She is a loving mother of an only child, King, who is 15 years old and a high school student. She lives in the town of Tanay, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with an opportunity of having startup capital for generating income. During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested it in planting vegetables and a hog raising business. Both businesses gave her a reasonable income, but it was lost due to a storm last September 2009.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, she requests 15,000 PHP for the recovery of her planting business and to also start hog fattening. Specifically, the amount will be use for both businesses. This loan will help her business, which was destroyed by huge typhoons \u201dOndoy\u201d and \u201cSanti\u201d. \r\n\r\nAs a mother, Nenita dreams of sending her son to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for a better life. She also enjoys that the loan from ASHI will change their lives and accommodate her family's needs. Through the support of ASHI, a Kiva partner, she hopes to continue reaching for her

food vending businesses.  She lives in Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. Violeta is borrowing PHP 21,000 to fund operations. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Violeta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

","en":"Saodatkhon is a smart and honest woman.  She is a widow and is loving mother of three children.  It is hard for her to provide for her children by herself, but, despite the difficulties, she works diligently to provide a good quality of life for them.  In order to earn money and support her family, Saodatkhon became involved in retail sales at the market.

It was a well-made skirt and captivated the people who saw it.  Since that day she has received various orders for her embroidered skirts. <p> \r\nToday Maria's dream is to continue producing, at a better quantity and quality, her orders, which have increased due to the upcoming Festival in her area.

This is also the work of her husband, who occasionally helps her to embroider the skirts, when Maria runs out of supplies. They have 3 children and she is 33 years old, she has so much ahead of her.  The loan she is requesting is to purchase supplies of fabric, colored thread, frames, sequins, and beads, which are the necessary materials to make her skirts.

There are days when he does not return home, something that is very common among agricultural workers.  It is something that Ortizer is accustomed to since he has spent more than 30 years doing it.  However, when the production bears many fruits it is gratifying.  It is the result of his work and dedication, of overcoming difficulties, cleaning and maintaining his productive lands.<p>\r\n\r\nOrtizer has a great love for his wife, who is the most important person for him and who motivates him day after day.  With the money that he is seeking, he is thinking about increasing his production and growing a greater quantity and variety of products typical of the region so that he and his wife can be secure in their old age.<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Conover, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":201018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To increase the quantity and variety of agricultural products for his land ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-17T18:11:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ortizer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-01T19:39:20Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":168.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335933},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":168.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957111},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":168.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227361},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":168.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422596},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":168.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115819},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":168.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010784},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594593},{"amount":56.26,"local_amount":162.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989222}],"funded_date":"2008-09-17T19:39:20Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Conover","image":172521}},{"id":68415,"name":"Galo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Galo S., 37 years old, is married with four children.

She has been very responsible with her payments to the communal bank. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting now, Hermelinda will purchase parts needed for her cars, and will take them to the mechanic for maintenance.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maria B., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":231186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Paying for auto parts and maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-29T03:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":772.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594990}],"funded_date":"2008-11-29T18:48:42Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Barraza","image":null}},{"id":80705,"name":"Andr\u00e9 Rosalina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Andr\u00e9 Rosalina Z. \u00e9 natural de Maputo, tem 37 anos de idade, \u00e9 casado maritalmente e pai de 3 filhos, com idade entre 11, 9 e 2 anos respectivamente.

Luego debido a su edad tuvo que dejar el trabajo y esto lo motiv\u00f3 a buscar nuevas opciones con las que pueda seguir manteniendo a los suyos.\n\nLa constante demanda por parte de sus clientes ha hecho que Manuel piense en comprar m\u00e1s sacos de polvillo con los que pueda ampliar su negocio.

He lives with his wife and his 5-year-old grandson in the La Pava farming community, Mochum\u00ed district, which is an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.  For the past 6 years he has sold sacks of polvillo (a type of animal feed derived from rice).  He acquires his merchandise in Chiclayo's rice mills and sells it primarily to stores in Mochum\u00ed and among his neighbors who raise animals.  This is his only source of income with which he supports his family.  He has told us that he used to work in a mill before starting his current business but, due to his age, had to leave his job in the mill and seek new options with which to continue supporting his loved ones.  His customers' constant demands have motivated Manuel to buy more sacks of polvilo with which to enlarge his business.  For this reason, he is asking Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 new soles to reach his goal. Manuel is hard-working and responsible.  His greatest wish is to continue growing as a merchant and to provide his family with the quality of life they need.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":421820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase polvillo (an animal feed derived from rice).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Pava -

O. is a married lady with three children aged between nine years old and three years old. Her business is located at Manyatta, a busy market in Kisumu. Kisumu is in Nyanza province and boarders Western Kenya. The region is well known for production of Tilapia fish and Omena from lake victoria. \r\n\r\nBenter owns a general store in which she sells such items as rice, sugar, cooking oil and detergents. She has been in this kind of business for three years now and sells to the local households. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is low income as her customers thus cannot afford to buy the items frequently, hence slowing down stock movement.

Other desires of his are to have a tailoring workshop with enough business to hire people who really need the work and who are determined in this moment of their lives to work through difficult situations.

He wants to move forward for his family, an idea he most wants to realize and which he keeps in mind to help him succeed.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Sebasti\u00e1n works as a tailor making suits and pants for men and women.  He has worked in this business for 30 years.  When he was young he attended classes in a nearby school and in the afternoon would go to work in a tailoring shop.  Because of his parents\u2019 economic situation, he had to discontinue his studies.  But he continued in the sewing workshop with the idea that he could pay for his studies that way.  And so he became a tailor and set up his own business in his house.  With the financing he will invest in his workshop, little by little, and increase his production of different styles of suits.  Another thing he needs to do is to buy an industrial sewing machine that produces work of a higher quality that would in turn bring in more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Melissa Hays, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":220210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-11-09T02:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-23T10:05:02Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":11000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":11000,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":11338.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935114}],"funded_date":"2008-11-09T10:05:02Z","paid_date":"2009-01-15T22:24:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Hays","image":null}},{"id":76625,"name":"Salom\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Salom\u00f3n tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, habitante Hialeah, de estado civil soltero con un hijo de 15 a\u00f1os de edad, actualmente estudia y le ayuda a su padre en sus tiempos libres.

She is the mother of four grown children, three of whom live in their own houses. One still lives with his mother along with his wife and their children. Teresa has spent more than 30 years running a general store, which enabled her to raise and educate all of her children, as she was widowed 30 years ago. The general store where Teresa works is one of the oldest in her neighborhood, which has brought her many customers. Today, her concern is not her children but rather the grandchildren that live with her. She hopes to give them everything she gave her own children--an education that will enable them to face life independently. Like so many other microentrepreneurs, however, she does not have the support of banking institutions because she does not meet their requirements. For this reason, she has returned to Adephca and Kiva to finance the purchase of the following products: 2 quintals of Frijoles @ $40\/each; 3 quintals of American rice @ $61\/each; 3 quintals of flour @ $50\/each; 3 cases of La Lechera milk @ $45\/each; 5 cases of Maruchan soup @ $12\/each; 4 cases of eggs @ $35\/each; 2 dozen units of instant coffee @ $3\/each; 3 quintals of sugar @

Her kids live with her in the home that was very difficult for her to acquire.\r\n\r\nSince she was young, Nelly had a plan to have a bazaar, where she could set up a small shop to help those without money who cannot visit hospitals.  Nelly has a background in pharmacy, and therefore feels responsible to contribute to her town.  And so, she opened her business 6 years ago, which is available to all clients from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., and, seeing as the business is located inside her house, she can serve her clients without neglecting her children.  If this were not the arrangement, Nelly would not be able to enjoy the company of her children, who also help her attend to clients when she needs to leave the house.

He is married to Nicida, age 20, with whom he has a 3-year old daughter. This young family lives in a humble home they own in the central mountains of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nDespite becoming a father at a very young age, Eliel knew he had to improve his life from the moment he saw his daughter because his family was relying on him. That's why for the last 3 years, with the help of his wife, he has planted potatoes, peas, gladiola flower and beans on land given to him by his father and also on leased land, to increase production.\r\n\r\nThe couple is aware that they owe their livelihood to farming because it allows them to furnish their home and maintain an adequate quality of life. Although his daily work requires self-sacrifice, Eliel is happy because he will soon set up a store in town that his wife will attend to while also being able to care for their daughter, who starts school this year.\r\n\r\nBut Eliel also wishes to complete the expansion of his potato processing factory in Lima city, that he has had to leave aside. He will also continue to increase the scale of his farming.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan from MFP and he is certain that he will repay it on time. He enjoys working with the members of his community bank because they are good people that are always quick to support one another. Eliel plans to invest the money he is requesting in the purchase of a bag of seeds for planting peas, organic and chemical fertilizers to speed up crop growth, and insecticide for pest control.

He is 46 years old, married and has three children. His background is agricultural engineering.\n\nMaxime distributes solar lamps in five regions in Mali, including Kayes, Koulikoro, Sikasso, Segou and Mopti. He sells the majority of his solar lamps to poor rural populations such as miners, rice and grain farmers, women who produce cashews, shea butter and pepper, and students. Maxime partners with local cooperatives, teachers, and a network of nuns who live in rural communities to help organize events and raise awareness about the benefits of solar lamps. He also sells through two community associations: Eau Vive Mali and GASE Yeelen, where he serves as president.\n\nMaxime\u2019s customers currently rely on kerosene lamps and flashlights for light. Those that have mobile phones have to walk long distances and pay to charge their phone. They spend about $110 per year on kerosene and mobile phone charging. \n\nHowever, a solar lamp that provides 8 hours of high quality light a night and can charge a mobile phone costs just $25 and has a lifetime of about five years. There are no recurring costs as sunlight powers the lamp for free! \n\nPaying $25 up front for a solar lamp is difficult for Maxime\u2019s customers, though. It is challenging to save that amount of money or to obtain a small, affordable loan.  Most of Maxime's customers earn about $2 a day, which barely covers basic needs like food. Banks only lend to people with a bank account and formal employment contracts, and microfinance institutions only make loans for business activities.\n\nA Kiva loan will allow Maxime to purchase 2,000 solar lamps from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit and then offer credit to his customers. Ultimately, this loan will enable Maxime to improve the livelihoods of about 10,000 people and reduce the negative impact of kerosene on the environment. Families save money on light and mobile phone charging, feel safer at night, are healthier (no toxic smoke from kerosene) and can increase their income because they are able to work at night. Children are also able to study longer. A win-win-win for everyone.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1506291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for solar lamps that he will sell on credit in rural communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bamako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":49900,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maxime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":23950000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":49900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":23950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":992050,"name":"Ma.

In the middle of a residential block, behind large metal doors is the bakery that is the reason for the fragrant aroma. Haydee Flora R. answers the door, and gladly speaks about her successful business, which she has run for more than 18 years. She inherited the operation from her parents when they became too old to manage the operation, and Flora has since expanded and improved the bakery. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has the help of three hardworking employees, and runs a very tight schedule. At 1 o\u2019clock in the morning, the first worker arrives and starts the wood-burning fire that heats the stone oven used to cook the bread. Once the oven is hot enough, he begins the 2 hour process of baking the bread sold in the mornings for breakfast. Next, the workers (who clock 10 hour shifts) bake the other varieties sold throughout the day. The room containing the bread racks and oven is well over 90 degrees, and is saturated with the aroma of fresh baked bread. \r\n<p>\r\nHaydee Flora explains she produces over 20 types of bread, such as sweet breads made with sugar as well as French bread, dinner rolls, and many others. Once the bread has cooled, it is packaged in bags and distributed to small shops all over the city. She allows her employees to eat as much bread as they like, and says she herself has never grown bored of the bread she and her family eat daily. She lives in a home adjacent to the bakery with her husband and three children.

She rents a home from her aunt and wants to make improvements to her business.  With her young children by her side, Beatriz creates her beautiful handcrafted weavings which she sells to a middleman who later sells them in the Tupac Amaru market (an important marketplace in the city of Juliaca).  Beatriz very much enjoys weaving which is why she always makes original weavings even though not all weaving is easy.  Because she finds it difficult to always be weaving \"chullos\" (a typical Andean hat) which are the items which sell best to tourists, she is thinking that it would be best for the future of her business if she were to open her own store where she could sell her weavings herself.  Her wish is to give her children a good education and give them what her parents were not in a position to give her.  This is Beatriz' second loan with MFP, but it is her first as part of her current community bank.  She is prepared to make her repayments on time so that she doesn't hurt her reputation and so as not to create problems for her fellow members.

They became quite successful and soon began selling their meat products in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, where they can charge higher prices than in the countryside.

Esta es la segunda vez que Jorge trabaja con nuestra Instituci\u00f3n y ha demostrado ser un cliente puntual y responsable.\n","en":"Jorge is 53.  He has been separated for 18 years, and he has two children.  He currently lives with his mother and grandmother in the Los Grados sector in the Paij\u00e1n district, Ascope province, La Libertad region.  This is three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in agriculture and with livestock since he was very small.  He raises dairy cows on the fields surrounding his house.  He plants fodder to feed them.  He sells the milk his animals produce to a milk collection company in the area.  This business is the only source of income he has to support his family.\r\n\r\nDue to the passage of time, the walls of his stable, which are made from rustic material, are deteriorating.  That is why Jorge is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 800 PEN.  He plans to buy construction material to improve his stable.\r\n\r\nHis greatest desire is to expand his stable and buy a processor for the fodder.  This is the second time that Jorge has worked with our Institution.  He has demonstrated himself to be a punctual and responsible client.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":450363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy construction materials to improve the stable","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan - Ascope - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T14:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Marciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":190.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":195.09},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":203.81},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":210.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.59},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":71.59,"local_amount":190.9,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":207.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669700},{"amount":73.16,"local_amount":195.09,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":211.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065205},{"amount":76.43,"local_amount":203.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":221.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900303},{"amount":78.82,"local_amount":210.2,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":228.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934459}],"funded_date":"2009-12-17T17:36:09Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":167038,"name":"Hadijah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadijah N. is a hardworking businesswoman.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is especially crucial for women, who are vulnerable but eager and full of enthusiasm to start up their own independent businesses. \r\n\r\nKuku, 66, is the leader of this group. She is a widow and brought up three kids, the youngest of whom is a high school freshman. Her sons live independently in the capital, while Kuku together with her daughter stays in a small fishing town Balykchi, which attracts thousands of tourists both from Kyrgyzstan and abroad. The constant flow of tourists is a key to Kuku\u2019s business success. \r\n\r\nAs she is already retired, all she does is manage her orchard with plenty of fruits and vegetables. This year she was blessed with a very rich harvest of apricot and apples. They do not stay in a warehouse for long and get sold very easily. A monthly profit of 3,700 soms allowed her to purchase new furniture for the house and other necessary things. This year\u2019s savings plus the loan that Kuku is requesting from Kiva lenders will help her finance a trip to her sons in the capital of Bishkek and spend some time with them there. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She lives with her partner Abel and their two children (ages 14 and 13).  Carmen also has a nephew who she is supporting with his education.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is a seamstress and learned this trade from her mother when she was a young girl.  Now this skill provides her a source of income.  Carmen works from home.  In addition to this business, she also buys and sells seeds.  She purchases the seeds from the producers and then ships them outside of the region based on her orders.  Carmen has been providing sewing services for 10 years, while she has been selling seeds for one year.  What she likes about these activities is being able to generate income to pay for expenses.  In addition, these businesses provide her with the opportunity to know and build relationships with more people.  She says that she has enjoyed sewing since she was a young girl because she considers it to be profitable.  This job requires that she produce quality work and she has loyal customers who are always requesting her services.  Her plans include expanding and improving her business by purchasing a semi-industrial sewing machine.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her seventh loan with MFP.  Carmen feels comfortable working with her Communal Bank because she considers the members to be good people who are both punctual and supportive.  The amount she requested will be invested entirely in the purchase of seeds in large quantities so that she can generate more income.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":914014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds in large quantities to sell.

Her husband is a driver for a company, and he earns a salary of $110 per month. \r\n\r\nC. Molina is requesting a loan of $800 to use to purchase more clothing to sell. She is excited about the idea of being able to expand her business. In the future she would like to be able to buy a shop to sell her clothing in, and once her income is large enough she would like to build a home for her family. She believes that this loan will help her to improve her business, increase her family\\'s standard of living, and move her closer to fulfilling her dreams. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":8406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase clothing to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Meanchay District","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2006-12-20T19:39:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Molina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-01-04T06:37:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-01-12T08:52:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":4157},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-02-20T08:34:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7526},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-03-20T08:46:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10379},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-05-04T07:51:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15063},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-06-26T09:15:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26100},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T09:15:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35429},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-08-26T09:15:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":46361},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T09:15:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58655},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T09:15:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71967},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T10:15:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86709},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-12-26T10:15:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-27T06:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":102797}],"funded_date":"2006-12-21T06:37:30Z","paid_date":"2007-12-26T10:15:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":7001,"name":"Reyna Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"For some years now, I have dedicated myself to the making and selling of shirts.

Two study in primary school and one at the secondary level.  For the past six years he has dedicated himself to the jewelry profession, making rings, earrings, gold chains, as well as repairing these same products.  Currently he has a large quantity of requests for graduation rings but due to lack of money he cannot buy the stones and gold needed to make them.  This demand for rings is because in the months of November and December many High School graduations occur and as a remembrance students buy rings with engravings alluding to their respective schools.  In order to facilitate the purchase of his products, Mr. C. allows customers to pay for the rings in four or five installments, since for many parents it is difficult to pay the total cost of these rings all at one time.  Micro-entrepreneur C. employs one other person who he pays a head of the household (full-time) salary. The cost of the square stones used for rings is $2.00 U.S. each, the stones for graduation rings are valued at $3.00 US, a pound of plaster costs $2.00 US, and a gram of gold can be purchased for $8.00.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEl microempresario Rogerio Mart\u00edn C. tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en la ciudad de Bluefields, es casado y tiene 3 hijos, dos estudian en primaria y uno en nivel secundario. Desde hace 6 a\u00f1os se dedica a la profesi\u00f3n de joyero fabricando anillos, aretes, cadenas de oro, as\u00ed como la reparaci\u00f3n de estos mismos productos. Actualmente tiene una gran cantidad de pedidos de anillos de promoci\u00f3n pero por falta de dinero no puede comprar las piedras y el oro para su elaboraci\u00f3n. Esta demanda de anillos se debe a que en los meses de noviembre y diciembre se realizan las graduaciones del nivel secundario y como recuerdo los estudiantes compran anillos con grabaciones alusivas a sus respectivos colegios. El se\u00f1or C. a fin de dar facilidades en las compras de sus productos les permite pagar los anillos en cuatro o cinco partes valorando que a muchos padres de familia se les dificulta pagar de una sola vez el total de estos anillos. El microempresario C. tiene contratado a una persona por lo que aporta a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo de una cabeza de familia. El valor de las piedras cuadradas para anillos es de US$ 2.00 d\u00f3lares cada una, las piedras para anillos de promoci\u00f3n est\u00e1n valoradas en US$ 3.00 d\u00f3lares cada una, la libra de yeso cuesta US$ 2.00 d\u00f3lares cada libra y el gramo de oro se compra a US$ 8.00 cada gramo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":82189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy 20 square stones for various rings, 20 stones for graduation rings, 10 pounds of plaster, and 20 grams of gold.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bluefields","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 -83.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":76,"posted_date":"2007-11-08T03:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogerio Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-22T06:19:39Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5253.78,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":656.72},{"due_date":"2008-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":656.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":612.94,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T22:45:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":656.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94822},{"amount":35,"local_amount":612.94,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T21:51:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":656.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113378},{"amount":35,"local_amount":612.94,"processed_date":"2008-02-11T22:06:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":656.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":133521},{"amount":35,"local_amount":612.94,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T22:56:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":656.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":155022},{"amount":35,"local_amount":612.94,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T14:36:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":656.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":180122},{"amount":35,"local_amount":612.94,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T23:33:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":656.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208642},{"amount":56,"local_amount":980.71,"processed_date":"2008-05-30T15:45:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223749},{"amount":34,"local_amount":595.43,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T14:51:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-03T09:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":637.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226207}],"funded_date":"2007-11-08T06:19:39Z","paid_date":"2008-06-02T14:51:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":27482,"name":"Faig","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faig Mehraliyev is 44 years old.

All of us have the support of our husbands to provide for our families. Our group has been around for 14 years and we live in San Lorenzo, Valle department.  \r\nOur work is in the sales of tortillas and fresh juice. In our country, the tortilla is an indispensable food that nearly the entire population uses as an accompaniment to every meal.  The sales of fresh juice is  great also, since it is very hot where we live.  In addition, the natural drinks are very healthy and refresh the body, and people prefer them as they are rich in vitamins.  The juices we sell the most are those of Melon, orange juice, lime juice, and Watermelon juice.\r\nRight now, all of the products have suffered a rise in prices and everything is more expensive. As a result, we need a loan in order to be able to inject capital into our business and continue to meet the demand of our clients, who are many since we sell our goods in the municipal market of San Lorenzo.  We need your help to accomplish our goals.\r\nTranslated from Spanish to English by Laura Jung, Kiva Volunteer\r\n\r\nhola nuestro grupo Nuevo Amanecer esta conformado por 2 socias mas, en total somos

She is married and has two children, ages 10 and 5. In 2007, she established her coral carving business. Working seven days a week and seven hours a day, she supports her family. This is her first loan from Patan BPW, which she has used to increase her inventory of coral. In the future, Lalita plans to expand the business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn Nepal, large supermarkets are rare. Instead, most items can be found in the small, densely packed pasals that line the streets of every city and village. Piled high with utensils, paper goods, and anything else one would need, these stores are your one-stop shop in Nepal. Although usually packed into a space no larger than 100 square feet, these stores carry a sizeable and diverse inventory. With the help of a Kiva loan, pasal owners are able to keep inventory up and their customers happy. Competition is fierce, but with extra capital and a bit of creativity, the opportunity for profit is there.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and buying and selling bananas. Her husband Aquilino, who is 43 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 14 and 23 years old.\r\n\r\nDelina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
