Ulugbek is 33 years old, and married with three children. He is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of livestock at the local market. Every year, Ulugbek buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Now Ulugbek is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest in a loan of 4000 TJS for his business. In order to receive this amount, Ulugbek has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the store inventory.  In the future, Radha plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower

He lives in the village of Koshelovo and owns a store called \"ABC\" located near the main road. \r\nSome time ago,Yaroslav's wife bought a house and restructured in for a business. Abut one year ago, Yaroslav opened his shop. Despite having a fledgling business, he has already achieved a great reputation among the townspeople and boasts regular customers. \r\nYaroslav needs a loan of 15,000 grivnas in order to stock up on goods before the holidays. In advance of Christmas and New Year's Eve, Ukrainians begin to spend lavishly on grocieries, therefore Yaroslav wants to be ready to meet increased demand for sweets, meat products, etc. \r\nYaroslav is full of ideas on how to expand his business. Because his store is spacious and has a separate entrance, he could rent out part of his building or, possibly, open something himself when his business allows it. One idea consists of opening a veterinary clinic, whose services would be in great demand since animal breeding is a common way to make a living for many people in that part of the country.

She settled in Kampala.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHarriet is a lady with a passion to work hard for survival and sustenance. She has been a member of Life in Africa since 2006, and she is very active in the center. She is a supportive and responsible person who is also good at planning activities. Over time, she has developed the skill to face challenges and overcome them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBefore Harriet joined Life in Africa, life was not easy in terms of general welfare. In her efforts to sustain herself, she searched for work. The work she discovered was with the stone quarry, where she did the stone digging and cracking. She was paid for the work she did. After some time of working at the stone quarry and witnessing others' success, Harriet got the idea to start her own stone quarry business. The stone-selling business is doing very well because of the massive developments of construction taking place.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe stone quarry business involves digging stones, cracking them into the desired sizes depending on the client's order, and delivering the cracked stones to the customers. Currently, Harriet has been producing two deliveries of stones supplied, getting a monthly profit of 90,000 Uganda shillings (UGX). (1USD = 1,722 UGX). She has been making two deliveries only due to limited capital. In order to be able to expand her business, she decided to ask for the loan. She expects to get an 45,000 UGX per delivery of stones made on a monthly basis.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo be able to succeed in this business, Harriet is planning to employ people to do the work as it is

One of her children lives at home.  For more than 35 years she has ran a bakery, which is more than enough time to gain necessary experience for this job.  She and her husband get up at 2:00 am to knead 12 kilos of flour.  While the oven is being heated by firewood, she separates the dough into pieces, then bakes the loaves of bread.  Because of the high price of flour, her business has not been very profitable lately.  She wants to buy a kneading machine so she can make more bread.  When making bread by hand, she uses more flour, which weighs more, but the customers do not pay more.  With a kneading machine she can make more bread with the same amount of flour.  She can also make cakes and other baked items on the weekends.  During the first few days in November her sales triple due to a holiday where she makes and sells a typical sweet bread called \u201chuahuas.\u201d  This is her 3rd loan with MFP and  Luzmila has always been on time with her payments\u2014she has never procrastinated on making a payment.  The money will be used for a kneading machine that she really needs.  She will buy a used one since she can not afford a new one.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, Lyna is borrowing PHP 18,000 which she intends to use to expand her fish and dried fish businesses so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children.\r\n\r\nLyna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":563339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She is married and has one child, aged 6.  In 2003, she established her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the store inventory.  In the future, Nitu plans to send her children to a good school.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates.

Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: general store and buying & selling charcoal businesses.  Her husband Danilo, who is 32 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 2 to 11 years old. \r\n\r\nAmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, with which she intends to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Amelita S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live in large traditional extended families with their children, husbands, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc. They have an average age of 34 and at least 5 children.  They grow mainly rice, and they grown peanuts as a secondary business.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their farms profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program five years ago.  After having correctly repaid the first four loans, they are now on their fifth farm loan.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts; some minor supplies and equipment; and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Fonfona, M\u2019pessoba, and Zansoni.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.  Then the crops are sold retail and wholesale in cash transactions at the M\u2019pessoba market and at surrounding markets.  Their customers come generally from large cities.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":330629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou Bourama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Yafon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Bourama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou Harouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Mamori  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":706153.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152143}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T19:53:48Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117637,"name":"Tamtaneh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here are Amed K., Bakarr K. and Mabinty Koroma of the Tamtaneh group.

Her son is married and her 17-year old daughter administers the business, a local store and small clothing shop. It took Idalia a lot of work to set up the store, using her savings from her work. She works as a cashier to maintain her business when sales are low. \r\n\r\nBy the grace of God she has been able to invest in many products her customers need. She offers store credit, but only to select customers because many people don't pay and she has to approve who she gives credit to. With this loan she wants to buy staple grains, canned milk, cleaning products, and various clothing for women and children, as well as cosmetics to attract new customers and to offer a variety of products to shoppers. \r\n\r\nShe has achieved all this with the support of the institution, AFODENIC. Thanks to this financing and her work, Idalia has been able to advance her business and her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":450473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of rice, beans, sugar, oil, canned milk, cleaning products, and clothing for women and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T18:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idalia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841507},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874430},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604309},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639773},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821556},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561563},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770498},{"amount":250,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5198.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204392}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T21:46:06Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":167074,"name":"Kofi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kofi (which means \"Friday born\") is 56 years old, married and the father of six children.

One of her dreams is to see her children become professionals and to buy herself a little car so that she can transport her groceries from the market to her store.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust placed in her by granting the loan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":487146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":36.25,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936185},{"amount":45.16,"local_amount":45.16,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663729},{"amount":47.04,"local_amount":47.04,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":47.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696535},{"amount":48.12,"local_amount":48.12,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":48.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879586},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":49.99,"processed_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":49.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159619660},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":51.26,"processed_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834123},{"amount":52.9,"local_amount":52.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100696},{"amount":54.77,"local_amount":54.77,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":54.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393534},{"amount":56.36,"local_amount":56.36,"processed_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":56.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182531976},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":58.15,"processed_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":58.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668592}],"funded_date":"2010-03-14T05:03:34Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":179740,"name":"Charlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charlita T. is from the village of  Kadingilan, Bukidnon.

He is 46 years old and lives with his wife, Irma. Raul works as a construction worker in the village, when there are orders. Also, he is involved in the family agricultural business. They have two milk cows and three calves, and produce and sell 35 kg of cheese per month at a local open market. Also, Raul and Irma have a pig and sell 12-16 piglets per year. Along with the above, Raul grows bamboo trees on a family-owned 0.5 hectare plot. He sells 500-600 bamboo poles per year, which are used for furniture production. The average total monthly income of the family is 550 laris. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Raul plans to purchase a car.

She plans to use the next loan of US $750 to purchase more coal stock."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":39311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase bulk charcoal stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":24,"posted_date":"2007-06-04T04:12:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-18T19:33:18Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:16:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33290},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:17:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43999},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:16:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55979},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:17:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68925},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:17:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83044},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T10:17:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98740},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-01-18T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117508},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137524},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-03-18T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160349},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-04-18T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185303},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-05-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212990},{"amount":57,"local_amount":57,"processed_date":"2008-06-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-18T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":241217}],"funded_date":"2007-06-04T19:33:18Z","paid_date":"2008-06-18T09:02:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":15229,"name":"Tahire","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tahire G. has a beauty salon in the town of Devechi, which is located on the northeastern coast of Azerbaijan.

M. has owned the Josephine Mini Shop for the past twenty years. When she was asked who Josephine is, she smiled and said that was her first-born daughter. Mary is married with two children, and she also cares for 2 orphans. Mary sells sugar, soap, cooking oil, and salt, along with personal hygiene items, at the mini shop in her village of Kikajjo on the outskirts of Kampala. Many of the retail stores sell very similar products. There are at least two reasons. First, the needs of people with little means are not varied; they are buying essentials, not luxuries. And second, one does not want to take a risk and fail at a business, as there is no safety net. So, you stock what you know will sell.

has sufficient experience and is a scholar at his trade. He has been in the animal husbandry business for the past six years. His family helps him take care of the livestock. The cow house is located on a wide farm-yard near his house. <p>\r\nHis current business is very stable and has a good capital turnover. His business consists of buying, feeding and growing and then selling of cattle. The profits grow more with each month and he uses part of the profits to support his family and the rest to reinvest into his business to buy fodder for the cattle. As you can see on the photo, the cow house is a bit small and Akmal wants to build a new one. In the future, he wants to increase the number of livestock, but there's a small problem with the premises. A credit counselor advised him to apply for a loan with Kiva.

As a young man in his native Chanchamayo (in the jungle, in the department of Huancayo), he began a motorcycle taxi service. He then moved to Lima where he earned more money as he joined a group of motorcycle taxi drivers, allowing him to get more regular work. He really likes his work and he does it with pleasure even though he has very big plans for the future. He also trained to be a mechanic, work which he has always enjoyed. He wants to open his own workshop while renting out the motorcycle taxi which he currently drives.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll work requires sacrifice,\u201d says Roberto, but he knows that after much effort and hard work he will achieve a better future for his family.\r\n\r\nThis is his second individual loan with Kiva partner MFP. He has always been very punctual with his repayments, and he is very happy to continue working with this institution. With the money he plans to buy an engine and repair his motorcycle.

Mrs. Thavy M. is a village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns 0,6-hectar to cultivate rice for a living. In this farming, she now faces a small problem because she does not have enough money to buy more fertilizers to support the field to make her crop more productive. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers for her purpose. Her husband, Mr. Arn Seourn, also helps her in the farming. Mrs. Thavy M. is 27 years old and the mother of a child who is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of four years old. A man who is presented in the photo is a group guarantee; he also shown in the picture with the village bank loan.\n\nTwo members in this village bank loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows tH. to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

They all share their days very happily in their own house.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early age she has worked at various jobs helping her mother, Clara.  Her mother is the one that taught her to be hard-working.  In her youth, her mother was as dynamic as Liliana.  She sold food and was also a business person in order to generate extra income to add to her husband\u2019s salary.  That way she improved the family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nLiliana currently has a more stable business, a mini market.  She works there the whole week from six in the morning until nine at night.  As it is a very tiring job, she must divide herself between her chores at home and her business.  Because she has school aged children, she must prepare their food before sending them to school.\r\n\r\nIn spite of everything, Liliana is very happy.  She can devote herself to them and also to her business.  She plans to keep growing the business to improve her income.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

D. T., 57, lives in the Marchuela area of Usme, a neighborhood on the outskirts of the Colombian capital of Bogota.  She is married and has twelve children who range in age from 12 to 39.  She works with her husband selling hardware, tools, car parts, construction supplies, electrical parts and even inflatable toys.  This is her fourth Fundacion loan and the previous loans have allowed her to increase her working capital, something that she thinks has greatly contributed to her financial situation and her way of living.  She is applying for a 1,200,000-peso loan that she will use to buy tools--saws, screwdrivers, etc.--and more inflatible toys for her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria Nubia is a native of the \"departamento\" of Caldas in the Eje Cafetero region of western Colombia.  She spent twenty years traveling around Colombia with her husband who worked for a carnival, both of them going from place to place, selling fun.  At the beginning of the 1990s, the family settled in Barranquilla where they bought a house and opened a shop.  For the sake of her husband's health, the family resettled in Bogota in 2008 and, happily, his health is now better.  Maria Nubia's goal is to buy a house in the capital because they had to sell their Barranquilla house.  She wants to live in the same neighborhood as the shop because there are lots of businesses nearby, it's convenient and the people are friendly.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere

The loan that he is requesting is to buy 50 cases of Fanta, which he will sell at retail to make a profit and repay his loan.\r\n\r\nThe loan contracted with ACB is his 13th, the interest paid with his business income.  He uses them to pay school fees and increase his sales figures.  In the future, after paying back the loan, he will be able to take out a bigger loan and become a certified distributor for Bralirwa (a large brewer and soft drink company in Rwanda).    \r\n<br

His father was a cook and his mother a teacher. Jossefa studied until the 3rd grade.\r\n\r\nBecause Jossefa lost his parents at a young age, he started working as an assistant painter at the age of 17. He became a painter and worked for the Portuguese, who left Mozambique in 1974. After they left Jossefa used his savings to buy a boat, and started his fishing activities using a fishing rod.\r\n\r\nWith his gains, Joseffa was able to buy fishing nets, and hire 9 workers with whom he worked with until the 2000 flood. Because of the flood Joseffa lost his nets and had to lay off the workers.\r\n<p>\r\nWith government help he returned to fishing, with great difficultym, which led him to borrow from HLUVUKU in order to buy nets. He has taken 4 loans with which he has bought a boat and the engine.\r\nAt this time Jossefa has 2 boats and 2 engines. He rents the second boat to friends. He has hired 6 full time workers and 2 part time helpers. He cares for 12 family members, including his children and grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan of 21.000,00MT Joseffa will buy new fishing nets, and maintain the engine and boats.\r\nJoseffa\u2019s work has a great impact in his community because it creates jobs and provides fish, and other seafood products for the markets of the city of Maputo.\r\nIn the future Joseffa plans on purchasing a bigger boat and more sophisticated nets, which will allow him to increase his income and create more jobs. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Komatsuzaki Fraga, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Guachene - Catembe\r\nActividade: Pesca\r\nValor Financiado: 21.000,00MT (840.00US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do montante: Compra de redes de Pesca \r\n\r\nIn\u00edcio: 09\/05\/2007\r\nFim: 30\/04\/2008\r\n\r\n\r\nJossefa M., nascido em 1950 na Catembe, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, Filho de Pai Cozinheiro e M\u00e3e Professora estudou at\u00e9 3\u00aa Classe.\r\n\r\nPor ter perdido os seus pais cedo, aos dezassete anos come\u00e7ou a trabalhar como ajudante de pintor onde se tornou mestre e trabalhou para patr\u00f5es Portugueses, os quais deixam Mo\u00e7ambique em 1974, facto que levou-o a usar o valor acumulado para compra de um barco, iniciando assim a actividade de pesca por anz\u00f3is.\r\n\r\nCom o rendimento conseguiu comprar redes e contratou 9 trabalhadores com os quais trabalhou at\u00e9  ao per\u00edodo das  cheias de 2000 onde perdeu redes e teve que dispensa-los .\r\n\r\nCom ajuda do governo reactivou a sua actividade mas com ligeiras dificuldades o que\u2013lhe levou a recorreu ao empr\u00e9stimo na HLUVUKU para refor\u00e7ar as redes e reparar o motor do barco.

This makes her access to formal employment almost null. She is married to Lisua Rene. They have 4 children, out of whom 2 live with them still. Irene has a small candy stand. She explains it's difficult to do business in her community because a lot of people sell the same things. She sometimes goes to sell on the streets of nearby communities to sell her merchandise. The other challenge she faces is the size of her community. Batey 18 has only 3 streets. \r\n\r\nIrene would like to continue investing in her business and saving towards a future expansion (hopefully outside of her batey).

Since she was very young she has used a loom to weave blankets and cloaks, and ultimately has found work weaving speciality fabrics for backpacks and purses, like those shown in the photo. For each fabric, she tries to harmonize the colors according to the tastes of her clients. However, thanks to her preferences it doesn't take much time for the fabrics to be sold and this makes her very happy. For the moment, she is a little sad because her feet hurt because of the excessive cold that they absorb while she weaves. Her town is in a zone that is very cold, but she works equally as hard as her husband, and they have therefore been able to put forward the money to be able to offer their children professional studies. This is her ninth loan with MFP, an affiliate of Kiva, and after all this time (4 years), she has come to lead her communal bank as the president of the board of directors. The money that she is requesting now will be invested in the purchase of supplies for her artisan weavings. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":422604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy textiles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T03:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2537.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672656}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T18:21:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lois Parshley","image":null}},{"id":154713,"name":"Beatriz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatriz D. is from the village of Lower Dicayas.

They live inFanny's mother's house, which is located in Paij\u00e1n district, Ascope province, La Libertad region, which is located 3 hours away from the city of Chiclayo.  For the past 15 years she has sold water to residents of isolated communities in the district that lack this basic service. She extracts the water from a well that her grandparetns dug on the property where she lives.  She sells at a reasonable price and people always come to her.  In fact, even when water supplies are cut in her district, neighbors come to her home to request water.  She also earns income by providing cleaning services to some institutions in the area.  During the day, she divides her time between these locations and even some private homes that have requested her services.  These two activities produce her only source of income to support her family.  Fanny has worked with Kiva in the past and she is very grateful to Kiva donors who have supported her.  During the past few months she has been saving money to make one of her dreams come true:  to build her house.  Construction has begun but she needs additional funds to finish the roof on a bedroom.

She earns her living from a pig-fattening business.  She buys piglets when they are small, and then raises them, feeds them, and fattens them for sale when they reach an appropriate size. This is also called piggery, which is also the name for the pen where the pigs are kept. In order to keep a business like Ma. Leah's running, she needs to be constantly buying new piglets and more feed so that the pigs can bring in a high price when she sells them. Project Dungganon helps by providing the capital to make this happen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ma. Leah\u2019s husband, Joseph, has another job to support their family. They have three children ranging from an infant to 15 years old. Two of the children attend school, but they also help their parents with the business as part of their daily chores.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ma. Leah joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 with the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of the loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase her family income, earning an additional Php 8,000 from her business activities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ma. Leah is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 14,000 was used to fund and maintain her pig-fattening business by helping her purchase feed and other supplies. It had a positive impact on both her business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing her 8th loan, in the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use for the same purposes. Ma. Leah D. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About NWTF:<\/p><\/strong><br>\r\n<p>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":476013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional piglets and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T05:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

They live in a home that cost them very much to build and which includes a shop where she manufactures articles of clothing.  She has two helpers and has been doing this for four years.  She also started making wallets of different colors and nice designs.  Doris is very creative.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys doing these things very much, but this does not mean that it is easy work.

His stall is located in the old city. Maher is a husband and father. The food stall is the family's source of income which he wants to expand into a small restaurant offering more local dishes. Maher came to Kiva's partner, FATEN, asking for a loan to purchase basic ingredients for homos such as chickpeas and ginger oil. Maher aims to increase the amount he produces for clients as homos is a very popular local dish.\n\nMaher appears in the photo next to his stall.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

raising four children, the youngest of whom are school students.  Her husband works in the neighboring Kazakhstan at a construction site.  In search of an additional source of income for her family, Cholpon started her business of selling vegetables and fruits in 2006.  Having started with a sum of 10,000 som (KGS), Cholpon was able to develop her business to have a monthly income of about 20,000 som (KGS), thanks to her persistence and hard work.  She buys fruits and produce, such as apples, tomatoes and peppers from local producers at wholesale prices and then sell the produce at a local market.  In order to further grow her business, Cholpon requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand her product selection.  She plans to invest the profits from this loan into an expansion of her retail space."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":932039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to broaden an assortment of products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tokmok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cholpon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4076},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3672},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3776},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3883},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3993},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4106},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4222},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4342},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4465},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4591},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4722},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4152}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.35},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.71},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.52},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.58,"local_amount":7748,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7777.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722529},{"amount":81.19,"local_amount":3776,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3790.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125465},{"amount":83.48,"local_amount":3883,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3897.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250619},{"amount":85.85,"local_amount":3993,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4007.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975589},{"amount":88.28,"local_amount":4106,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4121.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816167},{"amount":90.77,"local_amount":4222,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4237.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072195},{"amount":93.35,"local_amount":4342,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4358.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370764},{"amount":96,"local_amount":4465,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4481.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285431},{"amount":98.71,"local_amount":4591,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4608.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339021},{"amount":190.79,"local_amount":8874,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8907.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095375}],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T22:17:28Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":368506,"name":"Mackline's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mackline's group is comprised of six hard-working women.
