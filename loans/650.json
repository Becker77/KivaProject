Omar wants to purchase more chicks for sale and fodder to feed them. This will expand his project, increase sales and improve his income. He does not have enough money to do this so he needs a loan from FATEN. When Omar gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase more chicks and fodder. In this way, his sales will increase and he will improve his income and living conditions. Omar is photographed in his project.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her pigpen is very simple with bamboo wall and cement floor. Everyday she cleans the pigpen, and then feeds the pigs with food mixtures such as rice chaff, tofu concentrate and dregs. The food cost her Rp. 1,000,000 (about $110). The revenue from selling the pigs were Rp. 2,000,000 (about $221) so the net income was Rp. 500,000 (about $55).

Modal yang didapatnya diperoleh dari Dinari . Dari modal ini Ni Nyoman Noli  membeli 2 ekor babi penggemukan dengan harga satu ekor Rp.250.000,- jadi 2 babi harganya Rp.500.000,-. Sisa dari pembelian bibit dipakai untuk modal pakan selama 6 bulan. Kondisi kandang babi Nyoman Noli sederhana, dinding dari bambu dan lantai semen. Setiap hari Ni Nyoman Noli rajin membersihkan kandangnya, setelah itu baru babinya diberi makan dengan campuran makanannya seperti dedak padi, konsentrat dan ampas tahu. Sampai babi siap dipanen, menghabiskan biaya pakan sebesar Rp.1.000.000,-. Sedangkan pendapatan kotornya Rp.2.000.000,- jadi pendapatan bersihnya Rp.500.000,-.

She purchases cocoa from farmers and then resell it to wholesalers.  She needs additional capital to be able to compete with other traders.  She had obtained a loan from DINARI in the past that helped her business grow.  Currently she earns about $3.5 to $4.5 per day.  However, this profit is not sufficient to grow the business satisfactorily for W., as she needed to pay for daily expenses too.  Furthermore, Cocoa prices has been increasing dramatically.  She used to purchase Cocoa for $1.1 to $1.3 per kg, now she purchases cacaos at $2.2 per kg.  So she intends to increase her working capital to be able to compete with larger traders.

Sebagai seorang pedagang yang  membeli kakao dari petani dan kemudian dijual lagi ke pembeli besar,   membutuhkan modal yang lebih untuk bisa bersaing dengan  pedagang lain.

Namun keuntungan ini belum bisa meningkatkan modal yang di miliki oleh W. karena selain digunakan untuk biaya kebutuhan sehari-hari, W. juga harus bisa mengatur keuntungan ini untuk modal lagi. Hal ini disebabkan oleh karena pengaruh kenaikan harga barang yang begitu drastis. Kakao yang dulunya di beli dengan harga Rp.  10.000.- s\/d Rp. 12.000.- \/ kilo kini melonjak mencapai Rp. 20.000.- \/ kilonya. Dengan demikian W. bermaksud untuk menambah kembali jumlah pinjamannya sehingga masih bisa bersaing dengan pedagang yang lain.\r\nDengan tambahan modal ini W. berharap bisa membeli barang lebih banyak khususnya semua kakao petani yang sudah menjadi langganannya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":189735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase trading capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-15T10:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-29T14:55:13Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":412692.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334324},{"amount":90,"local_amount":800000,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T08:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":825385.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308524},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":412692.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925450},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":412692.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849747}],"funded_date":"2008-08-15T14:55:13Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:02:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":63979,"name":"Amina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amina  is 40  years old.

For four years, she has been engaging in these business activities and is doing well because the 200 chickens that she takes with her to sell go very fast at a good price (20 Peruvian Nuevos Soles each). She likes her job very much because she knows many riverside places and it is profitable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRubylyn dreams to be able to give all her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance

In the future, Bindu plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70 percent of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater quantities of seeds and fertilizer. With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.

","en":"Bahri has been working as an on-duty dispatcher at a medical emergency service for 15 years.  She has three sons, and her husband passed away eight years ago.  She married off two of her youngest sons and purchased them an apartment.  Currently, her sons are in Russia, and one of them left with his wife, but left the children for Bahri to support.  Bahri is raising her school-age grandchildren by herself, buys them food, clothing and other things.  Sometimes, their father sends back money.  Bahri's other son also left and left his wife, who is a homemaker, and Bahri also gives her money for food and clothing.  Currently, they need to purchase a washing machine because, having bought the appliance, her daughter-in-law would have more time for the children and other household work.  Bahri's sons promised to send money to their mother to buy a new television for the New Year's holiday.  She, however, does not rely on money sent by her sons and plans to make the purchases on her own.  Bahri does not want to depend on her sons because she thinks that since each son has his own family, they should provide for their families, and she can use her own efforts to support her needs because she earns a salary and a pension."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":939503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer

She started this business because her husband\u2019s income as a farmer was insufficient to meet their household needs, particularly now that both their kids were in school. With an initial capital of $100, Ni Nyoman Noriani built her business. She sources her materials from a local market. Since she has been doing this for a while, she has a particular store where she buys her inventory. With a small capital, she obviously yields a small profit, which is just enough to provide food for her family. Ni Nyoman Noriani requested a loan through DINARI Foundation to increase her capital. With this loan, she can buy Kamen and worship means in bigger quantities and wider selections so that her customers will have more items to choose from. She hopes that this business expansion can yield a higher profit, which can support their household needs and her children\u2019s education plans. Ni Nyoman Noriani is very grateful for the loan given through DINARI.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTinggal dilingkungan yang penduduknya sebagian besar beragama Hindu membuat Ni Nyoman Noriani mempunyai peluang untuk membuka usaha berjualan Kamen ( pakaian adat Bali ) dan berbagai sarana keperluan sembahyang untuk umat Hindu. Hal ini dilakukan karena penghasilan suaminya sebagai seorang petani tidak mencukupi untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga. Apalagi sekarang kedua anaknya sudah duduk dibangku sekolah. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1000.000.- Ni Nyoman Noriani membangun usahanya ini. Barang dagangan ia beli di pasar yang ada di kotanya, karena pembelanjaan dilakukan secara rutin maka sekarang Ni Nyoman Noriani sudah mempunyai langganan tetap untuk pembelian barang dagangan tersebut. Dengan modal yang sedikit tentulah keuntungan yang diperoleh pun sedikit, dan itu hanya cukup untuk kebutuhan dapur saja. Oleh sebab itu Ni Nyoman Noriani mengajukan pinjaman modal ke Yayasan Dinari ,untuk menambah modal usahanya. Dengan modal tersebut sekarang Ni Nyoman Noriani bisa membeli Kamen dan juga perlengkapan sembahyang dengan jenis yang lebih banyak lagi ,sehingga pembeli bisa memilih sesuai dengan selera mereka. Pengembangan usaha ini diharapkan dapat memberi keuntungan yang lebih banyak ,sehingga kebutuhan keluarga dapat tercukupi dan anak-anak bisa bersekolah kejenjang yang lebih tinggi. Ni Nyoman Noriani sangat berterimakasih atas pinjaman modal yang diberikan oleh Dinari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":136533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious

And then they are sold at the same marketplace and at surrounding marketplaces at the retail level (often wholesale), in cash transactions, to customers generally from large cities.\r\n\r\nThe group members each intend to realize, after selling their produce, an average profit of 45,000 francs CFA, which will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":329690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adele","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antoinnete   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mafoun\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monique ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jandarque ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"B\u00e9atrice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natalie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":375000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":381887.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152129}],"funded_date":"2009-07-06T22:23:41Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117261,"name":"Morng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Morng S., 29, pictured with her husband, is married and resides with him in Prey Veng province.

Clarita is the leader of an ASKI loan group consisting of five members. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Salucong.\r\n\r\n<p>Clarita is married and has three school-aged children. She has run a general store for over five years earning approximately 3,000 PHP a month as her sole income.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, Clarita joined ASKI to access their financial services and to improve both her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clarita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Clarita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her sixth ASKI loan. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About ASKI:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":439105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

A fast learner, he quickly began to notice all the possibilities for this type of service in Massachusetts and in 2005 started working for himself. His most difficult challenge was the language. <P>\r\n\r\n\"I was not fluent in English, and I still am not yet, but it was much worse in the beginning. I had to pay someone to translate everything for me. I overcame this language barrier because my clients saw the perfection of my work and they were very happy with it.\"<P>\r\n\r\n\"This is my 4th loan with AUSA. I used my 2 first loans to start building my credit in the US and the 2 most recent loans I used to purchase new equipment for my business. I used credit cards to purchase supplies, but I try to pay the full balance every month to avoid paying the high interest they charge. I read about ACCION USA in a local Brazilian paper. For now I am just focused on expanding my business, but I wish to save and buy a house for my retirement.\"\t<P>\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<P>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and proviD. employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":448503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Equipment

This is an average family from Istaravshan, Tajikistan. However, Mahbuba is a unique entrepreneur. She has been selling fabric for national dresses in the central city market for about 11 years, running her own small venture successfully. The secret of her success is simple: not only does she tell her customers the benefits of her products, but she also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop where she is with her venture. Mahbuba is seeking a loan of $1000 USD to re-stock the merchandise in her store. We believe that Mahbuba\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing her customers will ensure her further success and encourage new customers to buy from her. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 41 years old. Zenie is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nZenie is married and has three children; one is an adult and two are school-aged. To make a living, Zenie owns and operates a motorcycle-transport business. Zenie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Zenie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zenie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for personal purposes. \r\n\r\nZenie is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase motorcycle spare parts. This will be the 10th loan taken out by Zenie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":587202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is 36 years old. May is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, May owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. May has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, May joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. May has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. May is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by May from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nevertheless, after a few minutes of questioning they began to show their personalities and entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\r\n<P>Many of the women have dedicated themselves to weaving traditional clothing of the region or working as housekeepers from their homes.  However, little by little they soon discovered an untapped market for nutritional foods at different levels in the local economy.  It is because of this vision and enterprising drive that Friendship Bridge has decided to support them with a loan, with help from Kiva.  The average loan requested by each woman is of Q200 (Guatemalen Quetzales) or $264 USD.  This means that these women are willing to invest a considerable amount for the improvement of their business.\r\n\r\n<P>The women will use the loan for varioU. activities.  Many of them will use the loan to purchase fertilizer, seeds and cultivating tools in order to plant and harvest vegetables and sell them in the local market.  The loan will also be used to purchase fruit and vegetables in bulk and resell them in the local market.  The women will also purchase maize in bulk in order to prepare tortillas for later sale.  Other women will purchase chickens and pigs to help grow their business of raising animals.\r\n\r\n<P>The dreams of these women go hand-in-hand with the wellbeing of their children.  These women would like to receive this loan so that they can invest in their business.  The money earned will allow them to purchase better clothes for their children, fix and enlarge their homes so that their children can live comfortably, and to pay for their children\u2019s schooling.  This will allow their children to enjoy a better future.  Finally, the dream of one woman was the other women would be in God\u2019s graces helping them pay on time and allowing the group to become a solid group of colleagues and friends. Friendship Bridge will do what is required to monitor and distribute the loan funds, will allocate the appropriate loan amount to each borrower and will establish guidelines for this to take place. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Christian Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras que constituyen la ComUnidad o banco comunal \u201cEl Mirador\u201d son unas mujeres que al comienzo reflejaban una mirada temerosa.

Pero, poco a poco fueron descubriendo un mercado virgen para la venta de productos alimenticios en distintos niveles de la econom\u00eda local. Es por esa visi\u00f3n y empuje empresarial que Friendship Bridge ha decidido apoyarlas con un cr\u00e9dito, por medio de los prestamistas de Kiva. El promedio  del primer cr\u00e9dito solicitado por cada se\u00f1ora es de Q2000 o U.$264.

Tambi\u00e9n, el pr\u00e9stamo se va a utilizar para comprar frutas y verduras al por mayor y revenderlas en el mercado local. Asimismo, ellas van a comprar ma\u00edz al por mayor para prepara tortillas y luego venderlas. Otras se\u00f1oras van a comprar pollos y cerdos para agrandar su negocio de crianza de animales. \r\n\r\n<P>Los sue\u00f1os de estas se\u00f1oras van de la mano con el bienestar de sU. hijos.

De esa manera sU. hijos puedan disfrutar de un mejor futuro. Finalmente, el sue\u00f1o que una se\u00f1ora tuvo fue que el resto de sU. compa\u00f1eras est\u00e9n en la gracia de Dios para que todas puedan pagar a tiempo y de esa manera construir un grupo s\u00f3lido de socias y amigas.

She makes a living by selling livestock, which she raises in her home and then sells in various markets in the city. Julia likes her job and always has liked animals, which she raises with much affection and dedication. Due to the difficulty of her job, her son helps her transport the livestock to the markets, which requires a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nOn the days she sells the livestock, Julia wakes up at 6:00 a.m. to travel with the livestock to the street markets and returns in the evening hours, exhausted from the labor of the trip. Julia wants her son Nelson to be a good man and wants to accustom him to the job so that he doesn\u2019t go down the wrong path because in her eyes, he is being corrupted by his young friends. With this loan, she will buy more livestock in order make her business more productive. In the future, Julia would like to have a similar business that her son could operate. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":219567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Increase the amount of livestock that she raises and sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-09T20:30:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-23T22:09:35Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957525},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227775},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423008},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116236},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011193},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":90.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594796}],"funded_date":"2008-11-09T22:09:35Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":76317,"name":"Marco Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Marco Antonio V. vive en la Localidad de El Torno desde hace 5 a\u00f1os aproximadamente, vive en casa propia junto a su esposa y sus tres hijos peque\u00f1os, actualmente se dedica al negocio del internet, siendo propietario de un cibercaf\u00e9 y un punto de llamadas.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At 45 years of age, with two children who are 21 and 22 years old, Devy lives in the village of Brgy. Tuig, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nMany years ago, Devy wanted to help her husband pay for their family expenses, so she put up a general store and it lessened the financial burden on her husband. As her store grew, she needed additional capital to sustain its growth \u2013 this is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003. It enabled her to expand her store operations even more. When her husband died, she was so grief-stricken even her business was affected for some time, but then she realized that she still had her children to support and to live for, so she focused all of her attention in this new direction and moved on with her life and her business. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause of her invigorated efforts, her business began to grow again and with the help of loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she now earns a minimum of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month. She saves most of her income for the security and future of her children after spending for household expenses. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP was used as additional working capital for her general store. Now that it is fully repaid, she is applying for a new loan, borrowing the same amount of 18,000 PHP for her eighth loan cycle which she intends to use in her general store as additional working capital to buy more products to sell.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i>(a Hiligaynon word that means <u>Honorable<\/u>).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general  alteration & tailoring services and making curtains & basketball uniforms for local community members. Violeta has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Violeta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Violeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Violeta is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional tailoring materials such as needles & thread. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Violeta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in the community of Triboline, an outlying part of the city of Sivia, where they have their own house built from simple materials. Lucila works in agriculture, specifically as a producer and seller of fruits such as pineapples, mangos, pacay [\"ice-cream beans\"], bananas and citrus fruits. She has been doing this work for 20 years. She recalls that when she had her first plot of land, she began to work toward her personal dream, since she had great faith, and because of this she succeeded. As soon as her first crops were ready, she sold them at the marketplace in her town, but she also sometimes went to the markets of other towns, and thus she became known among her customers. Now, she takes everything she produces to the city of Ayacucho, so that she can sell it wholesale. In this way, she is able to earn a good income, allowing her to pay the costs for educating her children. In general, she works independently, but at harvest time she needs help from laborers who take on the work of collecting the fruits. With the help of the loan, she will be able to buy fertilizers to improve the quality of her fields and later harvest high-quality fruits. Her plan for the future is to rebuild her house using solid materials, because she needs to provide security and comfort for her family. This will be her 13th loan, and she is very happy to know that she will have support from all of you. In this way, she feels secure in buying what she requested, and she is ready to make her scheduled payments on time. With the 1,700 Peruvian new soles, she will buy natural fertilizers to improve the soil on her piece of land. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":817866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy natural fertilizers.

He attended school until the 7th grade and was recruited to obligatory military service. He transfered to the city of Maputo where he continued his studies until the third year of Comercial school and obtained a house. In 2000 he sold his house and moved to the Bagamoyo village where he resides until this day. With the money from the sale of his house, he built another house and developed his water business. The architect's miscalculations of the structure caused the water tanks to collapse, and Albino lost his investment. Still, he continued with his project, and with the help of some friends, he was able to purchase a new water tank. He also came to know Hluvuku and asked him for a loan, increasing the number of tanks to two. With his second loan he purchased a pump with greater capacity and increased the number of tanks by one, subsequently increasing the number of customers. With the current loan of 1,200 dollars he intends to purchase more tanks and tubes.<p> He services 91 clients with fixed contracts, and another 300 people benefit from his business. He hopes to invest in other villages where the community suffers from diverse sicknesses due to a lack of natural water. This business helps him support the six people who are his responsibility.

Em 2000 vendeu a casa e mudou-se para o Bairro de Bagamoyo onde reside at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o. Com o dinheiro da venda de casa construiu outra e com o valor remanescente dicidiu abrir um furo de \u00e1gua para fazer face a escassez de \u00e1gua pot\u00e1vel que se atravessa naquele bairro. O mau c\u00e1lculo da estrutura por parte do t\u00e9cnico causou o desabamento dos tanques e perda do investimento aplicado.

Alex is married and has one son who is 10 years-old and goes to school at the local public school.

He worked for out of his home for a while but decided to stop because it did not pay enough. With his savings he bought a car and uses it as a taxi service.

Now she earns an average monthly income of 12,000 Philippine pesos from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPrincess N. is a member in good standing of NWTF-Project Dungganon, a Kiva partner. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her food-vending business. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is borrowing for her 17th loan the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use for her food-vending business. Princess N. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

Nancy is trying to change her life for the better.  She and her husband plant twice a year: broad beans, potatoes and peas, products that she sells in Tarma\u2019s wholesale market because profits are highest there.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is to keep her crops pest-free.  She has been in this line of work for 7 years and considers the most difficult part of it to be transporting her product to market because the sacks are very heavy.  She is hoping to improve production to obtain better prices.\r\n\r\nThis is her 4th loan with MFP and she assures us that this funding will be very helpful for her to grow as a farmer.

It's located in the entrance of the city of Carpegu\u00e1. Thanks to her small business and the credits she obtained, she was able to keep progressing and with her earnings she manages to pay for the studies of her only daughter -who is her greatest hope. She is hoping she can finish her studies and have a worthy profession which improves her quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nHer tenacious spirit and her wishes to accomplish her goals, have been the motivation to start her workdays at 4 am, when she goes up to the municipal market which is 40 minutes away from her home to buy the products she later sells. Her neighbours admire her for her sacrifice and her clients are very content with since her products are good and the service she gives them is the best.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause the home where they live is precarious, Obdulia needs to make a few repairs since the roof and the floor are in deplorable state and urgent repair is necessary.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":126479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They are one of the oldest most accomplished communal banks the organization has, and the members are very proud of that fact. They definitely feel a strong affection for the organization and vice versa. The group meets every 42 days in the house of Adela R. to get their training, repay their debts or deposit their savings. There is a happy and responsible ambiance in Adela's home, due to the fact that all the members of an accomplished history. <p>\r\nWhat they most like about working under a communal bank system is that, thanks to being a group of women with a good record, they are assured access to loans and avoid any red tape. They also enjoy sharing experiences with each other. With respect to The Friendship Bridge, they group feels its a good institution that is trustworthy, gives out loans quickly and has good customer service. They are also satisfied with the training they receive, among the courses the group highlights as especially helpful are business administration, medicinal plants, women's health and family planning, which is particularly stressed because it can have such an impact on their lives. Keep in mind that in rural areas families can become very large and as a consequence it can result in the families falling further into poverty. <p>\r\nSantiago de Atitlan is a place known for the ability of its artisans. The most beautiful bead-based jewelry in the region comes from there. By luck, this group has two members who work in this trade. They will invest their loans in the purchase of beads to make necklaces, bracelets and earrings. Two of the women work in textiles, weaving tradition blouses called \"huipiles\", while another member embroiders these items with beautiful birds, roses or Mayan symbols. Adela, a woman of strong character and playful at the same time like many women on the Guatemalan coast, sells snacks and American clothing. Finally, Karla R. has a cosmetics business. She buys her items via catalogue and sells them door to door.\r\n\"The Stars of Atitlan\" is a group that empowers all of its members. The members a group that has congealed over time and that works very well together. Due to this, it's imperative that The Friendship Bridge and Kiva members work together to support this group of talented, hard-working women.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las Estrellas de Atitlan han venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por muchos a\u00f1os. Son uno de los bancos comunales m\u00e1s antiguos y m\u00e1s cumplidos que tiene la instituci\u00f3n y ellas se sienten muy orgullosas de eso. Ellas definitivamente sienten una afiliaci\u00f3n fuerte con la instituci\u00f3n y viceversa. Las Estrellas se juntan cada 42 d\u00edas en la casa de do\u00f1a Adela R. R. para recibir sus capacitaciones y repagar su deuda o depositar su ahorro. En la casa de Adela hay un ambiente de alegr\u00eda y de responsabilidad. Esto se debe a que todas las mujeres tienen una tradici\u00f3n de ser cumplidas. \r\n\r\n<P>Lo que m\u00e1s les gusta de trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales es que debido a que tienen un grupo de mujeres cumplidas ellas se aseguran el acceso a cr\u00e9dito y se evitan el gran problema de la mora. Asimismo, les gusta compartir experiencias de la vida entre ellas. Con respecto a Friendship Bridge, ellas sienten que es una buena instituci\u00f3n debido a que es confiable, entrega el cr\u00e9dito r\u00e1pido y tiene buen servicio al cliente gracias a la labor de la compa\u00f1era Maria Q.. De la misma manera, ellas se sienten contentas porque reciben capacitaciones. Las mujeres contaron que las capacitaciones que m\u00e1s le gustaron fueron las de administraci\u00f3n del negocio, plantas medicinales, salud de la mujer y planificaci\u00f3n familiar. Las clientes hicieron hincapi\u00e9 en la charla de planificaci\u00f3n ya que si les creo un impacto en sus vidas. Vale recordar, que en las \u00e1reas rurales las familias pueden llegar a ser muy extensas y como consecuencia esto puede resultar en que a las familias le cueste salir m\u00e1s de la pobreza. \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago de Atitlan es un lugar reconocido por la capacidad de sus artesanas. En este lugar se produce una de las joyas, en base a mostacilla, m\u00e1s bellas de la regi\u00f3n. Por suerte, en este grupo tenemos dos clientas que trabajan en ese rubro. Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en comprar bolitas de mostacilla para elaborar collares, brazaletes y aretes. Dos se\u00f1oras trabajan con tejidos. Dos trabajan elaborando los huipiles, las blusas tradicionales de Guatemala, mientras que una se\u00f1ora borda los huipiles. Ella borda los huipiles con bellos p\u00e1jaros, rosas o s\u00edmbolos mayas. Do\u00f1a Adela una mujer de car\u00e1cter fuerte y alegre al mismo tiempo, muy t\u00edpico de las mujeres de la costa de Guatemala, vende refacciones y ropa americana. Finalmente, Karla R. trabaja en el negocio de cosm\u00e9ticos. Ella compra cosm\u00e9ticos por cat\u00e1logo y los vende de casa en casa. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Estrellas de Atitl\u00e1n es un grupo que amerita el apoyo de todos. Es un grupo que se ha consolidado a lo largo del tiempo y que han trabajado muy bien. Debido a eso, es importante que Friendship Bridge y ustedes por medio de Kiva apoyen a este grupo de mujeres talentosas, aguerridas y trabajadoras."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":157540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She lives in a rented house with her little daughter and is willing to work hard to give her a good life.\r\n\r\nIn the comfort of her home Victoria weaves her colorful handmade clothing. She works every day beginning very early because she needs to fill orders for a trader from the United States, who takes her clothing to sell in his country.\r\n\r\nBut Victoria does not only sell what she weaves. She also collects a larger amount of clothing from other weavers, who in turn receive a fair payment for their work.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is that in some way she also helps her fellow women to move forward.

She lives with her two daughters, ages 13 and 10, who are students at the school in Ilopango and completely dependent on her.  Nora is a single mother and does not receive any financial support.  She sells detergents in powder and liquid form, as well as bleach for whitening clothes.  Nora sells her products door to door, which has proven very practical since she has been in this same business for the past six years.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting a loan because she wants to buy detergents, bleach, and toilet paper.

In order to increase their working capital, the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso  loan program where  they have their first solidarity loan.  Mrs. Korotoumou C. plans to use her loan to buy ten boxes of soap. She stocks up on soap wholesale at the Segou Grand Market and sells her merchandise retail, for cash and on credit, at home, door-to-door and at the M\u00e9dine market to a clientele composed of men and women.

Aunque ella acept\u00f3 la idea,  pens\u00f3 que era un reto muy grande dedicarse a este negocio,  especialmente   los s\u00e1bados y festivos cuando la actividad es de mayor movimiento,  pues en su condici\u00f3n de madre sola con 4 hijos se le dificultaba, pero de todas maneras  acept\u00f3 el desaf\u00edo y le agreg\u00f3 adem\u00e1s de la venta de bebidas, refrescos,  jugos naturales y fritangueria, actividad que   ven\u00eda realizando y adicionalmente tambi\u00e9n pidi\u00f3 a su primo que trabajara con ella   los fines de semanas.

She dreams of supporting her children until they become successful adults.  Luisa's household income comes from her business called \"Estadero mi Padrino y Yo\" where she sells beer, natural juices and fried food.\r\n\r\nA little over one year ago, Luisa's cousin, who started the business, went to live in a very beautiful place on the Caribbean coast in Colombia: La Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.  He suggested to Luisa that she take over his business, making her a gift of a cooler.  Although she accepted the idea, she considered it a very big challenge taking over the business, especially on Saturdays and holidays when things are at their busiest.  Luisa is a single mother with four children which makes things difficult.  However, she accepted the challenge and started soda, soft drinks, natural juices and fried food.  She also asked a cousin to work with her on weekends.  In carrying out her business every day, it has gradually become stronger.  She started the business in her home but currently works in her uncle's house because he has the infrastructure she needs: a cooler, a blender and equipment for storing the beer and juice.\r\n\r\nLuisa's dream is to diversify her business and increase her sales since her number of customers has increased and she doesn't have much capital with which to respond to demand.  Her biggest challenge is serving in her business since it is very difficult for her as a woman living on her own.  Her children are not yet able to support her because they are still young.  Luisa continues working to fulfil her dreams, making profits of no less than 26%.
