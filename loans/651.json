Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":24387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Their main concerns were the low salaries being paid, which led to a lack of teachers in schools and a low quality education for students.  Why has one of the most important professions such as teaching become one of the least paid jobs?\r\n\r\nSuidumkan B. is a leader of this group.   The low salary for teachers made it inevitable for her to start her own  business. In 2000, Suidumkan and her husband, a forester, applied for a loan at a local bank.  The 20,000 soms loan and some of her savings allowed Suidumkan to start a business in cattle breeding. The family business gave them the opportunity to purchase a car  \u2013 an old Russian \u201cJiguli\u201d  model, which helped cut some  transportation expenses.  Unfortunately, 3000 soms of monthly income is too little, so they applied for this loan in order to purchase 12 heads of cattle.  \r\n\r\nSuidumkan and her group is thankful to Kiva and all lenders, who are not indifferent to changing their lives. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She is single and has 2 children: Angel Adair, who is 6 months old, and Kevin Jesus, who is 4. She sells lingerie and fashion jewelry for a living. She has requested this loan in order to purchase bras, camisoles, panties, undergarments for boys and girls, twin bead ponytail holders, headbands, etc. She started this business a year ago with the money that she had from a tanda--a rotating savings and credit association, which is a popular form of saving money in Mexico. She started out selling gelatin, then decided to launch a lingerie business. This business is very important because she supports her family with it. She feels very proud of her work and of her good customer service. Furthermore, she is able to take care of her children with this business. She wants to expand her business by selling baby clothes, and she plans on doing so with the profits from the lingerie sales. She hopes that her children grow up without want, and dreams that she can give them either a plot of land or a property, as well as a good education. The members of this group would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad that they are grateful for allowing them the opportunity to launch a business. Erika states, \"For me, as a single mother, sometimes it is good receive help because at times, we cannot do it alone.

In 1999, Mrs. Ngoai joined the TYM Fund and borrowed the first loan of 300,000VND (about 20USD) to invest in raising livestock. Besides livestock, she also invested in planting fruit trees to take advantage of her large garden. Currently, both her husband and she focus on planting fruit trees and raising livestock to increase their family's income. After 9 years, her family's economy has improved tremendously, and she is able to send all her children to school. This time, she would like to borrow 900USD to invest further in planting fruit trees and raising livestock. Her family's monthly income is 3,000,000VND (about 200USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by P.

When we visited Sonia, she was very sad and angry, because the night before her corn, which is very costly until it matures, from her farm was stolen. As a result, she plans to sell the corn that she still has at a higher price in the market, so she won\u2019t end up with a large loss. Sonia works every day in agriculture with her husband, since it is their primary source of income. She alternates the crops that she grows; in January, she sows gladioli, which she harvests in May. In April, she sows peas, and in October, she plants potatoes. She spends all of her time working on her crops, which generates good earnings. Because of this, she will buy land in the next few months, where she will build her own house so that she can offer her children more comforts. This is her eighth loan with MFP, and she has made her repayments on time. Also, she likes to attend the meetings at her community bank, where she takes advantage of talking to and having a good time with her neighbors.

Instead, she and her husband helped one another. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, Myrna found an opportunity to acquire business capital. She joined ASHI and she was inspired by the stories of poor women of ASHI. She wanted to become successful like them. Therefore, the loans that she has taken since then are used for her business. Because of the opportunity to borrow, Myrna was able to open variety store and sell vegetables and, recently, she started selling fish. She is courageous enough to take all the risks of running a business. She thought she could be successful because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream she kept in her mind -- having all of her remaining children graduate from college. \r\n\r\nMyrna had never hoped anything but to prevent her children from experiencing the hard life that she and her husband had experienced.

She is 60 years old. Bernandena is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tundan 2.\r\n\r\nBernandena is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Bernandena owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruits like banana, mango, avocado and lanzones in the local community. Bernandena has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bernandena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Bernandena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Bernandena is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Bernandena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a single mother and has a 17 year-old daughter with whom she lives in the Guanaste neighborhood in the town of San Esteban, Olancho.\r\n\r\nDoris has been selling groceries for twenty years and her grocery store is called 'Vecinos y Amigos' (Neighbors and Friends).  Her shop is open from 6.00am to 7.00pm and while she runs her business and does her housework, her daughter goes to school.  She learned to work because her father taught her and now Doris is very happy to have her own business since it has allowed her to have an income with which she can look after herself and her daughter and cover her household bills such as water and electricity. Her difficulty is that there are many businesses of the same type in the neighborhood and this means that sales drop.  Sometimes her daughter's school expenses are high and she has no way of paying them.\r\n\r\nDoris is requesting her loan because she is building her house and needs to buy materials such as wood, blocks and bags of cement, sand and iron rods.  She also needs to pay workmen.  With the support of the loan she hopes to be able to finish building her house bit by bit and, in the near future, be able to move into it.  Her goal is to work hard every day so that her daughter does not want for anything.  She would also like to save so that her daughter can go to university and become a professional.  This is her eighth loan with FAMA.  With the financing she has obtained she has been able to improve her business and her quality of

is a 34-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing\/fish vending business. She lives in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Renalyn is borrowing PHP 21,000 to purchase fishing gears and equipment. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Renalyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. Her photo was taken after the center meeting. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is where the idea to sell them arose.  Since she did well, she decided to add other similar products, like helmets, to her motorcycle accessories business.  She installed well-stocked display cases. \r\n\r\n Her business has been growing well and she\u2019s excited to help it grow because she expects to see profits very soon.  This is why she\u2019s calling on Kiva to pay cash for larger amounts of material to make vests and handles as well as to buy a sewing machine so that she can start manufacturing higher quality items herself.  \r\n\r\nGloria has received six loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo during the last two years that have helped her business progress.  While Gloria strives to reach her business dreams, she maintains a profit margin of no less than 42.9% that she foresees will continue to strengthen her family income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":838873,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay cash for materials at wholesale and to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Arjona (Bolivar)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-09T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Alba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75368},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81598},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83162},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":84756},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":86381},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88036},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89724},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91443},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93196},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":94982},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96803},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104551}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.02,"local_amount":75368,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":77613.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803704},{"amount":47.67,"local_amount":81598,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":84028.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614781},{"amount":48.57,"local_amount":83162,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":85639.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568736},{"amount":49.51,"local_amount":84756,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87280.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780065},{"amount":50.45,"local_amount":86381,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88954.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188459},{"amount":51.43,"local_amount":88036,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90658.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324675},{"amount":52.41,"local_amount":89724,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":92396.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038735},{"amount":53.41,"local_amount":91443,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":94167.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650897},{"amount":54.44,"local_amount":93196,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":95972.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140505},{"amount":55.48,"local_amount":94982,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":97811.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100438},{"amount":117.61,"local_amount":201354,"processed_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":207352.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338070}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T17:22:54Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:35:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":327954,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 46 years old.

Together with her husband, they are blessed with three children. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and sheep farming. Because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek advice on the best farming practices. Farida has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. \n\nDairy farming in Nandihills is a very profitable venture. In the recent past, milk prices have been going up, so Farida, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she knows that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy-processing firms. \n\nShe underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions.

am Mumtaz B. and I live in Lahore, the second largest city of Pakistan, with my husband and six children. My husband is a wall painter, however, his income is not a steady source of money because he is just on on-call, contract work. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a living, I make paper envelopes. A shopkeeper gives me the raw material (paper) and then I turn this into envelopes. Despite this dedicated and hard work, I am underpaid for my work.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI know that it is very important to get our children educated these days but I am not in a position to afford paying for their education.

She learned to make them thanks to the support of her mother, who taught her how to prepare them from a very young age, so that it would serve her as a business with which she could support her children.\r\n\r\nToday, she has come to Ceprodel to ask for loans that will help her buy the necessary ingredients, such as mint leaves, onions, sweet peppers, tomatoes, and pork.

This is 30 year old Stella K. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one child, who is one year old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\r\n<p>\r\nStella has been running a charcoal business since 2007. Charcoal is used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite a good business. Stella works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by her husband. Stella currently earns about 100 USD from her business.\r\n<p>\r\nStella is requesting a loan in order to purchase stock in bulk. In the future, she plans to open another business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":303876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

V. is a 26-year-old woman living in the town of Nonoa.  She is single and does not have any chlidren.  To make a living, Apineru owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Apineru has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Apineru joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Apineru has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Apineru is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Apineru plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: <p>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem. <p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 40 years old. Bernadette is married. To make a living, Bernadette owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" (variety) store where she sells daily-use products and dried goods in the local community. Bernadette has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Bernadette joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bernadette is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP that she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Bernadette's first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

For the past two years Ramazon has sold rice. This is a profitable business in his neighborhood, and his sales have increased considerably year after year. His start-up capital was from the severance pay he received from where he used to work. \r\n\r\nTo expand his business, Ramazon is requesting a loan of $3000, which he intends to use for increasing the size of his inventory.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Together they have a child who is in university. They live in their own home located in the Puerto Mayo town, in the Pichari district. From a very young age Beatriz has worked in agriculture, specifically in the cultivation of cocoa. However, when she started her family, her husband's economic support meant that she was able to acquire a small plot of land where they cultivated cocoa and coffee. With the passing of the years, they had their son Joel. This meant that Joel's dear father has had to sacrifice a lot for him, as Beatriz could not help out and occupied herself with the housework. As their son grew, she was able more and more to work and support her husband in the agricultural tasks. Thus she wants to open a store in which she can sell clothing. This will be her second loan from MFP, so she hopes for the support of each and every one of you in order to achieve her goals. She also promises to be punctual with the repayments of her quotas. With the money that she is requesting, she will invest in contracting labourers to help with the removal of the weeds that are growing in her cocoa fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":811199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to contract labourers.

She is 40 years old and married with three children who are currently studying. Gracia is happily living with her husband and children in the community of San Miguel Ramon. She has been using her skills in manicuring, pedicuring, hair coloring, and hair cutting. Because Gracia doesn't have an established beauty salon, she travels from house to house to satisfy her customers' needs. She is grateful because she is able to earn about PHP 10,000 per month, which she uses to meet her family's daily needs, to provide allowances and tuition fees for her children, and to buy feed to raise hogs.\r\n\r\nGracia and her husband work hard to meet the needs of their family. Her husband is a farmer, and at times he doesn't have to look after his rice field. So he has been doing construction activities to provide additional income. Gracia still needs additional capital due to increased household expenses and the costs of her hog-raising business. \r\n\r\nGracia is requesting a loan of PHP 20,000, which she will use to purchase materials such as nail polish remover, nail polish, and hair coloring for her beauty business.

She resides with her husband and family. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 5 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. Lorna passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \n\nLorna is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg production, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will further increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she intends to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. \n\nIn addition to profits, Lorna will benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer.

She has 3 children and is married to a husband who is currently unemployed. She is a school teacher and would like to use this loan to buy more books for the children in her school and expand her business. She heard about K-MET because the school she teaches in is located next to the church where K-MET teaches community-based health workers. We had a chance to see her at work at the school and her children love her. When it comes time to journal, we will upload pictures of some of the children and a picture of the school.  Mercy says that she would like lenders to know that if you believe in something that is good, you can make it happen. <P>\r\n\r\nMercy recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, hog raising and motorcycle transport. Her husband Osias, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have three children who are between 7 and 16 years old. Josefina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Josefina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is 43 years old and he is a very happy and hardworking man. He is married to Celsa who is 40 years old and their relationship produced 2 daughters, Karina, 16 years old, and Ana Maria, 13. They live together in a home that is their own in the district of Santa Rosa. Fabian started his adventure as an agriculturist since he was a boy on his parents' land. His passion for agriculture led him to acquire his own land where he has been working independently for the past 11 years. He cultivates cocoa, coffee, and coca leaves. During the harvest he has help from farm hands who can quickly harvest the product and he therefore is able to advance with his work. He feels a great sense of commitment to his work. It is thanks to his daily efforts that today he is able to enjoy the fruits that the plants give him. He has obtained good earnings for each kilogram of product he has sold. He says that the winter season is not his favorite because during those months insects and rain are in abundance and it prevents him from doing his work efficiently and the products of the plantations are damaged. \r\n\r\nThe loan which he requests will be used to acquire cocoa plants to graft them and take full advantage of the product when the weather is better. But his priority now is to purchase new land in order to expand his plantations and to increase production. This is his eighth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to make all of his payments on time, especially because he wishes to access other loans in the future. He is a very well liked member of is communal bank. With the 500 nuevos soles which he requests, he will purchase cocoa plants to graft them and to take full advantage of the good weather season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":742693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cocoa plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T11:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621123}],"funded_date":"2011-03-31T21:33:19Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":291100,"name":"Dana Kerti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jro Ayu Putu P.

She is a widow as her husband passed away after more than 15 years of marriage. She has 6 children and 3 grandchildren, but only the 3 youngest children (ranging from 14 to 8 years old) and the 3 grandchildren live with her. They all attend school, apart from the youngest grandchild who is only 3 years old.<p>Albertina moved with her family to Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, when she was little. She went to school until third grade, but stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. She got pregnant with her first son at 17 years old and has been living with her future husband ever since, taking care of the house and the children.<p>Soon after Albertina\u2019s husband passed away in 2001, Albertina started to sell clothes in Namaacha. She has a stand at the local open market that is open twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays). During the other days of the week, Albertina sells from her house. The most sold items are sheets; each is sold for Mozambique Metical (MZN)15 or 30, depending on the quality and design. Albertina goes to Maputo to buy merchandise once a month, paying around MZN60 in transportation costs. At the market, Albertina makes between MZN300 and 1,500 per day, really depending on the season and weather conditions.<p>Albertina first heard of Hluvuku through a friend who was a client. This will be Albertina\u2019s second loan. The first loan was used to buy inventory and helped increase sales. Albertina was extremely happy with the loan, as it helped her buy basic needs for her children and also increase her monthly profits. This time Albertina intends to use the loan to buy winter clothes, as winter will soon start and she thinks she will be able to sell a lot.<p>In the future, Albertina would like to ask for a new loan to help her finish building a shop in front of her house, where she would be able to sell not only clothes, but also food and basic needs products. The picture shows Albertina with the sheets at her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":149593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Askarali is a dynamic and ambitious young man, very professional and focused on his business. He has a business selling cement and feed for cattle in the neighborhood of \u201cDehkon\u201d market. He has been in this business for 4 years and has gained a rich experience. He has a special warehouse where he keeps his goods in safety. He knows how to store cement so that it doesn\u2019t deteriorate.<P>\r\n\r\n All this allows Askarali to make his business quite successful and it brings in stable income for his family. With the profit from his business he has been continuously supporting his 4 children with education and food. Today, knowing that the price of the cement is presently low but will increase soon for sure, he wants to purchase more goods to store up. For this reason he is asking for a loan of 3000 USD for the term of 12 months. Askarali expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.     <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, because they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She has a pair of 12-year-old twins, and a 3 year old; the twins are studying. She resides in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood. Her husband works as a conductor on the routes that transport thousands of Nicaraguans daily to their jobs. With much effort and in hopes of helping in her household, Erica took the initiative to begin selling clothing to help husband with expenses. She began this business with savings and later with loans from Afodenic. She has sold large quantities of clothing and cosmetics for ten years, and with this loan she will be able to invest in the purchase of assorted clothing and cosmetics to offer her clients, and this will also help her acquire new clients. She sells for cash payments or on credit. She thanks the Afodenic institution for the good that she has accomplished to date. In the future she hopes to continue making improvements to her home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva

Mr. Oeurn S. is a village bank president who has been selected by the members. He is a farmer who owns 1-hectar field to cultivate rice to earn for living. In this farming, he now faces a small problem because he does not have enough moN. to buy fertilizers to support the field so he decided to buy fertilizers to make his crop more productive and he also use the rest of the loan to buy piglets and pig food for breeding. His wife, Mrs. Teav Chantha, helps him on the farming. Mr. Oeurn S. is 25 years old and the father of a child who is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of a year. \n\nAll the members in this village bank loans are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<p>\r\n\r\nVilma, who is married and has 2 school-aged children, owns and operates a general store whose income derives primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Vilma has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan, her third, of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ligaya has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family's needs. \r\n\r\nLigaya D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She lives with her partner, 40 year-old David, and they have two children: 10 year-old Leydi and 2 year-old Jhosep.  They live together in their own home which is located in Quimbiri district.\r\n\r\nNora's parents taught her the value of work and the need to work hard to earn money since she was a little girl.  Nora's business activity is buying products from farmers, such as coffee, annatto, cacao and turmeric.  These are all products which are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac River Valley.\r\n\r\nNora has been working for 14 years and she has the support of her partner who is in charge of loading and weighing the produce.  Nora then takes the produce and sells it to well-known wholesalers such as Cooperativa Agraria, Cacao Vrae and Machupichu who pay her a percentage for every kilogram of produce she delivers.  Nora's business makes her a good quantity of money each year.  However, January, February and March are rainy months and roads wash away.  This affects the journeys that she makes to transport her products.\r\n\r\nNora's plans are to continue working with the same determination in order to get the members of her family ahead in life.  She will use the loan she has requested as capital so that she can buy products from farmers.  This is Nora's 11th loan from MFP and she has been very punctual in repaying her previous loans.  Nora is a member of a community bank.  However, because she is a member who repays her loans punctually, she is also able to access an individual loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":742740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

They had great expectations to be successful in their work.

His family is made up of his wife and their 4 children, aged from 26 to 35. They have especially seen improvements in the condition of their home.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is the first loan that Rogelio has had through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With it he will purchase a variety of merchandise, such as eye glasses, t-shirts, hooks, school supplies, sandals, and ladies' accessories. His goal for the future is to restart production, especially because he has the infrastructure ready to use, and to sell in retail and through other merchants. His greatest challenge is his working capital. IN comparison with the competition the business is very small to be able to respond to client demands in an opportune manner. While he works on expanding, he directs all of his efforts to maintain his business profitable. Currently that represents a profit margin of no less than 50%. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":771786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a variety of merchandise, such as eye glasses, t-shirts, hooks, school supplies, sandals, and ladies' accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-20T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71267},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81520},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83082},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84674},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86297},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87951},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89637},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91355},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93106},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94891},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96709},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109511}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.39},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":71267,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":72532.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509534},{"amount":92.3,"local_amount":164602,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167524.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320289},{"amount":47.48,"local_amount":84674,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":86177.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803419},{"amount":48.39,"local_amount":86297,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":87829.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568460},{"amount":99.58,"local_amount":177588,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":180741.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779803},{"amount":51.23,"local_amount":91355,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":92977.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188212},{"amount":105.42,"local_amount":187997,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":191335.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038502},{"amount":54.23,"local_amount":96709,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":98426.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650693},{"amount":61.41,"local_amount":109511,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":111455.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140320}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T13:33:00Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303410,"name":"Hasifa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasifa lives in the city of Kampala, Uganda.

He joined One Acre Fund for One Acre Fund\u2019s best prices and to ensure food security for his family and later educate them.

Before joining One Acre Fund,  Dismus was only able to harvest 2 \u00bd bags of maize on \u00bd acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Dismus and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Dismus will educate his children and invest in raising livestock.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Nanjikabe SHG group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Dismus is pictured with his group members. The field officer appears on the far left.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":914945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T23:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margrit ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dismus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":45150,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":45694.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680712}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T20:12:39Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":360814,"name":"Shahera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahera, 24, is married and has one son.
