Atebubu is a town that has most of its inhabitants actively involved in the farming business. \r\n\r\nVery few are into different trades such as batik and tie-dye production and Hashmud is one of those few.  Batik and tie-dye is a local textile design in which raffia or waxes are used to resist the pigment (dyes) from getting to undesired areas.  \r\n\r\nHashmud buys materials such as mercerized cotton, caustic soda, etc from the city.  He has been in this business for six years.  He sells in the local market and treks to surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nHashmud wants a loan to buy more of the raw materials so that he can produce on a large scale to be able to trek to more markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":244404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy tie-dyeing materials.

Mrs. Thach T. is 43 years old and the mother of two children who are enrolled in the local school. Mr. Rorn S. does not come to take a loan but his wife does, so she is presented in the picture instead. \r\n\r\nOne member in this group has an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":293122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

The couple is blessed with three children namely: Patrick John, 17 years of age, a second year college student; John Paul, 14 years old; and the youngest is Marichu, who is now 11 years old.\r\n\r\nRemedios\u2019s general store is situated at her house at Villa Marcos, Ramon.

If she gets this loan, Sarah will purchase additional goods, mainly foodstuffs like rice, sugar, etc. With these additional goods, Sarah will hopefully earn more profit which will allow her to keep reinvesting for better financial stability."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":556649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of goods, mainly foodstuffs, to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Ruhengeri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-06-19T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152782075},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":105000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":107034.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037341},{"amount":35,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172309048},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":127421.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616653},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622852},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760676},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63710.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497608}],"funded_date":"2010-06-19T16:32:11Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":212880,"name":"Lubov's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lubov P. is the leader of this group.

She is married and has 2 children aged 7 and 1. In 1996, she established her business making brass religious statues. Working 7 days a week and 6 hours a day, she supoorts her family. She has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buys raw materials like bronze, wax, silver, etc., for her work. In the future, Laxmi plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts. Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand-tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower

People come to his store as it is located in very busy area and, for this reason, his products sell out very quickly.  Hilmer has been in this business for two years and what he most enjoys about his work is chatting to his customers.  He hopes that his business will grow and make him better income.\r\n\r\nThis will be Hilmer's second loan from MFP and he hopes not to miss any repayments.  He is a very committed and supportive member of his community bank.  He will use the 1,000 Peruvian soles he has requested to buy more products for his grocery store so that he has better stock to offer his customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":779305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his store with more products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilmer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":153.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":157.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":162.09},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":168.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":181.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.79},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.48,"local_amount":153.29,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":157.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550399},{"amount":59.2,"local_amount":157.86,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":162.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719075},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":688.85,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":709.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350539}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T08:31:07Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":307131,"name":"Natalia","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" \nNasceu na Provincia de Sofala, centro de Mo\u00e7ambique, tem 36 anos de idade \u00e9 casada,  m\u00e3e de 2 filhos,de 9 e 18 anos, todos v\u00e3o  a Escola.

Trash is not actively separated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Paz's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund used to buy trash from collectors.

Nevertheless, now at 28 years old, he continues striving for his future beloved wife and family.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

from the city of Cuenca. The climate is lovely and varied. The land is good for crops. They grow corn, beans, potatoes, and green vegetables. The harvest is not large because the people are leaving to work in the city, but is enough to supply the farmers and the community. They also raise their own animals, as well as those of others, such as cattle, sheep, chicken, and geese. Maria is 40 years old, is married, and has 4 children aged 21, 18, 16, and 15 years. The 21 year-old studies at the SECAP, a professional training center in Cuenca.  The remaining three children study at the high school in Valle. Her husband works as a bricklayer in the city of Cuenca.  She says that the neighborhood is peaceful and united and her family lives in harmony there. She is president of the Communal Bank, has raised livestock for 10 years, and attends livestock markets on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays in different parts of the province. She says that the business is profitable and almost never loses money.  When the fair goes badly her only returns are the original capital, but in general she earns approximately $30-40 per head of cattle.

She regularly attends the weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow ten times in CCT\u2019s cooperative.\r\n\r\nPaz is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy different kinds of meat for her store. Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 4,700 per month.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, Paz would like to obtain a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying pork and other meats from wholesale butchers.\r\n\r\nPaz dreams that her business will continue to improve with more loyal customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

This will help him to improve his sales and make more income so that he can gradually achieve his dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":809726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock for his fruit and vegetable store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2011-07-15T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dar\u00edo De Jes\u00fas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":71531},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":73487},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75497},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":77561},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":79682},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":81861},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":84100},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86400},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88762},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":91190},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93683},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96246}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.41},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":71531,"processed_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":72389.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227220329},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":75731,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":76639.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232834122},{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":73253,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":74132.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238646050},{"amount":44.66,"local_amount":77663,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78594.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244600481},{"amount":45.59,"local_amount":79288,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":80239.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250814771},{"amount":46.85,"local_amount":81478,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82455.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257223560},{"amount":48.74,"local_amount":84775,"processed_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85792.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263361578},{"amount":262.36,"local_amount":456281,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":461756.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270074952}],"funded_date":"2011-07-21T03:06:22Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":319441,"name":"And Soukali Jeeguene Pire 10 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est compos\u00e9 de 5 membres qui habitent dans le village de Pire \u00e0 cent km de DAKAR la capitale du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, leur activit\u00e9 principale est le commerce de produits agricoles  les tubercules de manioc.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has 7 children, but she lives with only two of them, in a rented house in a neighborhood of Santa Ana. Her exuberant happiness causes everyone who knows her to like her, and they appreciate her hard-working and determined nature. After her husband's death, she was overcome with sorrow and did not know where to go, until a year ago she arrived in this place and began growing coffee, bananas and avocados on lands she owns. The beauty of her fields helped her forget her original home and her sorrows, and she also received help from her children and neighbors. What she likes best is applying fertilizer to her fields, because she knows she must take very good care of them so they will produce a bountiful harvest. For the future, she would like to buy additional hectares of agricultural land and also construct a house, so that her children can feel secure and enjoy the tranquility they deserve. This is her first loan with MFP, and she assures us that her word means more than any paper she can sign, and she will make all of her payments without any delays. She is also very enthusiastic about working with her communal bank, where everyone received her with open arms. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy 500 coffee plants and some sacks of fertilizer. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":539882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying 500 coffee plants and some sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-15T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ciencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449420}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T18:35:13Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":204719,"name":"Adjouavi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1973 au B\u00e9nin, G.

Feredugu R.C. Primary School. This school was founded on the 9th of September 1960 by the Catholic Mission to foster education in the Chiefdom. Currently, the school is staffed with eight teachers and has 400 pupils. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that this school has applied for from SMT\/Kiva lenders. Michael M.W. D. (who is sitting in front) is their leader and headmaster at the school. The fifty-eight-year-old Michael was born in Kambia, a town in northern Sierra Leone. He has been in the teaching profession for thirty-eight years now. He is married to a teacher and they have eight children - two are in secondary school and one is in college; the rest are now grown-ups and living on their own.\r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMr. D., leader of this group, has requested this loan in order to construct a dwelling for his family. \u201cThis loan will ease some of my difficulties,\u201d said Mr. D., \u201cand will be a great development aid for my family,\u201d he concluded.

She offers her clients a catalogue full of items she sells. Yesenia then collects and places the orders. When she receives the products, she makes deliveries. She also maintains an inventory of products she knows to be popular. She hopes to use this loan to invest in various plastic products in preparation for the Christmas season, when she expects to experience an upsurge in demand for her products. Recently, her main obstacle has been a lack of working capital, necessary to make investments in inventory. \r\n\r\nIn general, Yesenia carries out the domestic responsibilities of cooking and cleaning the house in the mornings. In the afternoons, she dedicates her time to her business, making sales, purchasing inventory or collecting repayments. A long-term goal for Yesenia is to one day own a centralized location where her clients would be able to peruse the various items she has for sale. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":624682,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase plastic household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Ipis","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-25T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14808.32},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15055.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15306.05},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15561.15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15820.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16084.18},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16352.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16624.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16901.86},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17183.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17469.95},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17761.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18057.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18358.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18655.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.11},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.62,"local_amount":14808.32,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":14814.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551373},{"amount":30.11,"local_amount":15055.14,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15061.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148790},{"amount":402.96,"local_amount":201480.61,"processed_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-28T08:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":201561.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259109957},{"amount":37.31,"local_amount":18655.93,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":18663.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263326242}],"funded_date":"2010-10-25T23:13:53Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":245697,"name":"Yadira De Los Angeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yadira De Los \u00c1ngeles tiene 48 a\u00f1os, su actividad es una librer\u00eda.

She is married to Elmer, age 36, and they have four children.  Gloria and her family live in their own home in the community of Pampa Miraflores, an annex of the District of Santa Rosa.  Gloria and her partner Elmer are the breadwinners of their family.  When she was a young girl, her parents taught her how to work in the fields.  Gloria is a farmer and has four hectares of land on which she grows coffee, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lonchocarpus_urucu\" target=\"_blank\" >barbasco<\/a>, and coca leaves since these plants are native to the rain forest zone of the Apurimac River Valley.  She has been working on her land for eleven years.  During the harvest season, she has the help of her children and the labor of workers who can gather fruit very rapidly.  What he enjoys most about her job is harvesting her crops because she feels the months of hard work are rewarded with the quality of her output.  She considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products from the field to the collection centers located in the city of San Francisco.  These places offer the best prices for her products.  Her main challenge is not having sufficient income to pay her workers in advance so that they can help her with the harvest.  For this reason, she is accessing the loans provided by MFP.  Her priority at the moment is to plant more coffee since she has one hectare of land that remains uncultivated.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP.  Gloria feels the loan will be a great help in advancing her business.  In her Communal Bank, she is well-respected by the other members.  The loan of 1000 PEN that she is requesting will be used to hire workers to help with the harvest.

She has been working in this field for 5 years, for this reason she knows how to cautiously select the people who work with her cars. The good thing about her job is that she does not have to perform any activity, only to pay attention to the car routes, but she thinks that the abuse of the transit police is detrimental to the normal functioning of her vehicles and she tries to fight with them constantly.

He gets additional income from farming which comes to about Kshs 3,000 per month. Richard\u2019s customers are mainly residents of Kabarnet Town and those visiting the town.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Kandie plans to use the Kshs 20,000 from KADET limited to purchase stock for the hotel. This loan marks his first loan from KADET. Whatever profit he earns he plans to use to boost his business by expanding his hotel to be able to accommodate about 100 customers per sitting. He also plans to offers accommodation or rather lodging services to his customers, which he doesn\u2019t do at the moment. \r\n<p>\r\nRichard dreams of expanding his hotel business to a five star hotel. He also hopes to give his children the best education he can afford. \r\n<p>\r\nRichard describes himself as hard-working and determined to achieve his goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":476855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stock for the hotel.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"KABARNET","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T21:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richard Kandie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:35:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123962377},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128976924},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3479.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136703195},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":3331.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-16T08:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3476.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144885467},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3478.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151921205},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-19T09:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3478.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160095653}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T22:57:19Z","paid_date":"2010-08-19T09:10:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eva van Emden","image":1021631}},{"id":175629,"name":"Sa Rorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sa Rorn K. is 42 years old and she lives in Samna Khmau village in Takeo province.

She is 41 years old. Cora is married and has 8 adult-aged children. To make a living, Cora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Cora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

Gemma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9000 PHP helped her to earn a monthly profit of 6500 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP which she intends to add to her own savings to purchase a fishing boat and to use as operating capital so that she could continue to earn enough and save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. Gemma L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her family lives in a small house in the outer ger (traditional Mongolian housing tent) districts. \r\nShe sells clothes at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. Her husband works as a plumber at a local company. \r\nUsually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract at Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand. When Delgermurun first began her business in 2003, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time.\r\nIn 2005, however, Delgermurun had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. Now her working capital is 3,300,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT), and she sells clothes at her own two stalls.\r\nFor the past 8 years, Delgermurun and her husband have been successfully improving their living conditions gradually. For example, they built their own small house in 2010 and then they bought a used car with 8,000,000 MN of their business earnings in January, 2011. So, Delgermurun\u2019s working capital decreased.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 2,500,000 MNT, Delgermurun will purchase more clothes from Ereen City, China. Delgermurun wants to use this loan to help support her in this very busy shopping season of the year.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":791668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She\u2019s married but she was divorced many years ago.  She\u2019s the mother of seven children who are all now independent adults.  She now lives with her new companion who she shares her days with working much and giving each other the support they need to have the life style they deserve.\r\n\r\nRosalina\u2019s work consists in selling used clothes and plastic ware.  She buys in large quantities and then goes to towns and hamlets along the Ucayali River banks to sell for cash or in exchange for a few animals or products.  She\u2019s been in this business seven years and she does it alongside her husband.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite profitable for her to go to the towns along the river to sell because she earns twice what she spends.  When she sells for cash she earns less than when she trades for animals because back in the city she doubles or triples the amount.  She likes he work very much because she\u2019s always had a free, adventurous spirit.  Before starting this work she\u2019d stay home alone because her husband traveled a lot and one day she decided to go with him and not stay home alone.  Besides, she always had to depend on her husband\u2019s earnings and now she\u2019s economically independent.

She is 21 years old and lives with her husband in the Kitale area of Kenya. She is blessed with two children who are her greatest motivation in life. She perseveres because she wants to provide a better future for them. Janet was unable to study to have a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. \n\nJanet has always had an affinity for farming. Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows, which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her dairy cows. Her cows produce between 10-15 liters a day and this helps her support her family. Janet also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs. \n\nThat is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, she will be able to purchase high quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \n\nJanet is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production over the previous year and also build a modern house.

This school was opened in 1973 by the Roman Catholic Mission to educate the children of Lunsar and it environs. Presently, the school has 15 teachers and 636 pupils.   \r\n<br>This is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other school staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n<br>Alpha P. B., aged 58, is a teacher at the school and leader of this group. Born in Freetown, Sierra Leone\u2019s capital city, Alpha now lives and works in Lunsar. He has been in the teaching profession for 38 years now. He is a widower and has seven children \u2013 five adults and two attending secondary schools. Mr B. has requested this loan from Kiva lenders in order to buy house-building materials. Your loan will go a long way in helping Alpha build a dwelling house, as he is in dire need of a house for his family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":751811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy house-building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Lunsar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2011-04-16T10:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alpha P.

This district is well-known in the country for maize and nut growing. Amiran is 37 years old and a farmer. He lives in the village with his parents, who are retired and actively involved in the family agricultural business, which is the primary source of the income for them. \r\n\r\nAmiran has one bull and a milk cow, which gives them approximately 20 kg of cheese per month. It is sold to local dairy product retailers. They also have nut trees and sell 180-200 kg nuts per season. Two hectares of family-owned land are used for maize growing, where in total eight tons of maize is harvested. Half of the harvested maize is sold to local retailers and the rest is used in the dairy farm. On another two hectares of land the family grows four tons of musk-melon and 20 tons of watermelons. The total average monthly income of the family is 400 Laris. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan Amiran plans to purchase fertilizers for the melon garden.

failure. One has to be innovative, open-minded and have the ability to make decisions independently and under pressure to make progress. That's from the perspective of 46-year-old David, a been there, done that, down-to-earth father of four buoyant kids who plies his carpentry trade in Rukungiri. He has been in this business for close to 20 years.\r\n\r\nDavid makes an array of timber products at his workshop, such as chairs, tables, desks, sideboards, etc. He, at length, resells most of his products to his clientele, new and old alike. The good quality of his products has won him laurels. He has been able to consolidate on his achievements in the past 16 years, albeit with hard work and determination.\r\n\r\nFarming is his other side source of income. As a matter of fact, David says he took root in his carpentry business with savings from his farming business. This business' gross monthly sales revenue is the sum of Uganda shillings 250,000. David says he intends to use this Kiva Loan to purchase more timber for use at his workshop.

They had seven children but now she lives alone in her own house in the Tambo district.  For over 30 years she has been selling clothing, especially children's clothing, for which there is more demand and she is better known.  She travels to the different fairs in the city of Jauja every week.  But the Christmas holiday is when sales peak, during the Christmas fairs on main street in the city of Huancayo.  She earns twice as much profit so she is always anxious for the season to arrive.  She also sells typical beverages on weekends in the wholesale market and rents out rooms in her house for extra income.  Now her goal is to leave something for her grandchildren for when she is not around.  She belongs to the communal bank \"IDME\" and this is her 23 loans through MFP.

Now, she is applying for another loan to buy more plastic shoppers to expand her son\u2019s business. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is joined in her loan group by the following entrepreneurs: (1) Aneela Shaheen baji seeks a loan in order to buy cloth and thread for her boutique; (2) Sakeena baji is in need of a loan for her furniture business; (3) Rahat Baji requests a loan to buy more clothes for her clothing business; and (4) Waheeda baji would like a loan to buy wood to make more furniture. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. As such, the loan proceeds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest the funds into her own business. The members mutually guarantee the other members' loans so that the other members are responsible if one member does not repay."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":190975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To

She works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Enesi currently earns about US $200 a month from her business.

Enesi thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase red palm seeds in bulk for oil extraction","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enesi D.

It is purely a fishing region, which is located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThey run a small restaurant where they wait on the fishermen in the region.  The business allowed them to buy a piece of land where they are now building their house.  They are now living there.  But, there has not been enough income from the business to finish the house.  The house still needs a roof, doors, and plaster.  The close location to the sea makes finishing the construction urgent.  The cold nights could affect the health of their two children, who are 9 and 5, because the roof is covered by metal pieces and the door is made of plywood.\r\n\r\nThat is why they are asking the Institution for a loan of 3,100 PEN to help finish their house and keep working in their small restaurant.  They want their children to grow up in a house that gives them real security.\r\n\r\nThey have worked with the Institution five times, and they have paid back their loans punctually.  Therefore, they are considered to be excellent clients.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":372534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy construction materials to make improvements on their house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-08-19T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3100,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3123.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780562}],"funded_date":"2009-08-20T01:11:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":134293,"name":"Margarita","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Margarita pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cManuela de Hoy II\u201d  que esta ubicado en la Comunidad de Camicachi de el distrito de Ilave, Provincia de El Collao, Departamento de Puno, ella tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, estado civil conviviente y madre de 3 hijos y estudio secundaria completa, vive en el sector  Alpacuyo I. \n\nTrabaja con el Movimiento Manuela Ramos hace 3 a\u00f1os con un pr\u00e9stamo inicial de S\/. 300.00 nuevos soles  para la compra de ovinos. \n\nEn este momento ella requiere un pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 1000.00 Nuevos soles, para la compra de un toro para mejorarlo y venderlo en la feria de Ilave.\n\nSu deseo es aumentar su ganado y poder vender a los mayoristas\n\nA ella le gustan las reuniones y los ahorros.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":382235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Para la compra de toro.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-03T02:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1041.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835264}],"funded_date":"2009-09-03T13:28:49Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":138405,"name":"Crimilde Geraldina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Crimilde Geraldina M. nasceu em Magude (Maputo) tem 31 anos de idade \u00e9 separada m\u00e3e de 2 filhos.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his wife and their children in a large extended traditional family in his birth village, part of the Sikasso prefecture (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nMr. Beth\u00e9 has been a trained mechanic for eight years. As a service to his numerous customers who wants to buy spare parts locally to avoid traveling, he also runs a business buying and selling used spare parts. He's very much in demand due to the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, he decided two years ago to join Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso. He's seeking his third individual loan, and all previous loans were repaid without problems. \r\n\r\nHe intends to buy connecting rods, camshafts, pistons, rims, etc. The parts are bought locally and comes from dismantled vehicles, and are sold in his shop inside his garage. With this loan, he foresees turning a monthly profit of XOF 100'000 (ca US$ 200), to be used mostly to bolster his working capital, help with the family expenses, and repay the loan.
