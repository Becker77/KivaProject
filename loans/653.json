They have 15 children who are between 18 and 42 years old. Merlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to buy additional goods for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Merlinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Minda, as she is called by friends, reached only high school and fervently wishes that her children will reach farther than she did. She is married to Ronald, a vendor. They have five children. Two are in high school, another two study in elementary, and the youngest is not yet of school age. They used to live in Pangasinan, but at present the whole family resides in Libertad, Pasay City.\n\nAside from the profits of their tricycle operations which go to their family's needs, Minda focuses on her food stall as another primary source of income. Everyday she prepares breakfast and snacks as part of the menu, serving the customers who are too busy to prepare their own meals or those who stay on the road too long and do not have enough time to go home to eat. Minda has her own space in the community's public market, and she has sold from there for thirteen years now. Ronald helps her with the daily tasks. Every month they are able to earn around $320.\n\nTo help her expand her food stall, Minda is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will use this money to purchase necessary ingredients for cooking, such as cooking oil, coconut, eggs and brown sugar, as well supplies such as spaghetti noodles and macaroni. Minda recognizes the big help the loan represents in her business, as it helps her augment her family's needs with increased profits.\n\nAccording to Minda herself, daily sales become low during the rainy season. Another challenge to her comes as the result of her child's early marriage. This child of hers was not prepared to establish a separate home, and still lives with them. Minda prays that her child and her son-in-law will find a decent job to support themselves. For her other children, she prays that they would fulfill her dream of seeing them graduate from college. Minda wants to see her business grow and have good sales daily. She also dreams of having her own commercial space. \n\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":741337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

A. is from the village of Brgy. Mauan, Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya. He is 50 years old and married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Henry owns and operates a business raising livestock. His main source of income comes from raising breeding pigs. Henry has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nHenry joined ASKI in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 34,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Henry is requesting a loan of 40,000 PHP to purchase additional pigs to raise. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Henry from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from his livestock business to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas.

R. is a married woman who lives in the municipality of Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  vegetable and fruit vending and fish vending. Her husband Leonardo, who is 45 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 2 and 24 years old. Amelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

He is a farmer and also does tailoring and has a butcher business. He has been a farmer  for 25 years. Stephen bought his own land on which he cultivates his crops and this explains how hardworking and determined he is about farming. He has a big volume of customers especially traders from Mbarara which is the neighboring district and also locals buy matooke (banana\/plantain) from his farm in large quantities. With this Kiva loan, he plans to buy good farm tools, seeds, mulch, manure and to hire workers. Though lack of rainfall is a problem in parts of Uganda, the western part of Uganda receives a reasonable amount of rainfall. Ibanda district  is one of the districts found in the western part of the country where Stephen lives and farms.\r\n\r\nAgriculture in Uganda and the entire sub Saharan Africa employs the majority of the population and it's contribution to the the growth domestic product (GDP) is very significant. Governments in Africa including Uganda have  embarked on a campaign to promote agriculture in the region to fight hunger and poverty. The only challenge is climate.

Much like many other rural families, she and her husband fatten up livestock, after starting this business in 2003.  Today, Gulkayir's business has one dairy cow, five sheep, one bull and five goats.  Sales of milk, dairy products and meat allows her to earn about 8,000 som (KGS) per month.  Gulkayir is also involved in craftsmanship in her free time.  She makes pillows and blankets, which also serve as a small income for the family's budget.

The members plan to use the loan for various purposes. Mrs. Sory C. is the village bank president, selected by the members. She is 54 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are laborers while the others are enrolled in the local school.  Her husband, Mr. Soeung ChansE., is a duck breeder. Mrs. Sory C. sells chickens in the local market. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand; she has a lot of customers and increased demand. In order to support this business, Mrs. Sory C. decided to ask for a loan to buy more chickens to sell to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. These borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

This group had the opportunity to attend elementary school, so they communicate well and are approachable in society. They started their own traveling businesses, purchasing items in Managua's oriental market and selling them by going house to house in nearby neighborhoods. Rebeca is a wonderful woman and she says she is grateful to Kiva partner ADIM for not only the loan, but also the ability to improve. She feels that the learning experience that she has gotten by working with ADIM has allowed her to realize how valuable a honorable and hardworking woman is. The women use their loans to buy items wholesale for lower prices and increase their profits. They hope to participate in training workshops to improve their businesses.

She is 48 years old. Amalia is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Amalia owns & operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the local community. Amalia has been running her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Amalia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amalia is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Amalia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her customers place their orders with her and she accepts payments by cash or on credit. The only problem is that many of her customers delay their payments, which hurts her because she is left with little available capital.\r\n<p>\r\nAlyeris stores her merchandise in her room, which makes it uncomfortable. She needs to have a location from where she can sell her products. For this reason, Alyeris will purchase materials such as stone, sand, cement, iron, zinc, and crossbeams so that she can begin construction. Thanks to her previous loans, she has been able to maintain the sales business that she started. With the support of AFODENIC, Alyeris will receive her eleventh loan which will help her continue making improvements in her life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives alone with her daughter and new husband in her own home in a neighborhood in the south of Lima. \r\n\r\nShe runs her own business selling groceries and staples in a store built in the first floor of her house. She has run this business for 16 years. Since then she has attended to her every one of her customers with a lot of friendliness because without them she would not have been able to grow her inventory and her profits. For this reason she opens her store at 6am until late at night. When she leaves to buy merchandise, her daughter is in charge of selling beverages. She always hurries home because they do not like to leave the business closed.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to have her warehouse full of various products.

She is married to a cocoa farmer and has 6 children between the ages of 9 and 25 years old.  Akua and her husband hope to provide their children with a good education and build a home for their family. For the past 25 years, Akua has operated a business selling vegetables and fruit.  Akua also manufactures local soap for washing clothes.  She will use the loan to purchase more vegetables and fruit such as tomatoes, garden eggs (or eggplant), and also buy more ingredients for her soap-making business.\r\n \r\nAkua is currently the leader of the group named 'Joy Trust Bank Group'.

Esther and her husband, Alejandro, are the source of support for their children.  They are both farmers who support each other in the field chores.\r\n\r\nShe has tilled the soil for 27 years.  She has a parcel of land where she has grown hardwood trees, cocoa beans and coffee, products that are typical of the Apurimac River Valley.  During harvest time she needs extra hands to help so she must hire day laborers to get ahead with the harvesting.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys the most about her work is harvesting because that\u2019s when she sees the long months of hard work rewarded in the quality of her fruits.

She lives in a simple home with her 2 children and her long-term partner. Her most difficult challenges were to raise her children after she became single (got divorced from her children's father) and didn't have a husband to help her with the needs in her house, so she had to start working for income and to take care of her children.\n\nShe says that her favorite thing is to take care of her children and to spend time with them at their home.

She has received and successfully repaid three Empowerment Credit loans. She invested these loans in her poultry, restaurant, and bar business. She used the profit from these loans to educate her grandchildren and to increase her capital.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan of 200,000 FRS, she intends to buy fowl for her poultry farm, buy drinks for her bar, and to buy firewood and stock some provisions. She strongly believes that this business will be a success because she has done it for a very long time and has a lot of experience with it. Other reasons for success are that she sells at a moderate price and has enough customers. The site of the business is also very good. Her business activity will be of great help to her community in that it will create an employment opportunity for N. and others, it will make some goods available for people around her, and will also improve people\u2019s eating habits.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds from her business, she will feed and clothe her family and also increase her capital. She prefers a GHAPE loan because of the training she receives, the low interest rates, and also because no collateral security is required before loans are disbursed. The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":869962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fowl, drinks, firewood, red oil, and other provisions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

The profits from the business will be used to increase her welfare.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Of her children, two are out of school and managing their own families while four are studying.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam's business is selling used clothing including bed sheets, curtains and nets. She has done this for 15 years. She transacts her business by moving from one busy location to another to daily markets around her home area. She buys her stock in bales from Kampala once every week and business is good. People like secondhand clothes because they are unique and long lasting unlike new clothes. From one bale, on average Mariam makes a profit of $50 and sometimes more depending on the quality of the products. Mariam intends to use the loan to buy more bed sheets, curtains and nets for sale. Her dream is to one day open up an outlet in the trading centre so that she can sell from one place while she hires someone else to do the walking around with other stock. She believes this will increase her income, hence more profits.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam will share this loan with the other group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":179981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more bed sheets, curtains and nets for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Gayaza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.916667 31.6","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-08-07T14:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":108,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samalie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dezilanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-06T15:39:20Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1612500},{"due_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1612500},{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1612500},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1612500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-07T07:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350080},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:40:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344343},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966457},{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1612500,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1615000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14882657}],"funded_date":"2008-08-23T15:39:20Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:42:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rose Vines","image":111942}},{"id":60170,"name":"Akossiwavi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Ms. Akossiwavi A. was born in Lom\u00e9 on February 1st, 1970.

She resides with her sister and children in Sanoubougou I, a working-class district of Sikasso City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Having lacked the chance to continue with her schooling due to societal reasons, she was soon introduced to income-generating work, notably buying and selling bed sheets, children's clothing, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), embroidered fabrics, etc.  She is in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of women) for the quality of her products.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about doing better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  After two solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area (Association JEKAFO de Sanoubougou II) and two individual loans, all correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.

Kurbon is an energetic man who has been a farmer for 15 years. He is happily married to a hardworking woman who always supports him. She has helped him get ahead in life and has given him 4 children. Like most other people in the zone who depend on the vegetable crop, Kurbon needs to buy agricultural supplies that will allow for the maintenance and production of his crops up to the optimum harvest time. With this purpose Kurbon applied to IMON International for a loan of 3500 Somoni to purchase agricultural supplies like seeds and fertilizer. Kurbon and his beloved family sincerely thank you for your support.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that it is going very well; she works on orders that her customers place in advance.  She attends to them with characteristic friendliness and charisma.  With this loan of 1,500 soles nuevos she will buy meters of fabric in different types and colors, tools such as scissors, thread on large spools in a variety of colors, needles for hand and machine sewing, pins and buttons.  Today she feels like a very accomplished woman, with a desire to continue to reach for her goals and make her other dreams a reality.

She lives in her own house with her husband William, who is 37.  They both wish to succeed in life.\r\n<p>\r\nAntonia engages in the manufacture of bricks.  Her oven is located on the outskirts of the city of Juliaca.  Together with her husband, she wakes up early in the morning to begin kneading and molding the clay before letting it dry for ten days prior to baking in the oven.  What she enjoys most about her job is selling the bricks, which is the point in which she feels rewarded for her work.  Antonio has been in this business for ten years and believes the most difficult part is dealing with the weather.  Many times while working in the sun, the work becomes more difficult.  When it rains, she is not able to mold the bricks correctly.  Nevertheless, she continues to work hard in order to improve her quality of life.  In the future, she would like to open a grocery store in her house because there are few in her neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third loan that she has accessed from MFP.  Just like her previous loans, Antonia wants to make her payments on time and with little difficulty.  She is highly respected by her Communal Bank because she is one of the most active and committed members.  With her loan of 3000 soles, she plans to buy new molds for making roofing bricks since these are the type that are most requested.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":476166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase molds for making bricks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124517},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960258},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993102},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717888},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751563},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934031}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T23:26:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":175311,"name":"Folorunsho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Folorunsho lives in Lagos State, Nigeria.

Her eldest son is 26 and the youngest is 8 years old; all her children are in education. She began selling Primus beer and Fanta 26 years ago. She began the business with funds that she received from her father, around 50$. She showcases her wares from her home and sometimes on the road. This loan will enable her to boost her revenues by purchasing a 1100$ plot of land through cumulative loans. The main obstacle is that she sells her goods in local currency (Congolese franc). However this currency is not stable and is subject to high inflation and often loses value against the dollar; all Congolese merchants fear the franc and keep their transactions in dollars. She would like to see her children finish school and double her stock of Primus and Fanta from 40 to 70 cases. Faida Jos\u00e9phine would like to thank  Hekima for its actions that help poor citizens who are excluded from the mainstream banking system.

Tinungan, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a general store business.  Madalena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Madalena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to buy additional stock for the general store so that she could continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Madalena C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and expansion of her business. Mercy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She buys it wholesale and then sells it at different work sites. She does this in the afternoons independently, not from an authorized cart. In a cardboard box she places different kinds of candy, and in a basket she puts cookies and chocolate. \r\n\r\nHer other job is making lunches. She gets up very early in the morning to prepare the food and then takes the plastic containers to different work sites where busy workers are building houses, buildings, schools etc. She sells 20-30 lunches daily at a set time. This is an advantage for the men, and profitable for Julia.\r\n\r\nNow Julia wishes to buy ingredients for making the food. She is seeking a loan to buy oil in cans, potatoes at wholesale prices, rice in sacks, and other products. She doesn't have any special plans for the future, only to be in work and able to pay for her children's needs. Her only wish is for her children to have regular meals, health, clothing, and an education.\r\n\r\nJulia is grateful for the support that is offered and promises to make the loan repayments in a disciplined manner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":869994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy products wholesale, such as oil and potatoes, for her lunch-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cachimayo - Anta - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-09-17T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":70.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":76.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":79.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.64},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.48,"local_amount":70.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":80.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232748100},{"amount":30.64,"local_amount":73.54,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238552175},{"amount":31.86,"local_amount":76.47,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":86.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244510982},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":79.24,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":89.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250718433}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:45Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:26:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":339671,"name":"Oscar Danilo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Oscar Danilo se dedica a brindar el servicio de tornero.

He lives in Senegal. He is married and the father of four children, whose ages range from one to seven years. He has been active since 1992 teaching the Koran in the area where he lives. What interests him the most is the knowledge that he imparts to the children. He has been a member of his UIMCEC branch since October 2003.

Sergey\u2019s dream is to open family computer store\/club. <p>\r\n\r\nBefore Sergey started his business, he used to work at a factory adjusting welding equipment. When the factory staff was reduced, Sergey lost his job. He was forced to find another source of income for the family with two little kids. That\u2019s how he ended up at a car repair shop working with a car flattener. In 1994 Sergey decided to start a small business of his own, selling dishware, leather wallets, perfume and souvenirs. The loans he received in \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d helped him reinforce his trade activities, providing necessary resources for his small business. Sergey is very consistent and balanced, he has a good sense of management. That\u2019s why he has succeeded to manage all loans without any delinquencies. <p>\r\n\r\nSergey is applying for a loan to get sufficient capital to increase his inventory and gain extra profits. It will not only help him have enough to maintain his family and cover the increasing demand this Christmas season, but also give their family computer business a good start. In the country where most families still don\u2019t have computers at home and many people go to computer clubs to access internet, Sergey and his son can open a client-friendly internet caf\u00e9 that would provide high quality service to the community. They are planning to rent a facility, do all the necessary remodelling and purchase desktop computers and supplementary furniture.

The general store brings her a profit of about 200 USD\/month. Besides, her husband also breeds animals. This time, she wants to borrow 550 USD to invest more in her general store. Her total income is approximately 275 USD\/month. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ecbnh Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3ng 47 tu\u1ed5i hi\u1ec7n \u0111ang l\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 c\u1ee7a c\u1ee7a h\u00e0ng t\u1ea1p ho\u00e1 nh\u1ecf.

For the past seven years, she has been working as a custodian at the Agrarian University. She currently lives with her mother, and is requesting her eighth loan to buy a plot of land on which she can build her own home in the future. She plans to continue to take out loans so that, little by little, she can make her dream of building her own home come true. Someday, she will have a family of her own, and she would like her family to have its own home and access to basic services.

Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because her parents' life situation is not good; in addition, she is a student.\r\n\r\nZulfa has been running a medical shop since 1997. She works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Zulfa currently earns about 110USD a month from her business.

Zulfa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":271089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing medicine in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Zulfa J.

The main feature of their houses is that they are built largely of adobe and have a single floor. The communal bank is composed of responsible, cheerful members who support one another. The bank is guided by a board of directors: the president is Julia, a seamstress who makes skirts for women; the treasurer is Nancy, who sells cakes and pastries; and the secretary is Jimena, who sells different devices. The rest of the members engage in various activities including sewing, manufacturing sports equipment, weaving handmade blankets and sweaters from vicu\u00f1a and alpaca wool, selling clothing, running small or neighborhood stores, selling meat, and selling gifts.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow 10 times in CCT\u2019s cooperative.

Her business lets her earn an average profit of 15,000 PHP per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of 12,000 PHP. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business to buy assorted cosmetics, branded clothes and shoes.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will grow into a franchise store so that she can gain big profits and experience a good status in life. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She sells such items as: lettuce, coriander, huacatay (native Peruvian herb related to marigold and tarragon) and parsley.  She tells us that she does not own her own fields so she must lease land to grow her products.  Once she harvests, she sends it to market vendors in Huancaro\u2019s market to sell.  She has been in this line of work for 7 years now and has done well thanks to the effort she puts into her work.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that she has regular customers that order her vegetables because her products are of good quality and her customers are satisfied.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to see her children become professionals.\r\n\r\nHonorata needs funds to buy seed like: lettuce, parsley and huacatay;

They have one son from their relationship, named Jharlim and he is 3 years old. They live together in a house which they own in the community of Villa Quintiarina, an annex to the district of Quimbiri. When Yoel was still an adolescent he worked his parents' land. But 5 years ago he managed to purchase a parcel of land measuring 6 hectares where he cultivates cocoa and coffee. The key to his success has been his creativity and his eagerness to work. His plants benefit from being cared for in a technical manner. He received training from the Agricultural Engineers periodically. The product in greatest demand is the cocoa beans, given the quality of the product that he offers and the income earned from these grains is good. He usually works alone but during the harvest he hires farm hands to help him advance in the harvest quickly. His plan for the future is to keep expanding his agricultural production to be able to satisfy his clients' demands. He will be able to improve the quality of his life. This is his first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he knows that his support will be a great help in the development of his work. With the loan that he requests he will hire farmhands to help him with the harvest and to help him combat against plagues.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":760468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire farmhands to help him combat against plagues.

When she returns home, she displays her products on the path alongside the house and starts her sales.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this line of work for five years and she does it alone.

However, the only thing she doesn\u2019t like about her work is having to move her products daily because the sales take place at the house of her in-laws and she has to place them in the space her in-laws gave her.\r\n\r\nThis is Juana Patricia\u2019s 10th loan with MFP.

Battulga is 47 years old and lives with his wife and four children in a house in Uvs province, Mongolia. His oldest son and daughter are both  university students and his youngest son and daughter attend local secondary schools. \r\n<p>\r\nBattulga manages a meat and animal fat oil trading business in his town with the help of his wife. He sells a variety of meats and fat oil which he makes from the internal organs of animals. Animal fat oil is a popular product among residents who live far from the market and can't make frequent trips into town. They use it to make everyday foods such as buns and to fry potatoes.

She makes a living cultivating bananas and coffee. She wakes up very early in the morning every day to work on her crops, knowing that her profits will depend heavily on the quality of her products. What she most likes about her job is harvesting her lands, since she gets to see all of her hard work bearing fruit. She has been doing this activity for 20 years, and considers disinfecting her crops with chemical products as the most difficult task, since she runs the risk of getting sick. With time she hopes to plant all of her lands and increase her income.
