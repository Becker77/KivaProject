With all this depression, she almost gave up when her pig, which was her only source of income at that time, gave birth and ate up all her piglets. This affected her because she had spent money on crossing the pig and on pig feed which she was expecting to recover after selling the piglets. She has taken GHAPE loan three times before and paid back. She intends to do poultry farming now (buying day-old chicks and raring them) and petit business.  She feels that this business will be a success because they have been trained by GHAPE on how to succeed on these aspects.

She says she bakes at most 1000 loaves of bread in a day. <P>\r\n\r\nYaa needs the loan to buy more bags of flour, sugar, margarine, milk, and firewood, etc. to restock her inventory.

Mirhalim is 51 years old. He has experience of 2 years preparing and selling cookies and different kinds of sweets. He began working with a friend delivering bread.

The business is successful, generating stable, considerable income, allowing Mirhalim to support his family. Mirhalim wants the Kiva loan to be able to buy products and necessary equipment for the preparation of the extra cookies, because at this time he is only supplying the part of the demand.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a far cry from, and in contrast to, when she was a housewife when odds seemed to be stacked against her. With a stable business running, she also rationalized that eking out side-profits constructing and running a rental and retail shop business where she sells blankets and mattresses, would not be a bad proposition.\r\n\r\nP. has managed to reconcile all her duties well and her businesses are all driving a roaring trade.

I. is from the village of Centro 2.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for more than seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide her service. Marites is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

","en":"Doris is 43 years old and lives in her own home with her husband Pedro, age 45, who works as a mason.  Her grown son works and helps with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nEight years ago, Doris and her husband started a furniture manufacturing business.  Since then, she spends most of her time sewing.  On the weekends when her husband is resting, they both will spend some time assembling furniture.  Doris is very satisfied because their business has not experienced any losses since their work is done according to order.  This business has enabled her to do a better job of covering the household expenses.  However, Doris dislikes those instances when her customers delay the delivery of completed furniture because the pieces collect dirt since she lives in a dusty area.  She says that she has several established customers who buy merchandise from her regularly because they know that her furniture will be comfortable and of good quality.  In addition, Doris is an enterprising woman who has future plans to expand her business and produce a higher quantity of furniture.  The money she requested will be invested in the purchase of materials (fabric and wood) that she is lacking so that she can complete an outstanding order and hopefully increase her earnings.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Doris promises to complete her payments on time because she does not want to look bad in the eyes of those responsible for making this loan possible so that she could continue working and moving forward."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":715088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabric & wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":121.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.06},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.38,"local_amount":121.02,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":125.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327739},{"amount":95.93,"local_amount":255.8,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":265.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269943},{"amount":32.13,"local_amount":85.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":88.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718637},{"amount":71.76,"local_amount":191.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":198.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851430},{"amount":54.8,"local_amount":146.15,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":151.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666717}],"funded_date":"2011-02-21T12:55:09Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":278698,"name":"Sinat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sinat T. is 30 years old and her husband, Mr. Chantha Chhin is 39 years old.

He is a private entrepreneur who sells car spare parts. Sunnatullo is very disciplined. One of his strong characteristics is his ability to listen and persuade, which helps him in his work with customers. Sunnatullo has been in the market for 12 years. His main goal is to provide his family with a decent life and stable future. He has always tried to achieve financial and economic independence and make a career. Sunnatullo is hoping to see his business flourish and succeed. Sunnatullo believes this loan of 8,000 TJS will allow him to purchase spare car parts for his business and will be one of the steps towards his goal. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fee. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a farmer who owns a plot of land she uses to cultivate rice. Aside from this plantation, she makes thatch to cover the roofs. Although she tries to work hard, she still earns less income than she needs to support her family's living conditions.

V., 41, lives in San Juan Opico, La Libertad department, with her three minor children, who are in school.  For the last 9 years, Patricia has sold prepared, typical meals, such as: tamales, enchiladas and fried yucca.  Her eatery is strategically located in San Juan Opico's market which receives many visitors daily.  She also has regular customers who work in the market itself selling different products.  Patricia needs financing to buy cooking oil, rice, corn, vegetables, among other ingredients, which are the most used in her meals.  Patricia has always known how to get ahead on her own, working hard to provide her children with everything they need, because Patricia is a single mother.

business ventures:   farming, rice retailer and food vending businesses. She lives in Catlagan, Bgry. Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\n By working hard at her farming, rice retailing and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,000. Elizabeth is now borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase a transport vehicle.  This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Elizabeth aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His in-laws pulled him into the business just as the technology was changing and the industry was growing.  Mark worked for the family business for a while and then started another business with a friend.  When the economy tanked, he decided to reduce his overhead costs and open his own business, Floppy Hat Pool Service.  He has had some of the same customers the entire time he has been in the pool business.  At the moment he has 70 different clients that he goes to regularly and has had as many as 108.  He is the only employee, so his 70 clients keep him extremely busy.  He is looking to hire another employee starting in April because he is expecting to have more customers in the high season.\r\n\r\nMark found out about ACCION Texas-Louisiana through a small business development advisor who had helped him with business issues in the past.  Mark had set a hard date to open Floppy Hat, whether he had a loan or not.  When he got in touch with ACCION, he told his loan officer that he was working with a short time frame.  He was grateful for the guidance from ACCION and was ecstatic when he received the loan before opening the business.  The loan gave him the working capital to allow Floppy Hat to take off.  Mark was able to go straight to his distributor and buy products to sell to his clients.  He was also able to pay for basic operating costs such as his insurance and worker\u2019s compensation.  \r\n\r\nMark describes himself as a workaholic, but hopes to have someone working under him in the future.  He wants to have more time for other things.  He would love to be able to spend more time with his four grandchildren and to play his trombone.  \r\n\r\nMark believes it is important to watch overhead costs and to only spend the money that the small business has.  Mark\u2019s motto is that \u201chard work never hurt anybody.\u201d  He enjoys working hard and seeing how all that hard work pays off.

":"Joaquina B. B. is 27 and earns her monetary income by weaving beautiful Mayan huipiles, the traditional blouse the women wear in the mountains of western Guatemala. Weaving each huipil takes about two months' work, and she can sell one for almost US$200, making a profit of about US$150.

After the rainy season, the crops are stored for a while to increase their market value, before being sold at the grand market in Koutiala and in the surrounding villages, retail (often wholesale) and for cash, to a clientele usually coming from the larger cities.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the sale of their production, the members of the Benkadi 3 group count on turning a profit of XOF 65'000 (ca US$ 140) each, to be used to repay the loan and to pay for the daily expenses of their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":331809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy peanut seed, small material, and fertilizers for the fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Machitan Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Madou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Amadou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami  Coulibaly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karia Yssouf ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata Karim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moyama Sotigui ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":540000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":540000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":118081,"name":"Bernie Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bernie Joy T. is from the town of Misom, Baliangao Misamis Occidental.

Each woman works in a different type of commercial business like seamstress, food sales, refreshments, transportation services, construction, and the sale of soft drinks. In the field of goods and services, competition is high and in particular for those members who do not have much merchandise.  They cannot compete with the bigger stores that can lower their costs and still remain competitive.  However, the bank's members have a lot of experience and are motivated by a desire to help their families get ahead.  \r\n\r\nThe loan is to increase merchandise.  For example, to purchase supplies and materials that can help them get better working capital so they can stand up to the competition.  This is the bank members first loan cycle, so they do not have much experience in solidarity groups, but they do have a great desire to grow.  This desire pushes them to get ahead to proviD. their families with a higher quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, KI.

Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a canteen and a peanut-butter business. Her husband, Rolando N., who is 34 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living. They have two children who are 6 and 9 years old and are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nMarilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired after something better for her family. With the help of her past eleven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her twelfth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her peanut-butter business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marilou N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a community member who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nRaquel joined ASKI in 2011 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP to purchase items to expand her store inventory. This is the first loan taken out by Raquel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":746330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

house. This was due to the difficult economic situation in which she found herself at that time. Her husband was without a job, and it was through her business that she was able to feed and educate her 2 children. She now has a small store selling basic goods, which is the fruit of all those years of work. She offers a variety of basic products, such as basic grains, dairy products, breads and pastries, and non-perishable foods. She spends her whole day working in her business, and she is satisfied with what she has achieved. She has plans to expand the space of the business and also to offer new products, with the goal that her customers can have a better variety of products, brands, and prices. Currently, she wishes to increase the inventory of products that she has, because getting them on credit from the wholesaler is a limiting factor for her. She wants to buy in cash in order to offer her clients better service by having everything they need. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>Do\u00f1a Kenia hace 8 a\u00f1os inici\u00f3 su peque\u00f1o negocio vendiendo en la acera de su humilde vivienda golosinas como galletas, caramelos y helados, esto surge debido a la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en la que se encontraba en ese momento, ya que su esposo hab\u00eda quedado sin empleo y fue de esta manera como logr\u00f3 alimentar y educar a sus 2 hijos. \r\n\r\nHoy en d\u00eda tiene una pulper\u00eda fruto del trabajo de todos estos a\u00f1os, en la cual ofrece una variedad de productos alimenticios de consumo b\u00e1sicos como granos b\u00e1sicos, l\u00e1cteos, poter\u00eda, perecederos, entre otros.

The skill involved in creating \u201cCanang\u201d and \u201cBanten\u201d (arrangements out of leaves and flowers used as offerings by Hindu worshippers) was instilled in her when she was a young teenager. The skill was passed on by her parents, who used to sell these items in the market. <p>Komang takes orders for large religious ceremonies such as \u201cGalungan\u201d and \u201cKuningan\u201d (which celebrate the arrival of gods and ancestral spirits on earth to dwell in the homes of descendants).  Similarly she caters for other events and festivals such as \u201cOdalan\u201d, \u201cOtonan\u201d, and \u201cNgaben\u201d. Fulfilling these types of orders requires substantial investment. <p>To ensure that the process of making these prayer offerings is a smooth one, Komang recruits several of her neighbors to get involved, especially if the orders are large and she is running short of time. Komang pays a daily stipend to the people who help her. <p>Komang has big hopes for the upcoming loan from DINARI foundation (channeled via her village\u2019s central institution).  It will support her efforts by ensuring she has necessary and adequate materials needed to make these prayer offerings. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nKomang Ita Maharani itulah nama lengkap ibu dari  dua orang anak ini. Ketrampilan membuat Canang dan Banten  ( sarana persembahyangan umat Hindu ) sudah ditekuninya sejak masih remaja. Ketrampilan ini didapatkan dari orang tuanya yang  juga penjual canang sari dan banten dipasar.\r\n<p>Komang juga melayani pesanan untuk sarana persembahyangan besar seperti hari raya Galungan dan Kuningan ataupun acara ritual lainnya yaitu Odalan, Otonan dan Ngaben. Untuk memenuhi pesanan ini dibutuhkan biaya yang cukup banyak \r\n<p>Untuk memperlancar proses pembuatan canangsari dan banten, Komang mengajak beberapa orang tetangganya untuk ikut terlibat dalam proses pembuatannya terutama jika ada pesanan yang jumlahnya sangat banyak dan kejar waktu. Komang juga harus membayar orang yang ikut bekerja ditempatnya dengan hitungan harian.\r\n<p>Dengan adanya pinjaman modal dari yayasan Dinari yang disalurkan melalui lembaga  di desanya, besar harapan Komang untuk mendapat pinjaman modal tersebut karena modal ini sangat dibutuhkannya untuk menunjang sarana dalam mencukupi kebutuhan bahan-baku yang diperlukan untuk membuat banten dan canang

","en":"Luis just turned 38 years old and has lived with his partner for nearly 11 years, which is also the age of his oldest son.  Five months ago his second son, named Samuel, was born.  When he and his partner married they lived in his mother-in-law\u2019s house, however two years ago they moved to their own home.  From a young age, he has dedicated himself to working the land, having inherited a perserverance for this type of work from his parents.  Currently, he plants peas and corn which bring good prices during this season.  Luis sells by the bushel, in other words, sacks weighing more than 60 kilos in which he can fit exactly 200 ears of corn.  Each sack sells for approximately 80.00 Peruvian soles.  Market prices fluctuate, however, which can be difficult.  He has also never ceased planting potatoes and, this season, will be sowing from a seed that develops in only three months.  Unlike other seeds, it is very resistant to the rainy season and to plagues, which is why he doesn\u2019t need to invest much into remedies for these types of problems.  Luis has buyers in the coastal cities, which means his crops have an assured sale.  This is his fourth loan with MFP.  He was recently sworn in as the president of his cooperative bank, and he promises to fulfill the job well and work to ensure that all members pay their loan installments responsibly.  The funds he requests are for the purchase of insecticides to fumigate his corn crop against a worm they call \u201cshiuri\u201d, which is white and 2 cm. long.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

agricultural work for many years. She is married to a man who has the same kind of job. Now they are blessed with two lovely children. Neither attends school. Mrs. Tep is busy with her work because, besides farming for six months, she spends her time making baskets and other objects, weaving together thin, bendable strips of wood to sell to local tradesmen. With the coming rainfall, Mrs. Tep has some concerns about her rice crop because it is not growing well, due to the lack of fertilizers to spread on her farmland. To solve the problem, Mrs. Tep is requesting some funds from Kiva to purchase mineral fertilizers for her crop. With the remaining money, she wishes to buy some pigs for breeding behind her house.

She buys wholesale on-site with farmers attending the market, and then sells retail to foreigners and stallkeepers in the city.  \r\nShe plans on using this loan to generate monthly profits of 100,000 CFA francs, which will go largely towards contributing to the family\u2019s expenses and paying interest on her loan, with any remaining funds being re-invested into her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":941263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase yams","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283268},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424779},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140044},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757018},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251776},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410782},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448954},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502722},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268401},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":16008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498818}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T16:45:55Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Rosendale","image":754499}},{"id":377130,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"David tiene una comercializadora de prendas de vestir y trabaja en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su se\u00f1ora madre dese hace 14 meses;

Albaida raises and sells chickens, a business that produces good profits, in the city of Pucallpa.  Albaida's business runs in a 45-day cycle.  She purchases her chicks, feeds them well, and is ready to sell them after 1.5 months when they are fully grown.

Poblacion, Diadi, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 50 years old. With the support of her parents, she graduated with the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. After this, she married to Francisco C. and they are blessed with five children.  Being responsible parents is their great obligation to support their children for their financial needs and moral support. \r\nHer husband is the one who manages their farm lots by planting variety of vegetables while Wilma engaged in selling herbal bath soaps and smoked fish in their village to help her husband in gaining income. With a small capital, she used to acquire her products from Solano Public Market and sell them to their village.

(vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70 kilometers from Dakar. The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities. Today, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with Kiva partner, UIMCEC. Groups of five are financed through ten-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments. Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. F., the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \r\n<br>Fatou F. is the young head of group No. 11. She is among the many women who sell vegetables in the market of Grand Thies, a neighborhood in the middle of the city. She sells cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes and other vegetables, depending on the season. She explains that she started out on her own in the market, and likes the daily interactions with the other vendors.\r\n<br>Group No. 11's other members are: Fatou Diarra G. and Aissatou L., who both sell lettuce and tomatoes; Sagar B., who sells fresh fish; and Awa F., who sells used clothing. Each of the group's members receives 100,000 XOF to bolster their activities.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":466130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To bolster her small business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T14:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Diarra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sagar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168532},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007494},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036566},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759124},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790638},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971077},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708341},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-22T09:23:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922412},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188915},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484359}],"funded_date":"2010-01-12T04:46:36Z","paid_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":171678,"name":"Mam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Almost all of the people who live in Kampong Chhnang province earn a living as a basket weaver.

She is a farmer in a small southern village called Aravan.  This has become a lifetime occupation for her, since she has been farming and staying close to nature from early childhood.

Her children are all dependent on this  family income, including the youngest one, who is 10 years old. Khaticha also has to take care of arranging a wedding ceremony for her oldest daughter. \r\n\r\nKhaticha\u2019s group looks forward to having this loan and maintaining each one\u2019s own business.

She is 63 years old and married with 6 children, all of whom are now married. She takes care of a grandchild, age 15, and her late sister's child, also age 15. She has been running a tailoring business since 1997 and makes chair backs and seat covers. These products are sold to the local market in Zimbabwe and also to ladies who resell mainly in South Africa. In addition, she owns a grinding mill in Banket (Zimbabwe) where she grinds maize for mealie meal used to cook the country\u2019s staple food. Her other income comes from a room she is letting at her house.

It is located in the Sialupe Baca rural area, approximately one hour from the department of Lambayeque.  The main activities in this area are agriculture, livestock farming and crafts.\r\n\r\nIsabel sells \"chicha de jora\" (a drink made with fermented ground maize and other ingredients).  She makes it at home and lets it ferment in ceramic pots.  She has been in business for 10 years and uses a recipe passed down through generations in the area.  She sells to customers who know her and earns an income to cover her daily household expenses.
