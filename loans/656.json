It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

de su localidad y que todav\u00eda preservan sus ra\u00edces ya que la mayor\u00eda de la personas hablan el dialecto mazahua y visten con faldones de la cultura mazahua. Ella desde hace mas de 8 a\u00f1os se dedica a cultivar aguacate dice que su esposo fue el que emprendi\u00f3 el negocio para tener un poco mas de ganancias ya que con lo que ganad de alba\u00f1il no le alcanzaba para mantener a su familia y por eso empez\u00f3 hacer el huerto de aguacates. Platica Cris como de cari\u00f1o le dicen en su casa en cuando no hay fruto hace artesan\u00eda de Ocoshal ya que la materia prima la sacan de las palmitas secas del encino. Ella quiere un pr\u00e9stamo para el mantenimiento de su huerto ya que comprara insumos como abonos org\u00e1nicos, calidra  para eliminar las plagas y ella quisiera comprar una bomba de agua para trasladar el agua hasta el huerto ya que tienen que contratar animales para que le suban el agua al cerro para regar los arboles. Esta muy contenta por que gracias a los cr\u00e9ditos que  ha obtenido atravez de la financiera le han servido porque ha comprado insumos de mejor calidad y as\u00ed puede ofrecerle a sus clientes un fruto de mejor calidad y dice que as\u00ed poco a poco se ha abierto mercado en diferentes municipios de su estado y eso la tiene muy contenta por que quiere decir que los cr\u00e9ditos le sirven de mucho. La meta que tiene do\u00f1a Crisanta es seguir haciendo crecer el negocio y comprar una camioneta de uso para facilitar el transporte del aguacate ya que cuando van a venderlo tienen que agar flete.\n\n\n","en":"\r\nCrisanta, 28, is married to Benito who is a bricklayer and they have three children two of which attend school.  She says that in her community most residents make ocoshal crafts  which are characteristic of her location and which still maintain their roots since most people speak the Mazahua dialect and wear traditional Mazahua skirts.\r\n\r\nShe says that she\u2019s been an avocado farmer for more than 8 years.  She says that it was her husband who started the business to earn a bit more profits since what he earned as a bricklayer did not suffice to support the family so he started to make an avocado orchard.\r\n\r\nCris, which is what she\u2019s affectionately called at home, relates that when there is no fruit she makes Ocoshal crafts since the raw materials for it are extracted from dry oak palm fronds.  She wants a loan for crop maintenance since she will buy farm supplies like organic manure, Calidra [brand of hydrated lime powder] to eradicate infestations; she\u2019d also like to buy a water pump to pump water to the orchard since she now has to rely on animals to carry water up the hill to water the trees.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because thanks to the loans she\u2019s gotten from the lending organization she\u2019s been able to buy better quality supplies so that she can offer her customers better quality fruit in the future.  She says that little by little this way she\u2019s been opening up markets for herself in various municipalities in her state and this makes her very happy because she wants to say that the loans are very useful for her.  Crisanta\u2019s goal is to continue to make her business grow and to buy a pick-up truck to facilitate transport of the avocadoes since they currently have to pay transportation costs when they want to go sell them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":964590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farm supplies and a water pump.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T19:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Crisanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":895.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":938.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":955.97},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":973.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":991.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1010.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1029.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1048.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1068.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1088.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.93,"local_amount":1833.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193886},{"amount":211.83,"local_amount":2921.77,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330242},{"amount":73.26,"local_amount":1010.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044260},{"amount":228.09,"local_amount":3146.13,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656455},{"amount":78.89,"local_amount":1088.07,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317171}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T20:42:05Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T17:04:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":380871,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca is 24 years old, married, and has one child who is two and a half years old.

time ago, Eleuterio worked as a truck driver, but downsizing in his company resulted in him being fired. This left him and his family without money to survive. With a lot of effort and with help from relatives, in 1991 Eleuterio and his family opened a general store, and little by little they began to increase their inventory and clientele. Thanks to the attitude of all his family, the business has become well known among the people who live in Sabinas.<P>\r\nHowever, like all businesses, this one has good times and bad times. Recently, they had many expenses, and so the store was left with a very low inventory. This is why they are requesting a loan of US $475, to be paid in 6 months, to be able to buy merchandise to have a better variety of products. With your help, Eleuterio and his family will be able to succeed.\r\n\r\n<P><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHace tiempo, Eleuterio trabaj\u00f3 como chofer de camiones de carga, pero un reajuste en su empresa, hizo que lo despidieran, dej\u00e1ndolo a \u00e9l y su familia sin dinero para sobrevivir, y con mucho esfuerzo y la ayuda de sus familiares en 1991 Eleuterio y su familia comenzaron a vender productos de abarrotes, y as\u00ed poco a poco comenzaron a crecer el repertorio de sus productos, y haci\u00e9ndose de clientela.

He has been dedicated to the craft of carpentry for 30 years.  He says that most recently finding work is difficult because raw materials, like wood, are hard to find.  A high percentage of what he makes is made with a combination of wood and metal.  His specialties are kitchen furniture, baby cribs, beds ect.  Some of his clients are furniture retailers in the cities of Tobati, Caacupe, and Paraguari.   The loans he obtained from the Paraguaya Foundation were invested in the purchase of wood, and metal support rods along with other manual tools.  He is in the planning stage of opening a repair shop with his son, and with this newest loan it will permit him to purchase the tools he needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":220600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of specialty woods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caacupe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.383333 -57.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-11-12T02:40:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2875000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":958333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":958333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":958333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":958333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-20T20:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":971052.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5318671},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":958333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":971052.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937271},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":958333.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":971052.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860845}],"funded_date":"2008-11-12T12:53:54Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T12:44:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"James Lombardo","image":66911}},{"id":76797,"name":"Bunthoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Bunthoeun S. is a 41-year-old widow with six children who all live in Thorm Ney village in Takeo Province.

She is dedicated to the selling of notebooks, mechanical pencils, books, etc.  She has a bookstore in her home which has given her the money necessary for living expenses.  She rapidly sells products, and she is always ready to receive her customers with a smile on her face.  Zenaida enjoys selling and knows that the more she does the better her income will be, but it is very difficult and tiring to remain inside her bookstore for the entire day as she cannot go out and about with the liberty that she would desire.  With the two years of experience that she has in this line of work, she has decided to grow her business and hopes in the near future to have a larger bookstore.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third loan that Zenaida has taken with MFP, and she always saves the money from her sales to be able to make her payments on time.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Pinotepa Nacional Oaxaca.  It is comprised of 14 members.  They have been working for one year (three cycles) with loans that Fundacion Realidad offers.  All of the members make and sell products like groceries, tamales, soft drink, ice cream, tortilla chips, clothes, perfume, shoes by catalog, notions, lingerie, handmade corn tortillas, tacos, bulk corn, and fresh fish.  Due to the geographic region they are located in, these types of products are in good demand in the area.  As a consequence, their income is very good and acceptable, according to Alicia D. T..  She is a 71 year old member who joined with her daughter, Rosario.  Currently she is not in the group because she moved.  They were the ones that founded the group by inviting neighbors to join.\r\n\r\nAlicia comments that the loan received from the institution has really helped all of the members.  It gives them a means to work and contribute income to their families.  It really helps now that the country\u2019s economy is in crisis, and their husbands incomes do not cover the expenses of the children going to school. \r\n\r\nThey will use the loan they are asking for to make and buy products to sell like corn, wood, plastic bags, fresh meat, dried chilies to prepare mole, groceries, soft drinks, shipping charges for those who buy articles by catalog, rent for boats, and gasoline for those who sell fresh fish.\r\n\r\nThey hope that the Realidad Foundation will continue to offer financial services. They are dependent upon them to keep working and to have a business in the future that generates income and a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

","en":"Born in 1977 in Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin, Raoufath O. has lived for around ten years in the Agbodj\u00e8do district of Cotonou. Raoufath is married to Latifou GBADAMASSI, a printer, and has three children, all of whom are at school. Raoufath lives alone with her children and provides for their various needs herself. She has never been to school. She has for almost seven years been running a business selling fabrics and beauty products on a door-to-door basis. She gets her supplies in Dantokpa, B\u00e9nin's international market, and in Lom\u00e9 in Togo. Raoufath has benefited in the past from two loans from ALID\u00e9 and repaid them correctly. Today, she is applying for a third loan with a view to increasing the level of her activity and to being able to respond better to her customers' demands. Indirectly this would allow her to make more money and improve her life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":513022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fabric","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raoufath ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":15832.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653323},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15832.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835530},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":15832.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575927},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":15832.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954441},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15832.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056099},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":31665.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347633},{"amount":39,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":18999.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482699},{"amount":37.72,"local_amount":17411,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":18377.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617530},{"amount":0.19,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":93.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360947},{"amount":20.59,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10027.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779642}],"funded_date":"2010-03-26T20:10:46Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":192360,"name":"Penh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Penh S. is 53 years old and he lives in Angk village in Kandal province.

He is married to Josephina B., a housewife, and is father to their children. By the grace of God, Eligio has managed to support his children's schooling. At this time, he is working hard to send his children all the way through college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Eligio, as he himself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nEligio operates their jeepney service, which is basically used for public transportation.  He is also a farmer who grows, tends and harvests his own crop from his land. He mostly grows seasonal fruits that are native to the Philippines, like pineapples, which are grown mostly in the south region of Luzon. Also in his product inventory are garlic and onions, tomatoes and other staples for simple cooking recipes. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a small income of around Php400 every day on his jeepney operation.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a Php9,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy fertilizers, seedlings and other farming needs for the crop. He will also use part of this loan to pay for the cost of renewing the registration of his jeepney. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n \r\nEligio dreams to be able to give his children a good and high quality education through all his hard work in his business. He faithfully meets with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":714514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"For the renewal of the registration for his jeepney, and for planting materials for his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-18T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eligio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814263},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256828},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123521},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194820}],"funded_date":"2011-02-18T02:32:51Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":278406,"name":"Sara Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She and her husband have three beautiful children she adores.  She and her family currently live in her husband's parents' home.  They generously offered her a space for her business so they can all get ahead as a family.  Cecilia has a small grocery store in which she sells necessities such as groceries, rice, sugar, milk, and canned goods, among other things.  She has had her business for eight years and those years have been full of constant struggle and perseverance.  She got the idea to start this business because there is a construction project going on in her city to transport gas in tubes that pass through different cities in the south of Peru.  Because of this, there have been many people working on the project who needed to buy necessities and that is why she decided to set up this business.  She was also influenced by the fact that there isn't another grocery store near her house.\r\n\r\nCecilia has worked very hard to get ahead; before starting her business, she worked as a maid, then she worked in agriculture.  As far as her husband is concerned, he managed to get work in the gas transport project as a laborer.  What's more, from that moment they put money aside to start a business and that business is the one Cecilia currently has.

With the current loan, he intends to buy piston rods, camshafts, pistons, rims, etc.  The merchandise (spare parts) comes from automobiles disassembled locally and is resold in a store located within his garage. \r\n\r\nHe envisions using this loan to realize a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment his working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in his business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":322168,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy used spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243024},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112634},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873538},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152085},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101665.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021250}],"funded_date":"2009-06-15T03:25:50Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":113677,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luz tiene 48 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo, quien es trabajador dependiente, y con sus 2 hijas quienes la ayudan mucho en su negocio.

Education is a treasure that once possessed, cannot be stolen or given away, and when used wisely, can open a whole new world for just about anyone whether they started from poverty or wealth. Gloria P. who lives in the village of Brgy. Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental also believes that education is the one thing she can give her children to prepare them to rise above their situation and improve their lives.\r\n\r\n<p>Gloria is 50 years old and married to Fernando P. who presently owns and manages a fishing business. They have three children, two of whom are already gainfully employed, and a younger daughter who\u2019s in her fourth year of High School. It is Gloria's dream to send her daughter to college to earn a degree, get a stable job, and have a good life.\r\n\r\n<p>Fishing is the main source of income for the family because of their proximity to the sea. At first, Gloria relied wholly on her husband's income as a fisherman. But maintaining a fishing business requires a capital infusion from time to time, especially to cover repairs and maintenance of the nets and boat. This is the reason why Gloria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995\u2014to access new capital so that her family could sustain their fishing business. \r\n\r\n<p>With consecutive loans from NWTF-Project Dunggano, that Gloria borrowed and repayed, their income increased and Gloria saw her husband's fishing business become stable and sustainable. This prompted her in 2004 to take out a loan to start a general store so she could supplement her husband's income and help with the family's expenses. Her subsequent loans were alternately used to increase the working capital of her general store and the family\u2019s fishing business, and have helped earn her an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.\r\n\r\n<p>For now, Gloria\u2019s focus is in the expansion of her general store. Her 9th cycle loan of PHP 19,500 was used to add to her working capital so she could have more inventory to sell. For her 10th cycle loan, she is again requestion PHP 19,500 to continue expansion of her store. She intends to use the income to supplement her husband's earnings to help support the family and set aside something for her daughter's college education.\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:_In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few women but thousands of them. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a meager $1 a day, to creating realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":401394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":430577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To improve the quality of her business premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eni  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757727},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146821},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984966},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015639},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740645},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":71906.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773759}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T20:48:03Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":158955,"name":"Bukari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bukari Y. is married and has five dependents.

To supply additional income, Lilibeth wants to expand the family variety store business through obtaining additional working capital. \r\n\r\nLilibeth would like to receive a loan of 19,000 PHP to purchase an inventory of rice, liquors, cases of beers, canned goods, and other supplies for her variety store. Lilibeth believes that offering a wider assortment of goods to her customers will increase traffic to her variety store and maintain customer loyalty in the community.\r\n\r\nSince the course of her membership in ASHI, Lilibeth has achieved strong performance with regular attendance to group meetings and solid repayments.  Lilibeth is thankful for access to capital and loans to support her entrepreneurial dreams. With the support of ASHI and Kiva, she is hopeful that their expanded business will continue to flourish to improve the family\u2019s quality of life and fund all of her children\u2019s college education.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: \r\n\r\nAhon Sa Hirap Inc.

He is 46 years old, married, and has four children, ages 28, 20, 9 and 6.  All the children go to school.  Carlos finished tenth grade but did not continue because of financial difficulties and because he had to start working while very young.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports two brothers and two younger relatives (nieces or nephews) who live with him.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, he left Inhambane to come to Maputo while completing his military service.  In 1986 he got married and established a home, where he is still living today.  Carlos works in general medicine in the military hospital and has a salary of 10,800 meticais per month.  He uses the money for household expenses and saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Carlos learned about Hluvuku through its loan officers, who came to his workplace to run an enrollment drive.  This is his third loan, and he is asking for 30,000 meticais.  He intends to buy construction materials (sand, cement, blocks, zinc sheets, beams and other items) to continue construction on his house.\r\n\r\nCarlos promises to pay off this loan on time so he can take out other loans.  In the future he would like to ask for more loans to finish building and furnishing his house.  He also intends to ask for a loan to buy a vehicle.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

It worked well for them selling provisions as in the area where they lived there was no store because it was separate from the city as a river crosses through this area.

They have five children who are between 11 and 21 years old. Sonia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sonia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10.000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for fish vending so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children & for house improvements. Sonia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Despite that, she is very happy since without any trouble she has been paying the rent to her brother. She needs to have a greater quantity of merchandize for her work in various prices.

She is married and has two children. In 2007, Aminata established her plastic slippers business. She began her business by selling on market days in the villages. Now she has a stall and travels to various locations to sell. Working 6 days a week and 9 hours a day, she earns about Le 950,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan of Le 3,000,000. Aminata has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional plastic slippers for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 250,000. In the future, Aminata plans to educate her children to university level. She pays fees for her children and attends to their medical bills. The loan has been helpful as she now has a stall while continuing with her trips to the villages to sell on market days.

Currently, he grows onions on 0.50 hectares (1.24 acres) and wheat on 0.50 hectares (1.24 acres) of land. Now, when the business is stable, Ravshanbek believes that it shall be the main income for him in future.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Today, Ravshanbek is applying for a loan for the first time. He requests 2000.00 Somoni ($600.00 USD) for 7 months. Ravshanbek is planning to purchase seeds, fertilizer, and combustive-lubricating materials. He will also use the part of the loan to pay the salaries of seasonal workers. Ravshanbek thanks everyone who trusts him by supporting him today. He promises to pay back the loan in a timely manner.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":137765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seed, fertilizer, combustive-lubricating materials, and to pay the salaries of seasonal workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T01:23:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ravshanbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-02T16:11:37Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.71},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":285.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.71},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":286.67,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":296.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192583},{"amount":86,"local_amount":286.67,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":296.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":220288},{"amount":86,"local_amount":286.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":296.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249474},{"amount":86,"local_amount":286.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":296.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278143},{"amount":86,"local_amount":286.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:42:56Z","rounded_local_amount":296.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307627},{"amount":86,"local_amount":286.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":296.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338714},{"amount":83.99,"local_amount":279.98,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":290.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323626},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":0.03,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T03:09:23Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-21T03:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":0.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10242378}],"funded_date":"2008-03-19T16:11:37Z","paid_date":"2009-01-21T03:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":44039,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Vilma has been working in her little shop, located inside her home, for 15 years.

His auto shop is located in a zone where competition is fierce: at the 66th kilometer mark on route 2, in the city of Eusebio Ayala. He began his career by taking classes at the town's trade institute and later by working hands-on with his father at the shop they owned in the city of Caacup\u00e9. For ten years he worked there, and he only left when he felt he had obtained the experience necessary to do his job comfortably. Currently, Mr. Patrocionio owns a home-based auto shop that is equipped with modern tools, which were purchased with loans he received from Fundacion Paraguaya. It was hard in the beginning because customers wanted to become familiar with the quality of his work, but thanks to clients', neighbors' and friends' recommendations, now he has a solid clientele. He says that his main accomplishment has been taking risks to achieve his professional independence. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":220742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase lubricants, parts and other accessories.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Married to Erwin C., a jeepney barker, they are blessed with five children. She helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been managing her own buy and sell business for two years now.\r\n\r\nMarina has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow four times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She has been consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her buy and sell business.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a loan of PHP 9,000.

is easy to start up the business. It usually begins with table-top selling and then grows to become a kiosk and eventually becomes a supermarket. Isheitu is one of such entrepreneurs; she has been trading in groceries like biscuits, bottled water, candies, canned foods, rice, cooking oil, toiletries, etc. for the past 6 years. She is hoping that, one day, she will be able to rent a bigger shop to expand her business. \r\n\r\nIsheitu is excited to be taking the loan which she plans to invest in purchasing groceries in bulk to serve her customers. She anticipates increasing her profit level and also expanding her market. \r\n\r\nIsheitu is married to a farmer and they have two children, ages 7 and 13. She describes herself as an excellent group leader of 'Adiyisem' Borrower Group, made up of 6 members. As the leader of the group, she ensures regular meeting attendance and repayment of loan installments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":556655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase groceries in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Sunyani","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.333333 -2.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akosua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anastasia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isheitu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eric","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":2700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151958739},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T09:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":454.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159697416},{"amount":316.67,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-05T08:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":454.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166911570},{"amount":316.66,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-12T11:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":454.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172179094},{"amount":475,"local_amount":675,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-18T11:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":681.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177475264},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T11:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182612165},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":225,"processed_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T11:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182612166}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T10:21:03Z","paid_date":"2011-01-08T11:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":212876,"name":"Sodji","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"E. exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce de produits d\u2019alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il fait  ce commerce depuis 5 ans  d\u00e9j\u00e0 et s\u2019approvisionne au grand march\u00e9 de Lom\u00e9, il souhaite gonfler son stock raison pour laquelle il sollicite de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit  pour s\u2019approvisionner et augmenter son stock.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, an electronic shop and a mineral water sales business. Her husband Marino, who is 60 years old, works as a technician to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 26 and 32 years old. Ruby joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 28 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruby has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 29th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to buy items for her store and mineral water so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Ruby is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He works in the city of Ica, which is currently known as one of the main cities in the country in which to invest.  This has been achieved thanks to the opening of new shopping malls with retailers from different parts of the country.  These big companies have given work opportunities to many more people.  This has also benefited those who do not work in these large shopping malls.  One case is that of Dairo who, thanks to the increase in the number of people and the great need that they have to move around, has been able to make more income with a lot of effort and commitment.\r\n\r\nDairo is a young man who very much likes playing football (soccer) in his free time.  This allows him to spend time with his friends.  Dairo works an average of 8 hours a day which allows him to make 45 soles a day.  One must bear in mind that the cost per trip via this mode of transport costs between 1 and 1.5 soles, depending on distance.  Dairo thinks that his business is successful because he starts work early and puts in a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nDairo's mother encouraged him to start out in this business so that he could make his own income.  Thanks to Kiva lenders, Dairo will be able to pay off the remaining installments on the motorcycle taxi that he works with.  This help will mean that in a few months time thanks to his efforts and, of course, the support of Kiva lenders, he will be able to buy another motorcycle taxi with which to work.

Siempre trabaj\u00f3 en diversas actividades por la responsabilidad que ten\u00eda en criar a sus tres hijos, ahora se ocupa a la venta de carne de pollo y a la construcci\u00f3n de cajones, estas dos actividades las realiza en su domicilio, tratando siempre de prestar el tiempo necesario a su familia.Trabajar en su casa le ayuda a no alejarse de sus hijos y dedicarse a la par con sus dos negocios, siendo esto lo que m\u00e1s le agrada, la flexibilidad de tiempo, pero siempre existen los aspectos dif\u00edciles, siendo uno de ellos, el cumplir con los pedidos de cajones, ya que por falta de maquinaria o algunos recursos la limitan a seguir trabajando. Lidia tiene visualizado el ver a sus hijos profesionales, esto es su mejor motor de progreso. Est\u00e1 muy convencida en invertir el dinero que solicita en la compra de mayor cantidad de madera y atender a las demandas de las personas, y con el tiempo ser una gran empresaria en este rubro en su localidad."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":190800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase wood to make crates in order to increase business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-08-14T07:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-28T13:24:32Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-09-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":207.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":340548},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-10-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":207.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372911},{"amount":70.5,"local_amount":199.06,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":205.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335716},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":206.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956894},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":206.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227144},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":206.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422386}],"funded_date":"2008-08-14T13:24:32Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64543,"name":"Aydee","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Aydee tiene 26 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus tres hijos.

She lives with her husband and three children.  She is a young mother who strives to obtain daily sustenance for her family, and she does so doing farm work.  It was six years ago that she got married and began to share this work with her husband.  She grows potato, 'olluco' and some vegetables like onion.  She generally does this in the afternoons because in the mornings, she works at a government program called \"Wawawasi\".  There, her work is like that of a nanny- she offers her house and her time to take care of children of other women when they are working and don't have a place to leave their children.  During harvest time, her work load increases, but her efforts pay off because she is then able to take her products to the city to sell directly.  While she waits for this moment, she also devotes her time to other money making activities such as breeding livestock to fatten and then sell.  This is how she passes the time during the 6 month wait until harvest.  Aydee constantly strives for her well being and that of her children.  With this loan, she will be able to purchase a bull, so she can continue succeeding with her crops and livestock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Natalie Kane, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":201599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a bull to increase the number of her livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-18T03:30:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-02T05:06:18Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335958},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957136},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227386},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422621},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115844},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010808}],"funded_date":"2008-09-18T05:06:18Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"thu doan","image":55858}},{"id":68651,"name":"Dilorom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Married to Philippe Kohoun, Bernadette is the mother of four children who are all in school, two of whom she is currently supporting. The couple takes care of the family expenses together. Having dropped out of school at the secondary level, for almost five years Bernadette has been selling fabric and \"bouillie\" (cornstarch or millet based food) accompanied by p\u00e2t\u00e9 (made with a wheat flour base). Bernadette also sells fabric. Bernadette gets her supplies in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin and in the Ouando market in Porto-Novo. Bernadette sells her bouillie in the Danto school in Porto-Novo, but she sells her fabric in Ouando. This is Bernadette's first loan with Alid\u00e9. Bernadette is requesting this loan from Alid\u00e9 to increase her working capital and to better satisfy her customer's needs.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her retail business,  she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 55,000. \r\n\r\nGina  is now borrowing PHP 29,500 so that she  can  purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 21st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For twenty years she has been running a dairy business, distributing milk and homemade milk products to regular buyers.  It took much effort and trying several different types of businesses before she focused on milk production. \r\n\r\nFor a long period of time, Olmaskhan was a farmer, gathering crops each fall.  She later switched to retail, selling food products in a local market.  After that, she bought cattle and made the first attempts at milk retail. The business was started with the small amount of 5,000 soms.  She now makes twice that amount each month.  Olmaskhan has two young kids and, not long ago, gave birth to a third child. The toddler needs care and good conditions. Olmaskhan hopes to receive her portion of the loan, which she will spend on the purchase of a baby carriage. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This group is made up of five business people -- micro-entrepreneurs -- and is located in the rural area of Samana, a lush, rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. \r\n\r\nYdelsa lives with her long-term partner and her two children. She says that her biggest challenge is to build her house as a safe structure made of concrete blocks, and her most favorite things to do are learn and visit her friends and family. She runs a jewelry sales business, selling jewelry door to door and by walking around her community. With this loan, she will purchase silver jewelry, like rings, necklaces, bracelets, and other silver accessories. \r\n\r\nShe is excited to receive her fourth loan with Esperanza. She has been part of this group for almost two years, and with each loan she has been able to improve her sales and has earned more clients. With the profits from her business, she will reinvest in her business and put more income into her house. Ydelsa thanks all of you for your support of her business and her group.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will enable her to earn more profit and enable her to cater for the requirements of her four fatherless children as she was widowed at a tender age.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":547144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy foodstuffs and a pool table for her hotel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-30T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jolly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jovia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arthur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johnson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4990000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1247500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662506},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689284},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903440},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1247500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1259332.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296917}],"funded_date":"2010-06-03T17:00:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":208811,"name":"Fanni Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fanny Rosa, tiene 41 a\u00f1os, es casada, tiene dos hijos y es natural del Cusco.

He is married and has five children of school age. Ziyodullo is producing the national cradles. The national cradles in Tajikistan are very colorful. They are made of wood. As a rule, the national cradle is presented by the grandparents when the baby is 40 days old and this event is celebrated in the family circle. \r\n\r\nZiyodullo has been in this business for 11 years.

For the entire period of time, he had shown himself as a successful client, managing his loans with accuracy and precision. Today, Ziyodullo requests a loan in the amount of 6900 Somoni in order to purchase planks and paints for producing the cradles. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She used to be a member of 'Nueva Esperanza' (New Hope), a group of borrowers that have appeared on Kiva.org more than once and have always successfully repaid their loans. Simenis is now asking for a loan as an individual because she requires a larger amount than is usually offered to borrowers that are members of a group. \r\n\r\nSimenis lives in the Hato Mayor region of the Dominican Republic, located in the east of the country. Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture. Simenis' community, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from a constant shortage of running water and electricity. As well as Dominicans, Haitian immigrants make up a large proportion of Simenis' community.\r\n  \r\nSimenis requires her loan to invest in stock for her clothing business. As well as clothes, Simenis sells a variety of footwear - shoes, trainers and slippers. Simenis started this business 12 years ago and actually lists her favourite pastime as trading with customers! Simenis is very excited about taking out another loan so that she can continue to grow her business. She hopes to finish off the construction of her house with the profits that she makes, something which she also says is her biggest current challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":648952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To invest in her clothes business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Hato Mayor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T02:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simenis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1189.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1034.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1157.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1199.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1283.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1289.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1346.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1384.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1442.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1487.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1541.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1598.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.46,"local_amount":1189.52,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534135},{"amount":29.08,"local_amount":1034.16,"processed_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1070.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670891},{"amount":37.88,"local_amount":1347,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1394.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414225},{"amount":35.16,"local_amount":1250.17,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1294.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991105},{"amount":36.31,"local_amount":1291,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1336.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275177},{"amount":37.17,"local_amount":1321.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1368.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142442},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":2807.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2906.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215488},{"amount":83.21,"local_amount":2958.6,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3062.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657353},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":2799.93,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2898.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227025267}],"funded_date":"2010-11-24T04:17:57Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":253889,"name":"Teddy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teddy N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Njeru in the Jinja region of Uganda.

In 2000, she established her religious statue-making business.  Working 7 days a week and 6 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW.  Tari mai used her most recent loan to buy raw materials such as bronze, wax and silver for her work.  In the future, Tari mai plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts.  Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  \r\n\r\nIn Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

She is 60 years old, is married, and has 8 adult children. To make a living, Elisa owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC of 3000 PHP, which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Elisa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
