Asimismo ha sembrado 60 sacos de semilla de papa, pero esta papa no es para consumo, m\u00e1s bien, es destinada para ser la semilla, para Eusebio es m\u00e1s rentable que vender papa para consumo. Tambi\u00e9n comenta que es muy rentable invertir en la compra de animales grandes, con su primer pr\u00e9stamo de MFP compr\u00f3 una vaca y que ahora ya tiene su cr\u00eda.

He owns his own home.  Since he was a child, he has dedicated himself to farming.  In addition, he has always raised livestock such as cows and bulls to help him plow his fields so he can plant in large quantities.  Currently, he has planted three sacks of pea seeds.  Eusebio prefers to plant a seed called \u201cSuper-Improved\u201d which is more resistant than other varieties of seed.  During planting season he yields 4 or 5 stalks per hill which is very favorable, having fertilized well first, of course.  Likewise, he has planted 60 sacks of potato seed.  These potatoes are not for consumption, and are instead destined to become seed which is more profitable for Eusebio.  He also tells us that it is profitable to invest in the purchase of large livestock.  With his first loan from MFP, he bought a cow and he now has its offspring.  Eusebio has received a loan with MFP four times, and the entire time he has not had a problem paying his installments on the designated date.  He promises to continue paying this loan on time as well.  The funds he requests are for the purchase of three bags of pea seeds, each bag costing 600.00 Peruvian soles.  The remainder of the funds will be invested into insecticides to fumigate his crops.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":261601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase seeds and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":517.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989721},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210857}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T20:37:50Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":89929,"name":"Millicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Millicent A. is 34 years old.

She is the mother of three children, is a housewife, and is a selfless wife, who works with her husband. She and her husband have a bakery located in the center of the city of Jipijapa in the province of Manab\u00ed, and they start working very early in the morning, at 3:00 am.\r\n\r\nEveryday, they start baking 400 loaves of salty and sweet bread. Once the bread is out of the oven at 5:00 am, her husband begins delivering bread to the houses of their clients to fill their orders. Without a doubt, this is work that requires a lot of dedication because their goal is to sell all of the bread that is produced that day. What is not sold during the day is shared with their family because one of the rules for these bakeries is that the next day, the flour must the fresh. They have never sold day-old bread, since doing this would harm their business.\r\n\r\nMartha thinks that in the four years that they have had this business, their family has gotten many benefits, because they have been able to work together as a family. She also said that with their work, they have been able to offer an education to their children.

despite the adversities of life.  They are partners in solidarity who always have a positive attitude; they radiate happiness in the bi-monthly meetings where they share their everyday experiences.  They live in different areas in the City of Cuenca.   Se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica M. lives in the Carmen sector of Sinincay, located 45 minutes outside the outskirts of the City of Cuenca.

Her older son is studying in the Francisco D\u00e1vila school where he has completed his second  year of basic education.  Her husband works as a taxi driver in a local cooperative.  They do not yet have a house of their own; they live in a rented house owned by a relative.\r\n\r\nMonica has worked in her beauty parlor for 7 years.  The premises are leased.  She tells us that there are good days and bad days, but one must give thanks to God for everything He provides to us.  Her many years of experience have enabled her to develop her clientele.  She also told us that thanks to her work she is able to obtain money on a daily basis to help with the household expenses and pay the rent on her parlor.  She works from 8am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday each week.  This is her sixth cycle with the communal bank.  She is very grateful to the foundation because it has allowed her to improve her business, to associate with other women to help generate their incomes, and, most importantly, to cultivate good friendships with all of the members of her bank.  With this loan that the ESPOIR foundation is giving her, she is going to purchase products such as: permanent solution, hair dyes, nail enamel, beauty treatments, etc., in order to improve her business and provide quality service.  Monica's biggest dream is to have her own house, where she could put up her own beauty parlor.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":392723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty products such as permanent solution, hair dyes, nail enamels, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":330,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134.05,"local_amount":126.39,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":134.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947485},{"amount":138.76,"local_amount":130.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":138.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789340},{"amount":33.44,"local_amount":31.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":33.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679770},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074359}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T09:12:01Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":143254,"name":"Marcos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcos is 50 years old and he is married to Myrna M., and they have six children.

For 12 years he has worked in agriculture growing potatoes, olluco (an Andean root vegetable), beans and vegetables such as carrots, onions and peas.  His wife is his main support when he completes his diverse tasks in the field.  He also raises cattle in a small cattle shed that he built next to his house.  In addition, he sells the products that he harvests in a market in the city of Aleda\u00f1a; in this way he is able to see the fruits of his labor.  Over the years he has strengthened the economic situation of his household, and this is the reason why he wishes to increase his crops and acquire more animals.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, charcoal sales and banana sales. Her husband Romeo, age 59, works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 20 to 35 years old. \r\n\r\nElisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use to purchase more bananas so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her granddaughter and to sustain her family's daily needs. Elisa B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Today Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The group's name is in the Mixtecan language and means \u201cThe stream (river) of the grandparents\u201d.  'YUTA' means 'stream (river)' and 'CHI' means 'grandparent'.  They decided to give the group this name since the town of Yutachi is near the group's meeting point, and also to honor of their ancestors.  There are 11 people in the group, together with their representative who is called Anastacia N. M..\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will talk about Mrs Esther Leonor Ba\u00f1os J. who is a member of this group.  She is 46 years old and married.  Her husband is called Lorenzo and he is 50 years old.  He works as a belt maker and as an agricultural worker.  They have been married for 22 years and have had 4 children.  Three of their children are still alive.  Josefina(+), who was their third child, died from health complications and lack of specialized medical care.  This was a result of the poverty and inequality of society.  Their remaining children are Alejandro, 21; Felipe, 19 and Joel who is 11 and is pursuing his secondary education.  Esther only studied at elementary level.\r\n\r\nEsther used the loan which they were awarded to acquire material to use for making her hand-made embroideries.  She makes handbags, wallets, blouses, napkins and tablecloths using a number of different stitches such as cross-stitch, 'trenza margarita', 'pato de gallo', rococo, star, chain, the complicated technique of openwork in cross stitch and the embroidery of blouses with seedglass beads.  Among the long list of materials which she uses for this beautiful work are the following: Panama linen, cotton skirting, tergal (a synthetic fibre containing polyester),  hand-spun cotton, different threads such as cotton thread, worsted for embroideries and 'iris vela' thread, all in different colors, stitch unpickers, seedglass beads, embroidery hoops and different sized needles.  She started her business more than four years ago owing to her own need for financial improvement.\r\n\r\nEsther's biggest dream is to gather together a large number of people who live in conditions of extreme poverty, to teach them everything that she knows without distinction of sex or creed.  She would like to promote self employment for the most vulnerable who are women and indigenous people.  Another of her goals is for other people to find out about her crafts and promote them so that she can make more profits and, in this way, help her project grow as well as provide support for her children's education.\r\n\r\nEsther is currently working hard on training more people to work through a social office called ICAPET as well as the governmental program for indigenous people called CDI.  This shows that despite the great inequality of society, there are still people who dream, who are doing something and that their great commitment is their love towards other people.\r\n\r\nShe tells us to speak with these words, \u201cI am grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for trusting in the poor, for helping to free us from these chains which bind us called poverty and for believing in an abandoned sector of society who nobody turns to see.  Thank you for everything and God bless you forever\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the members of this group and their business activities:\r\n\r\nSalustia T.

She is married to Jumar, 34, a timekeeper. She is also the mother of one child who is now in grade IV. While attending to her husband and child, she also keeps herself busy with her business as her way of helping her husband pay for the family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nJiael is a bayong maker. Bayong is a native bag in the Philippines made of rubberized plastic and hand woven. Jiael makes different sized bags depending on the request of clients in the market and malls. She also creates different designs such as square, triangle, and oblong. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more raw materials. With the Christmas season fast approaching, her numerous customers will place many orders for bayong to be used as fruit trays and vanity kits. \r\n  \r\nJiael hopes that her business will continue to generate an income that will provide for the needs of her family. She dreams that she can continue making bayong and attending to her family needs at the same time. She hopes that her family will remain simple and happy.

Meet Jeniffer, a 31-year-old mrembo (beautiful woman) who is humble, honest and a very hardworking mum on this planet Earth. Jeniffer adores her lovely family very much. She will always do anything good to keep them from going to bed with hungry stomachs. \n\nJeniffer hails from the Kericho area of Kenya. She has never had the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job, but this has not killed her dream of wanting to succeed in life. She has been farming for the past six years. Throughout these years, she has gathered much experience and has all the farming techniques at her fingertips. \n\nJeniffer practices mixed farming on her farm. With her profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her 4 children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey\" to success.\n\nJeniffer is very enterprising. She is seeking a loan of 65,000 Kenyan shillings to buy seeds and begin horticulture farming on her farm. Jeniffer wants to take advantage of, and reap more profits from, favorable weather patterns, her village's good road network, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products. \n\nJuhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Jeniffer turn their farming dreams into realities through training and loan financing. Jeniffer hopes that she will improve her living conditions through this loan. Her dreams and projections are, by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but also in international markets through fruit and vegetable exports.

has been selling women's handbags for the last 10 years. He is married and has 4 children. His store is located at the Korvon market in Dushanbe, capital of Tadjikistan. To the question as to why he chose to sell this type of goods he responded that he likes to come up with designs for handbags. He has a creative soul and enjoys picking out his wares on his trips to China to restock. In the future he is hoping to open a handbag making workshop and for this purpose he is having his son study at the university as a leather goods designer. Currently the goods turnaround at his store is very fast and he is saving up money for the workshop for his son. He would like to use the loan from Kiva in order to buy additional shipments of handbags to expand his selection.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

Her work schedule is from very early in the morning until three in the afternoon when she goes home. She hopes to grow her business in order to achieve her goals of improving her home. \n\nCandida Rosa L\u00f3pez sells fruits and vegetables in the municipal market of Mayasa. She has many years' experience in this business, which she learned from her mother. From the very early hours of the morning, she purchases her products from the trucks that arrive with vegetables from the northern zone of the country and later in the day, she resells these products. She has two adolescent children and they help her with her sales. Her husband works for himself and he helps with the expenses of the home. Her loan she will use to purchase a wider variety of fruits and thus increase her sales. \n\nJuana Antonia, just like her fellow group members, sells fruits and vegetable in the market in Masaya. She is the coordinator of the group, as she is very responsible and she has the respect of the whole community. She has children, but they are independent.  She dreams of improving her home and always being able to support herself. She will invest in the purchase of more perishable products and this way vary the products she will sell. Her husband helps with the expenses of the home. He works in the transportation business for the market. \n\nThe group members tell us that Adim has taught them to better control and improve their businesses with the training they have received, and that they have helped them in their personal lives as well. They propose to work with Adim for several cycles and are clear that this will be the case only if they can be disciplined in their repayments. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle

Betty gets up very early to prepare the food for the day, while her husband cuts the oats and feeds the cows.  Around 8am, she tidies up and brings milk to the neighbor, who makes cheeses.  After, her husband ties up the cows in the countryside.  Betty is responsible for lunch and together, they manage their farmlands to turn over the land and take out the weeds.

Both children are still financially dependent on her and her husband.  Mary has been living in government-subsidized housing for 11 years.  When they moved to this house, Mary was already tired of their lack of financial resources and the lack of attention that they were able to give their children who were then 2 and 7 years old.  She decided that she had to do something to contribute towards their household expenses without neglecting her children and her husband.  This is when she had the idea to start selling sweet treats, fried food, cookies and soft drinks, thereby making an income for her family.  Mary gradually acquired a wide range of products for her business which has been the only source of income for her and her family.  For this reason, Mary is requesting support so that she can buy more merchandise and stock her business.  She wants to be prepared by having available the products that she sells the most of during the Christmas season.

Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and rice to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArlene hopes her business will grow into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It was founded in 1969 by the United Methodist Church to educate the children of the community and to support the church. It is one the oldest schools in town. UMC currently has an enrollment of 917 pupils and a staff of twenty-five dedicated teachers.\r\n\r\nBecause of the dedication of its teachers, UMC Primary students achieve outstanding results in the National Primary School Examination (NPSE). Almost always, 99% of UMC Primary pupils pass the examination to enter secondary school. The children also participate in extracurricular activities, such as football (soccer), other athletic games, and  social events organized for all primary schools in Makeni.\r\n\r\nTeaching is a rewarding profession, but it is not well paid. Government salaries for teachers are usually small, so teachers often have to supplement their incomes. But with this loan, they will be able to invest in something meaningful and gradually repay the loan within a ten-month period from their monthly salaries.Some of the teachers will use their portion of the loan to pay school fees for themselves or their children. Other will invest their portion in businesses or farming. And others will use their portion to buy furniture or improve their homes. This is the first loan UMC Primary school is seeking from SMT. They were inspired by UMC Secondary school to apply for a loan from SMT.\r\n\r\nSallamatu B. (3rd from Left) is the head teacher of this school. Sallamatu was born in Yoni Banna, a small town in the Tonkolili district. She is thirty-six years old. She is married to the principal of UMC Secondary School, Makeni, and the couple has two children. She has been teaching for the past fourteen years.

Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nShe buys the palm nuts from local farmers in her community; processes it in her house to produce the oil, and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from palm fruit that is cooked, pounded, sieved, and boiled for hours. The reddish oil is skimmed off and reboiled to expel water content. Alice would use the loan to buy the palm fruits in bulk so as to supply more customers. \r\n\r\nShe believes the loan would enable her to scale up production to serve a larger market and eventually improve her family finances.

Therefore, it is sold at a cheaper cost. When fish is out of season, the price gets high and people tend to buy dried fish instead. This is actually common for the whole Antique province and products are even sold in huge malls in different cities in different regions. \r\n\r\nFor Elizabeth, the proceeds of her business will be used to finance the basic needs of her children.

She is married and has eight children.  They live together in Quimbiri, located in Cusco's beautiful woods, where they have their own house. The most relevant thing for Astria is \"creativity and perseverance\"--a maxim she applies to her agricultural work.  That's how she cultivates coffee, which is the source of her income. She is able to harvest a large amount of coffee, and her customers are happy with the quality of her product. She normally works alongside her family, and they work together well.  There is also the additional savings in expenses, since there is no need to hire outside workers. She usually sells her coffee in distribution centers in her area and at a competitive price. Her daily routine is to leave home at 7 am and return at 6 pm.  She only rests on Sunday, when she can be with her family.  Her plans for the future are to increase her agricultural production so as to build a house with good materials so that her family can be safer and more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is her six loan with microfinance partner MFP, and she promises to meet her payment schedule.  She also would like to thank her community bank, where everyone is responsible for paying their respective loans.  She will use this money to invest in buying supplies and fertilizer in order to adequately maintain her coffee plantation.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ross Forman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":597955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy provisions and fertilizer for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326960}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T14:49:33Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":234221,"name":"Mary Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jean M. is from the village of Palacapao, Quezon, Bukidnon.

He sells charcoal to the local people. He has been in this business for ten years now and has one employee. He says that the business is profitable. He says that his major challenge is financial constraints. However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well.

She is married with 2 children age 4 and 2 and has been in farming for 4 years. She fully relies on farming for her family upkeep. Her farm produces tea, milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nCherono has requested for a loan of 50,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow.

He is 46 years old. Joel is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJoel is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Joel runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Joel has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joel is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Joel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 58 years old. Floria is the group leader of a 10-member group. While each member of the group receives an individual loan through ASKI, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is the Floria B. Group.\r\n\r\nFloria is married and has two adult children. To earn a living, Floria owns and operates a general store. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Floria has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Floria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Floria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Floria is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This  will be the eleventh loan taken out by Floria through ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue it generates to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva and edited by a human editor. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Together they live in the town of Quimbiri, located in the beautiful tropical jungle of Cusco, where they have their own house made of wood. In spite of having incomplete primary education, this was not an excuse to not continue with his dream to have his own business, and so he succeeded in cultivating and producing coffee. Now he has faithful buyers who always go to him for the high quality of this product. On the other hand, his ambition is to have an auto body shop, so he can obtain the necessary income to cover the basic needs of his family. It is because of this that he needs to work to generate the necessary capital to put into practice the workshop that he wants to open. Normally, he has the help of his family, who assist with the extraction and selection of his agricultural product, which is sold in the collection centers of their town. This is his sixth loan with MFP, for which he promises to continue following his payment schedule. He is satisfied with his communal bank, because of the good advantages it offers him.

The institution helps her to improve not only her living conditions, but also the social aspects of her life, which is very useful to her and to her funeral homes\/services.\r\n\r\nEven at 59, her perseverance never fades. When her husband died, she is the one who managed the business and most of her time is spent on her business and with her children. Moreover, she is doing her best to improve her business in order to sustain their basic needs. Through her hardship, courage and industry, her three children have already finished their studies and presently they all have stable jobs. Though her children have their own jobs, she never stops dreaming for their future. She also wants her business to improve in order to help other people in the community by providing employment. She also plans to help her relatives, so that they will become successful someday.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, Teresa is applying for PHP 35,000 which she will use as additional capital for her funeral services business. She would like to have a bigger capital base because there are times when she has costumers who can\u2019t afford to buy a coffin in cash, and since she is very considerate she let's her costumers pay for the items in installments. Therefore, a rolling capital will make this more feasible. \r\n\r\nTeresa is now more dignified and happy because there are institutions, like ASHI and its field partner KIVA, which trust and believe in her.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":647438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"For

pleasant to help somebody\u2019s talent prosper and see the achieved results. Masimkan is one of those who developed her talent thanks to this loan.\r\n\r\nMasimkan T., 54, is a leader of this group. She is divorced and lives with a young grandson. For last ten years she\u2019s been doing a small business by offering sewing services. In the beginning she was offering just small services in repairing of clothes. Later she applied for her first loan from Kiva through its Kyrgyz partner, Mol Bulak Finance. It really helped her to promote her business and to realize her new ideas. She brought new innovations into her clothing industry. Step by step she transferred to designing national clothing and to set her level of qualification higher. Soon she tended to have permanent customers ordering new designs on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan from Kiva, Masimkan plans to purchase new high-quality fabrics and to design new styles of outfits. Every month she gets income of 7,000 soms, which she spends on daily needs for herself and her grandson. A portion of her profit is reinvested back into the business and the rest is saved. Masimkan was very happy when she saved enough to purchase home electronics and to send her son to Russia to find a permanent job. For Masimkan, this is a second loan offered by Kiva, so she is sure she\u2019ll do her best to repay the loan on time, according to the schedule.\r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

a strong and successful entrepreneur and can be the basis for one to glide over business adversity and periods of burnout. \r\n\r\nThe self-starting Jane set the ball rolling in her general merchandise retail trade three years ago in Kihihi in Western Uganda. Retail businesses are highly profitable this side of the country and many people involved in them have been able to improve their circumstances and their families' standards of living.\r\n\r\nFor Jane, a happy-go-lucky mother of three, this has principally unfolded because she has established strong working relationships with a variety of people, mostly her customers, over the years.\r\n\r\nShe has also been good at making pivotal decisions and organizing her finances, all aimed at strengthening her business. \r\n\r\nAt her shop she sells a variety of general merchandise retail items such as sugar, salt, jerrycans, rice, beans, cooking oil, eggs, etc.\r\n\r\nHer strong business notwithstanding, her achievements and strides have been afflicted by inevitable cost issues, lack of sufficient stock when demand is high and envy.\r\n \r\nShe has weathered most of those storms rather successfully and she anticipates that better horizons will open up in the not-so-far future. This, she believes, will happen if she does not rest on her laurels.\r\n\r\nWeekly, her gross sales profits are to the tune of UGX 300,000, and she says the purpose of this Kiva loan is to aid her in the purchase of more high-demand retail commodities such as maize flour, cooking oil, sugar, bread, rice and beans to resell.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":820699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more commodities such as maize flour, cooking oil, sugar, bread, rice and beans to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-25T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1034000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022810}],"funded_date":"2011-07-31T04:22:19Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T08:01:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":324397,"name":"Adita Mariana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Portoviejo, capital de Manab\u00ed conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  como la ciudad de los reales tamarindos, se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas  las socias del Banco Comunal Mujeres 13 De Septiembre.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Adita, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 divorciada pero de esa relaci\u00f3n tiene seis  hijos, cuatro de ellos  mayores de edad y dos de 17 y 14 a\u00f1os que estudian en colegio, cinco de sus hijos aun viven en su casa.

When Fida'ee takes the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will purchase the repair kit for the taxi to fix things when needed and to pay for licensing and insuring the taxi so it will be legal. Fida'ee will work extra hours to increase his income and live with his family in better conditions.

When she was a child her parents taught him everything related to agriculture.\nShe lives in the rich highlands of Kapsowar with her husband and 5 children. Naum has been practicing farming for the past 7 years and, through those years, she has been able to support her family. Her primary sources of income are eggs, milk, and crop farming.\n\nThe Kapsowar area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Nahum's biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. \n\nPoultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kapsowar and you don\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer or have so many poultry birds to benefit from it. Through the loan, Naum will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":25841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-12T06:16:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T19:49:44Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":625,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":105,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21415},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T17:55:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45284},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:28:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51896},{"amount":471,"local_amount":471,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:54:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":471,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107761}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T19:49:44Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:54:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12161,"name":"Osman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I.

Dalam menekuni usahanya Putu tergabung di kelompok ternak babi Kembang Mekar. Pinjaman pertama ke DINARI memberi pengaruh yang sangat bagus untuk perkembangan usaha ternak babinya. Untuk jangka waktu pemeliharaan 5 bulan Putu Yeni bisa mendapat keuntungan sampai Rp.500.000,-. Karena itulah Putu Yeni melanjutkan kerja sama dengan DINARI melalui pinjaman yang kedua. Pinjaman berjangka waktu 6 bukan ini akan digunakannya untuk menambah populasi ternak babinya dengan membeli 3 ekor bibit penggemukan disamping induk babi yang sudah dimilikinya. Dan sisa dari pembelian bibit akan digunakan untuk membeli pakan ternak. Diharapkan dengan bertambahnya jumlah peliharaan serta pinjaman yang semakin meningkat maka bisa dimanfaatkan untuk membeli pakan yang lebih berkualitas sehingga akan menghasilkan panen yang lebih baik dari sebelumnya dan pada akhir periode nanti bisa mengembalikan pinjaman dari DINARI.

She wants to achieve all this with much effort and constant work.\r\nNarcisa raises pigs and sells the pork on foot.  Her operation is at her house.  She has had this business for twelve years.  She got involved in the business because this type of business was already in her family.  She has stuck with it because it is not too difficult, but she had trouble attracting customers because she has a lot of competition, and all the people in this type of business already had their own customers.  This is why, in the beginning, she decided to go out into the streets to try to sell her meat and nacatamales (a special Latin American tamale).  The different customers she gained were from other places.  They began coming to her house to buy nacatamales, fried foods, and charrascas.  These customers made her business known, and her neighbors came by her house and bought more that they liked.  Now she is requesting a loan to increase her working capital, since she has to look for pigs and travel here and there to get them at the best price and make the most of her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hannah Lily, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":261811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T03:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400013},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092011},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985394},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446009},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956650},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174075},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599697},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035589},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947998},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789971},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":503.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680669}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T03:48:45Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":90009,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys tiene 41 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus tres hijos en la casa que adquirieron hace tres a\u00f1os.

She and her family have a shoe factory where they make beautiful leather shoes, selling them wholesale to a number of retailers. They manufacture large quantities of shoes, especially during the school year, when they make shoes and send them to other provinces where they sell at higher prices. Within the production process, Gladys is in charge of sales and takes products to the capital to distribute them and, if she has the opportunity, even to sell them to individuals. She enjoys the work and does it every Friday and Saturday, which are very good days for business. The rest of the week, she takes care of running the factory and managing the staff, since her education in administration helps her in that area. She hopes eventually to improve her marketing, and is submitting paperwork to negotiate with governmental bodies that have requested large quantities of merchandise for the poorest schools in the country. She would like to be part of that project. Gladys is one of MFP's oldest clients, and this is her seventh loan. She tells us that her time working with our institution has helped her improve her factory and her interpersonal relations.

She is 40 years old. Mariefe is married and has four school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Mariefe owns and operates a business running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Mariefe has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mariefe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mariefe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nMariefe is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Mariefe from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
