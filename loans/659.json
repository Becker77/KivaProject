It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This loan will allow her to increase her working capital and purchase three bags of ingredients (corn, sorghum). \r\n\r\nHer big challenge is that her receipts are in local currency, the Congolese Franc. However, this is not a stable currency and the inflation is growing, which results in losses when Congolese Francs are exchanged into hard currency (US dollars). Like all locals, distrusting the Congolese currency, Kabira keeps her savings in US dollars. In addition, the production of \u201cMadrakwa\u201d is very labor-intensive, given that she is still using a very rudimentary technology, and thus she would like to change her type of business in the future. She would like to see her children finish their studies. \r\n\r\nThanks to the loans from Hekima, Kabira K. already has made visible progress: her earnings have allowed her to build a house with two bedrooms and a living room; she rents out the house to increase her income. Kabira Kalondera thanks Hekima for assisting impoverished citizens who do not have access to the traditional banking system. It should also be mentioned that the Iraqi group consists of 14 members. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":605415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"3 bags of ingredients (corn, sorghum)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

His shop is located in Wayerma I in Sikasso and he has conducted his business there for about five years.  He is very sought after because of the quality of his products. \r\n\r\nIn order to better satisfy his growing clientele, over three years ago he decided to rejoin the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is on his fifth individual loan.

Currently all the kids are in school. \r\n\r\nShe and her family live in Atebubu. Where they live is a typical farming community, where most settlers do farming, specifically crop farming. But Hawa opts to deal in supplying cloth, a business she started fifteen years ago with an amount of $20 at that time. Now Hawa can boast of its business expansion, which she accomplished with that little seed money with which she started her business. Since that time she has maintained product quality and customer relations. She requests the loan to buy more clothing materials like cloth, linen, and lace. Hawa treks her product to the surrounding communities to sell during their market days. \r\n\r\nThrough the proceeds from her output she has able to build a three-bedroom house with the able help of her husband. She is prepared to sell everything on her to give her kids good quality education. She said she would be grateful for your support. \r\n\r\nHawa belongs to a group in her community known as \u2018Ruth.\u2019 The group members agree to guarantee for one another as social collateral to access the loan and to repay the loan.

Sabe que los esfuerzos que ejerce en el buen cuidado de sus cultivos, son fundamentales para obtener una cosecha productiva, por eso cada ma\u00f1ana contenta se dirige a la chacra para cuidar sus plantaciones de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tanos y palta, pensando que su sacrificio ser\u00e1 recompensado. Lleva 25 a\u00f1os labrando la tierra junto a su esposo y ambos practican diferentes t\u00e9cnicas agr\u00edcolas que les dan buenos resultados.

She is married to Donato, 49, and they have 4 children, though only one still lives with them in the home they own. Lucila knows that her work taking care of her crops is crucial to a good harvest, and so every morning she is happy to head for the fields to take care of her coffee, bananas and avocados, thinking that her efforts will be rewarded. She has spent 25 years working the land with her husband, and each of them has their own special methods for getting good results. What Lucila likes most about farming is harvesting the coffee beans. Although it is difficult to get the crop to market in the city and to have it stored, she considers it a very profitable business. It fetches a good price at the market. Lucila is therefore planning to buy additional land where she can increase her coffee production. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with [field partner] MFP, and she can see the economic progress she has made already. She will continue to make her repayments responsibly because she wants to continue accessing credit to help her bsiness grow - and because she enjoys being part of this communal bank. With the loan she is seeking, Lucila will buy sacks of organic fertilizer to spread on her crops and increase productivity.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":581364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269255}],"funded_date":"2010-08-10T23:38:24Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":225389,"name":"Laskmi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal  \u201cPATRON DE SANTIAGO DE SANTIAGO\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Santiago, perteneciente a la provincia y departamento del Cusco.\n\nLa socia es  la Sra.

While each member of the group gets an individual loan, both are responsible for paying back the entire loan if the other person is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMaricel makes a living by selling snacks to people who live in her community. She has been engaged in this business for almost one year and earns about 1,000 PHP a month from her work\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maricel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and her ability to engage in business. Her loan group is  applying for its first loan, and she plans to use her 4,000 PHP portion to buy piglets to raise and later sell. She plans to use the additional income she earns from this loan to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or

For her, there are no days off because she must work continually in her field in order to have a good harvest.  The main things she grows are: cocoa beans, coffee and bananas which, once harvested, she takes to sell in various markets in the city of San Francisco.  What she most likes about her work is the freedom she has working her fields because she can freely enjoy the green countryside.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for 7 years and considers the most difficult part of it having to work during the heavy rainy season because rains in this part of the Peruvian Amazon region are continuous.

from Bamenda.  With this loan, Magdalene will continue her business of frying and selling gateau (a doughnut like treat), rearing pigs, and raising fowl.  Her business plan involves the purchase two piglets, 8 kilograms of animal feed, flour, sugar, yeast, oil, 50 chicks, and chicken feed.  She also plans to reinforce her fence with part of this loan.  She plans to use 104,000 CFA (approximately $210 USD) of her own savings to supplement her loan and ensure she has the most success in her businesses.  This loan will be repaid over a period of 18 months; the first payment will be made on the day the loan is dispersed.\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Regina's fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  She plans to sell her fried gateaux to children on their way to school and to farmers in the morning.  As there are many celebrations in the near future, including Christmas and New Years, chickens will be in high demand soon.  She hopes to raise her chickens to sell before these celebrations, as they only take 6 to 8 weeks to become full grown.  Her husband plans to help her raise her pigs and chickens, as he has a great deal of experience in raising animals.  She plans to support her community by providing them with chickens, pigs, fried gateaux, and manure for sale at reasonable prices.  Moreover, by purchasing her supplies, such as oil and pig feed, from her community, she will help to raise the incomes of others in her community.  With the profits from this loan, Magdalene plans to pay her children's school fees. This is extremely important to her as she was unable to continue her education as a child of poverty.  She also plans to improve her household.  Magdalene hopes that this loan will continue to increase her family's standard of living as those in the past have done.  She is grateful for the business training provided by GHAPE, and knows this training will be crucial in the success of her businesses.\r\n\r\n<p>The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount to a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and develops a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.<\/p>

fifth loan to invest in improving her home (whitewashing the house). She has worked at the Hospital Jacinto Hern\u00e1ndez as a supervisor for the past 28 years and she has a grown daughter, for whom she took on the role of both mother and father at an early age. She is very responsible, honest and hard-working, and has striven to improve her home bit by bit, located in the urban center of Nueva Guinea, a recently populated neighborhood and growing daily. Petrona is a woman of high spirits both personally and at work, which she loves. Although her daughter does not live with her, she does take care of her very elderly mother. Her dream is to have stability, health and a nice home.  Petrona is grateful to AFODENIC for the previous loans which helped her slowly build her home and this way she could bring greater comfort to her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

They are hard-working, determined women with a lot of hope for change.  They are women of scarce resources who live a daily fight to support their family.  With the help of their husbands, they have the enthusiasm and the desire to get ahead economically.\r\nEach one of them is requesting a loan between 300,000 and 500,000 guaran\u00eds ($62 to $104).

Maria has a business buying and selling clothing, new as well as used, which she sells in the streets, principally on order to people that she knows.  It should be noted that she works in a beauty salon called the Belleza Luz Marina salon, where she offers her products to her co-workers and customers of the salon.  This business began 5 years ago with very little working capital.  She was searching for a source of alternative income, since she had just had her first child and wanted to provide for him well.  She started out selling cosmetics, after that she started to invest in clothing and accessories; in addition she also sells jewelry, but only on order.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of more clothing, since it is now close to the Christmas season and Maria wants to invest and buy now when the prices are a little lower.

In the past four years the prices for fodder have almost tripled.\r\n\r\nGulnar N. is 56 years old, a leader of this group. She also fell victim to these economic events. Twelve years ago her starting capital was 12000 soms when she bought two calves. For the entire decade the resale of the cattle was stable. However in the past years the hike in prices on hay due to the weather conditions and water shortages made the situation for animal husbandry workers difficult.\r\n\r\nGulnar and her group are very grateful to Kiva for the loan. It is significantly helping her and other members of the group to alleviate themselves from the difficult financial situation. Gulnar has defined he purpose of this loan as for purchase of another calf to increase headcount of cattle.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":733258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a calf","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T22:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulnar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041c\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043a","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041c\u044b\u0437\u043a\u0430\u043b","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4040},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4350},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4470},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4608},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4905},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5108},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5255},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5512},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5764},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5988}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.86},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.98},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.86,"local_amount":4040,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":4122.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192753},{"amount":93.53,"local_amount":4350,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4438.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571557},{"amount":96.1,"local_amount":4470,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4560.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546217},{"amount":99.07,"local_amount":4608,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4701.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714812},{"amount":105.46,"local_amount":4905,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5004.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085138},{"amount":109.82,"local_amount":5108,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5211.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846801},{"amount":112.98,"local_amount":5255,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5361.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661831},{"amount":118.51,"local_amount":5512,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5623.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244615976},{"amount":252.67,"local_amount":11752,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-18T09:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11990.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250831152}],"funded_date":"2011-03-20T19:34:43Z","paid_date":"2012-01-18T09:06:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":286878,"name":"Mhamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mhamad is a 33-year-old man, married with no children, working as a car painter.

Her intent is to increase her inventory so that she has more products to offer her customers.

She runs her business out of her home, and has owned the business for six years. Mar\u00eda began her business out of need to have some economic means of supporting her family. She began with her own money from working abroad. With the money that she could save up, she decided to return to her native country and open a grocery store with a few products such as caramels, soda, eggs, and ham.  This couldn't satisfy the demand of her customers, so she decided to take out a loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000, thus opening a new means of support for herself.

Muava has been in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 550 tala a month.\r\n<p>\r\nMuava joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Having successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 tala, which was used to purchase handicrafts to sell, Muava is now requesting a loan of 2000 tala which will be used to purchase additional handicrafts to sell. This will be her third loan from SPBD. Muava plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Manuel\u2019s youth is his main weapon to survive in life, since his daily work is not just one job but sometimes three jobs at a time. His main income comes from raising and selling animals such as llamas, sheep, chickens, etc.; but in parallel, he helps his sister with handmade fabrics, since he is aware this is an additional income for his family. At night, he borrows his brother-in-law\u2019s moto-taxi and goes out to earn a few \u201csoles\u201d transporting people, with the only objective of improving his family\u2019s finances. What Manuel enjoys most about his work is taking care of his beloved animals; he has been doing this for a year now, and he thinks the most difficult chore is taking the animals to the main fairs of the city. In the future, he expects to continue working hard since his biggest desire is to grow his business and increase his income.\r\nThis is Manuel\u2019s second loan with MFP; he pays on time to avoid problems for the other members of his community bank, where he is well liked for being the youngest in the group. With the five hundred nuevos soles he is requesting, he will buy feed for his animals, since he knows he must feed them well to improve his sales. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":451674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy feed for his animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T00:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734971},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124298},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960039},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992884},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717671},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751357}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T01:02:40Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carlos Morales","image":263787}},{"id":167488,"name":"Ismael's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ismael M. is from the village of Barucboc.

She is 52 years old. Andrea is the leader of a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Andrea N.'s Group.\r\n\r\nAndrea is married. To make a living, Andrea owns and operates a tricycle transport service. (A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached passenger cab.) Andrea has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Andrea joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Andrea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase tires and other accessories. \r\n\r\nAndrea is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to repair her vehicle for better service. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Andrea from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a single mother of an 8 year old son who is in the third grade. The first loan that she got from FINCA Peru was used to increase her capital. She will also use this loan to increase her capital and to begin planting potatoes. \r\n\r\nJulia studied chemical engineering and saw a need in the field of agrochemistry, so she decided to open up her own business when her son was born. Since she started working with FINCA Peru she's been able to work and take care of her son at the same time, because her business was based in her home. Now that her son is older she will be able to have someone else take care of the business at home so that she can leave to work. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about FINCA Peru are her friends, the meetings and the distraction from her daily life. She also likes the fact that FINCA Peru has helped her to save, and thanks to those savings she will be able to buy a car. The trainings that they offer have taught her about familial violence and how to keep it from affecting her life. The months of January - March are the slow season for her business and she is trying to find a way to replace her business during that period.

He has been farming for the past seven years, and this has been generating income for him. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs and tea. His biggest challenges in farming are lack of access to a market for his farm produce, and very poor roads, especially during the rainy season.<br \/><br \/>This Kiva loan will benefit Eustace and his fellow group members, enabling them to purchase \"d.light\" solar lamps. These lamps help to save the money that they would otherwise use to buy kerosene for their lamps. Solar lamps will also save their families the agony of smoke-related ailments, and eye problems caused by poor light. Eustace says that the savings will improve his family\u2019s income, giving them an edge in the current economic hardships."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1620172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase \"d.light\" solar lanterns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eustace","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":44544,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6947.89},{"due_date":"2014-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7131.72},{"due_date":"2014-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7320.4},{"due_date":"2014-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7514.1},{"due_date":"2014-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7712.91},{"due_date":"2014-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7916.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.06},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.28},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.56},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.9},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":758766,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"\u00c2g\u00e9e de 42 ans, Christine a arr\u00eat\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole au niveau secondaire.

To deal with the needs of his family, he managed to open a cafeteria, where he offers quality service to his ever-growing customer base.  And importantly, with this source of revenue, he is able to feed his family.  Famous for the quality and flavor of his coffee, he has achieved all this through personal effort.  Living adjacent to the bus station in Aklakou, Mr. A. had been quick to realize that bus drivers need coffee even very late at night.  With much effort, he gathered a meager sum and then timidly began his business.  Today, after six years of experience, he would like to be able to handle rush hour demands, a challenge he faces daily.   To do so, he is requesting a loan of $1,000 to buy a stove, coffee cups, and other necessities to meet the expectations of his customers.

The boda boda is a motor bike, and it gets its name from boda drivers taking passengers to the border and then another boda driver takes them once they cross the border, hence boda boda.

Cameroon.  He plans to invest this loan in rearing pigs, fishing, and a feed store.  He has used his past loans to support his pig business and fish farm.  He plans to invest most of this loan in the opening of a feed store.  He will reinforce his pig pen, purchase more fish species and ponds, and set up a food store with the money from this loan.  He plans to contribute 200,000 CFA ($400 USD) of his own savings to ensure the success of this loan.\r\n\r\n<p>This will be Peter's fourth loan from GHAPE; he has been a member since 2004.  He has found that there is an increasing demand for both fish and pigs; this loan will help him to meet the demands of those in his community.  He has found that in his community, there are not many 'serious' pig farmers; this makes his pigs in higher demand than those of other farmers.  The introduction of a new fish species will increase demand for fish and encourage others to take up fish farming.\r\n\r\n<p>With the profits from this loan, Peter plans to expand his business and increase the living standard of his family.  He hopes to advance his children's education by paying for their school fees and other expenses.  He also intends to complete his house and install electricity.\r\n\r\n<p>The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

She is 60 years old.  She works and earns for the day-to-day living costs of her family. She is married and blessed with four adult children aged from 30 to 37 years old. Luz wants to secure her future when she is older and still be able to help her grandchildren finish their studies.\r\n<p>Years ago, Luz wanted to earn extra money to help her husband and to send the children to school. Because she lived in a hacienda, a sugarcane plantation, she thought that a general store would be a very convenient business to put up in their area - different items sold at an affordable price and the fastest turnover of capital and income. She invested in a small store to reach her goal of helping her husband. The income from her business was allocated for education, family expenses and additional capital. Business ran smoothly and she was able to expand it. \r\nIn 1995 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to expand her business and to buy additional products to sell. With more capital, her loans had a big impact on her business because she was able to earn more compared to her previous earnings.  Her general store supplies the needs of the hacienda employees which is payable at the end of each week. She earns a minimum of Php 4,000 a month. She saves most of her income for her future and for her grandchildren.\r\n<p>Luz's previous loan of Php 19,000 was used as additional capital for her general store. The said amount was paid every week and fully paid within her loan term without any delay. Her 18th cycle loan of the same amount of Php 19,000 will be used as additional working capital. Income from it will be used for her grandchildren's education.\r\n<p>About NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project  &lt;i&gt;Dungganon&lt;\/i&gt; (a Hiligaynon word that means  &lt;u&gt;Honorable&lt;\/u&gt;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them &lt;i&gt;Dungganon&lt;\/i&gt; -  a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":439368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Lately he has noticed that the video games attract a lot of people mainly young people and children who love spending time being entertained by the different games he offers. This has led him to take the decision of asking INTEGRAL for a loan to invest in the purchase of an LCD screen and a Play Station 3 in order to attract more young people and children who frequent his business most often.

He supports three people and still lives in the home of his wife's parents.  He studied in Bangladesh and has a degree in economics.  He was raised among his family and is the second child.  He had a good childhood since his father was a doctor and made a reasonably good living.  He worked for various companies as an economist, but when his country was invaded and at war he became a refugee in Mozambique in 2000.  When he arrived to Mozambique life was difficult due to the cultural differences and because he had to leave his family behind.  He became friends with others who had come from Asia and through them was able to use the savings brought from his home country to establish as small general store and to marry a young woman from Mozambique.  Among his customers at the store he became friends with a general of the FADM who told him about HLUVUKU.  He decided to apply for a loan to increase the stock of merchandise in his store.  He successfully repaid his first loan.  Now he wants to take out an additional loan to expand his business.  He recently invested in another store and does not have sufficient capital to puchase enough merchandise to stock the store, especially with the increased demand of the holiday season.  Through this business he has gained a lot of good experience and has a vision for the future of his business.  He currently has 8 employees, with an average of 4 children each.  With the earnings from the store he pays his employees' salaries, covers his taxes, reinvests in additional merchandise for the store, and has just enough to cover his daily expenses.  With a loan for 160,000MT he intends to purchase additional basic household goods to stock his stores.  His business has no problem to do this because he owns his own transportation and when he cannot travel to purchase goods for the store he can send one of his employees.  His wife also contributes to the success of their business.  His vision for the future is to expand the business to import\/export products to the north, purchasing beans and peanuts to sell in Maputo and to take basic goods from Maputo to sell in the north.  The business is currently doing well and he is motivated to invest his money to buy a truck for the business.<p><b>\r\n\r\nTranslated by Kiva volunteer Julie Lerch<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nAbdallah Ahmede Razaque, nasceu em bangladesh na cidade de Sylhet a 37 anos aos 09 de Agosto de 1970, sustenta 3 pessoas e reside ainda na casa dos seus sogros, fez o ensino superior onde licenciou se em economia em Bangladesh.\r\nViveu e cresceu num ambiente familiar com os pais e irm\u00e3os, sendo ele o segundo filho.

De acuerdo al \u00e1rea trabajada cobra entre 150 y 300 soles, en ciertas oportunidades le pagan 17 soles diarios. Pero cuando sus propios productos est\u00e1n a punto de ser cosechados se dedica a preparar su carga para que cada fin de semana pueda comercializarlos a diversos mercados. En ciertas ocasiones llegan compradores hasta su chacra y aprovecha en vender por arrobas, que consiste en 12 kilos de pl\u00e1tanos y de ese modo acumula mayores ingresos. A Milton lo llena de regocijo ser agricultor, por eso se propone seguir trabajando duro hasta alcanzar una vida muy c\u00f3moda.

For three years he has lived with his one year old son\u2019s mother.  They live in a wood house that he built himself.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age he has planted cocoa, bananas, and citrus fruit.  Sometimes he works as a field worker for his neighbors.  He does this from four in the morning until midday because later than midday the sun is so intense you cannot work comfortably.  His job is to plow, weed, and clean the farms.  According to the area worked, he charges between 150 and 300 PEN.  Sometimes he is paid 17 PEN a day.\r\n\r\nBut when his own products are ready to be harvested, he works preparing them so that every week end he can sell them to various markets.  Sometimes buyers come to his farm and he takes advantage of selling by \u201carrobas\u201d, which consist of 12 kilos of bananas.  This way he accumulates greater income.\r\n\r\nIt fills Milton with joy to be a farmer.  Therefore, he plans to continue working hard until he reaches a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nThis is his fifth loan with MFP.  In previous loan cycles he has demonstrated responsibility and willingness to pay.  He reiterates the same promise with this loan.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he is asking for he plans to buy ten sacks of fertilizer, which will cost approximately 900-1,000 PEN.  He will use the rest of the money to buy machetes and farming tools. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":342713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-25T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milton","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1522.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992351}],"funded_date":"2009-06-26T01:03:33Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":122173,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicia is a 45-year-old woman; she is divorced with five children who are currently in school.
