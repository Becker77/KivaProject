Group 2 is a diverse sub-group made up of 20 people, all living in the same neighborhood of the Sicap M. district.  Their business deals with a wide range of products.  They have the advantage of multiple years of experience working in their respective businesses.  The Sicap M. group is an affiliate of the Al Ouma association.  They are represented by Ms. Aminata N. who has been a fishseller for the past 12 years. She chose this business in order to make a living through her profits. This group is a member of the Dalifort branch of UIMCEC since February 2011. They are asking for a loan of 2,000,000 FCFA which will be used as working capital by the group members so that they can expand their businesses. The members will use their parts of the loan to buy products such as fish, local products, fabric and others in order to be resold by the different members of the group. Increasing their profits can help them to better handle their personal needs and better contribute to their families\u2019 well-being.\n\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas), Al Ouma has broadened its mission to work with adults as well as children.

Thanks to the concern and support of \u00c1ngel, her ex-partner, for her little daughter, Neyd has been able to open a store selling groceries and other basic products in her home. There she deals with her customers, who for the most part are her neighbors. In the same way, she began a restaurant, where she offers lunches and dinners. \"I cannot complain. The father of my daughter always helps us, in spite of the fact that we are separated,\" Neyd mentions. \"The store is profitable. Every two weeks I go to the city of Pichanaki to buy more supplies. I am earning more or less 40 PEN (about $15) a day,\" she adds. In a few months, she hopes to enlarge and furnish her restaurant, with food service, offering breakfast, lunch, dinner, and perhaps serve a few extra dishes. With the support of her cousin, who cooks, they want to attract customers from their district and even outsiders. \"Everything depends on how hard we work,\" she comments, with a smile that is hopeful and at the same time tender. With your help Neyd will be able to obtain her first loan through MFP, and for this reason she looks courageous, because she knows that with the capital she will be able to begin her journey to self improvement.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback

She lives in the home of her parents, who she hopes to help with household expenses, as she now feels it is time for her to contribute to improving her family's quality of life. Selling shoes has led her to progress in life. The new models she offers have made her the most popular vendor in the market of San Jos\u00e9 (an important market in the city of Juliaca). Her customers always leave very happy and satisfied, for they receive great treatment from Miluska. She has been in this line of work for three years, and what she does not like about it is staying in her stall all day, unable to take time for personal matters. In the future, she would like to have a store where she can sell a greater quantity of shoes, and thus help her parents little by little with their household costs so they won't have to work so much anymore. Miluska hopes to make her repayments punctually. This being her third loan with MFP, she doesn't doubt her ability to do so. She knows that she has the support of her communal bank, and she cares about the well-being of her partners. With the 1,800 soles she is requesting, she will buy more shoes to increase the quantity she can sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":329778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-06T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miluska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990696},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211798},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:01Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641323},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080762},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996902},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":309.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842242}],"funded_date":"2009-06-07T21:45:17Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":117313,"name":"Bobochon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"    MLF \u201cMicroInvest\u201d is one of the leading microfinance organizations, rendering credit services to the population of Tajikistan.

The family lives in their own home in the town of San Francisco, located on the ceja (eyebrow) of the Peruvian jungle.  For more than 20 years she has sold the food typical of her country and of the jungle.  Her customers enjoy very much the taste of these dishes.  Some time ago she installed on the second floor of her home pool tables, which became another source of income for her family.  But the work that she most enjoys is food preparation.  She is saving a portion of her income because she thinks of opening a recreation area for tourists; there is a shortage of recreation areas in her town.  She generally works by herself but occasionally is helped by her husband.  Her work day begins at 7am and lasts until 9 at night, from Monday to Sunday, these being the hours that her market site is open.  This is her seventeenth loan from MFP; she is committed to making payment in a timely and responsible manner.  Also, she is satisfied with her communal bank because of the benefits it provides.  She thinks she will invest this loan in the development of a new plot of land that she purchased.  She wants to build an athletic field, which she believes to have great commercial potential.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":563599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials to build an athletic field ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-06T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":169.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":175.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":181.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":190.47},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":197.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":204.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":211.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":219.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":228.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":233.4},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":242.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":247.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.18},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.26},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.88,"local_amount":169.1,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673525},{"amount":63.23,"local_amount":175.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":178.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887344},{"amount":65.52,"local_amount":182.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":185.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154355},{"amount":68.73,"local_amount":190.93,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":194.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449651},{"amount":70.49,"local_amount":195.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":199.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588360},{"amount":73.45,"local_amount":204.03,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":207.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724853},{"amount":155.36,"local_amount":431.55,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":439.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886526},{"amount":82.52,"local_amount":229.23,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":233.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326857},{"amount":84.28,"local_amount":234.1,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":238.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195405},{"amount":87.71,"local_amount":243.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":248.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269237},{"amount":87.83,"local_amount":243.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":248.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549334}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T00:22:03Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":216497,"name":"Punitai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Punitai T.

Sarlince and her family live in the middle of town, exactly in the village of Naikolan. \r\nSarlince is a persistent woman who is always looking for opportunities to expand her business in the field of sewing. She has been running this business for almost four years. \r\n\r\nSarlince always tries to make innovations in sewing by creating her own models. Although her business is categorized as a small business and can only generate a small income, Sarlince dreams of improving her business to become bigger. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Sarlince is using one sewing machine to fill her customer orders. Sometimes Sarlince receives many orders at a time. She would love to complete all of her customer orders on time with satisfactory quality.  \r\n\r\nTherefore Sarlince hopes she can buy a new sewing machine. The new machine will be used to create button holes and to do other specific work. To make her dream come true, Sarlince is requesting a loan of IDR 4,000,000 from TLM. Sarlince believes that the loan will be a good support for her to improve her

It is fair to say that the decision she took to engage in this business was right as evidenced by the increasing clientele at her pub every evening. That not only means more revenue, but better consolidation of her achievements so far. \r\n\r\nHappy began with an agro sales business. She relied on profits from this business to begin the pub. At the pub, she sells a variety of hard and soft alcoholic beverages. Happy says despite being busy at her pub, she still finds some time, especially on the weekends, to oversee her agro produce sales business. If she does not find time, she says she delegates the running of the business to her brother. \r\n\r\nHappy says with determination, hard work and prayers she will achieve even more than she has achieved now. She says the only limit is the sky. Weekly, this business generates her 120,000 UGX as sales profits.

She divides the risen dough into two parts and mixes one part with water to get it into a porridge-like consistency form, which she cooks until it is firm but not fully cooked.

She and her family own their home.  Thirteen years ago, Zenaida and her husband decided to make use of the inheritances they received from both of their families by establishing a brickyard and using the clay that was available on their land.  The first few years that they were in business were very difficult because they had to hire workers and gained minimal returns.  As the years passed, their business grew as well as their capital.  At the moment, Zenaida hires workers to help make the workload much lighter, which allows her to spend time with her children.  This business helps support several family members and provides for their quality of life.  Zenaida says that one of the factors that has helped her business grow is the availability of her previous loans.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe has already participated in 16 loan cycles with MFP as a member of her group.

He is the old father of eight lovely children. Four of his children are married and live independently, and his other four children are all single. Presently, Kong generates business as a rice farmer located in the Kompong Speu Province of Cambodia. From this business he can earn $1.50 USD each day. To assist his income, two of his children are employed as sewing factory workers in Phnom Penh where they can earn a fixed salary each month. \r\n\r\nDue to the rainy season, Kong would like to purchase seeds, fertilizer and other farming materials but he lacks money so he wishes to request funds through Kiva's partner, HKL.

Little by little, and with much effort, she is achieving this.  Two years ago, Lorenza started a business renting suits and costumes.  She began by leasing a site that was somewhat far from her house, a location that she didn\u2019t last at for more than six months because they raised her rent.  After this, she spent some time offering her goods from a friend\u2019s stall at the market in her area.  However, her friend then reclaimed her location, forcing her to move again.  This time, she was able to obtain a more comfortable site closer to her home that she still has.  She finds her supply of rentals growing, yet her goal for the future is to get a spot in a more commercial area that she can, above all, afford.  For now, she is separated from her husband, and she must cover all her own expenses.  In addition, she is saving money to provide an education for her 18-year old granddaughter, who she supports.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":280672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"For her granddaughter's education and for the purchase of new suits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-04T23:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorenza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":315,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":86.15,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084950},{"amount":73.61,"local_amount":71.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":73.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978430},{"amount":162.51,"local_amount":157.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":162.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439318}],"funded_date":"2009-03-04T23:33:23Z","paid_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":96849,"name":"Natalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Natalia tiene 26 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo en casa de su suegra.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Takhmina is an enterprising woman. She is married and has two children. Her husband is a taxi driver and, as his salary has not been stable, sometimes they have accumulated debts. To help her husband, Takhmina decided to start her own business designing and making national dresses for women. She began her business after her first child was born and started with a small machine that she already owned. Now, she has a small workshop and two employees that help her cover the demands of her clients. The good service and fine quality she offers has made her business grow into a small company. Takhmina wants a loan of US$ 1500 to buy a sewing machine and material to help fill her customers\u2019 orders. She promises to return the loan in 12 months. The loan will help her business grow and improve the quality of life for this family. Takhmina sincerely thanks you for your help. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 47 years old, married, and has three adult children. To make a living, Nora owns and operates a mini-restaurant. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from serving a variety of different meals to customers, such as chicken, pork adobo, afritada, and  caldereta, in the local community. Nora has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. This loan will be Nora's first loan from HSPFI.

They are her reason for living and they live together in the town of Uni\u00f3n Autiki. It was very hard for her to achieve financial security.  She shares that she managed to get two agricultural plots with a lot of hard work and effort.  There she works hard farming coffee and plantains, because she knows she is dependent upon the harvest for her earnings.  She has 8 years of experience farming and her favorite part of the job is selling her products in the city of Pichanaki, as it provides concrete evidence of her labors. She also takes advantage of her trips to the city to buy food and clothing for her daughters.  Her goal is to start her own business and in that way, earn a little extra money.  She has already taken the first step by starting her own sweets shop, where she is having a lot of success.  However, she lacks the capital for her business.  This is why she began to work with this group of women in the loan group.  She is certain that she will be able to make her little store one that is well-stocked and offer more products.

During harvest time and weeding, she has to hire day laborers in order to get the work done more quickly.  \r\n\r\nRuth needs the support of the financial institution to carry on her work.  She needs to maintain her crops and purchase manure to care for her coffee plants, so she came to the lending institution MFP, which helps low-income people who want to improve themselves.

Salome M. is 29 years old. She is married and has three children, aged 3, 6 and 9.  She also has one other dependent, her brother in-law. In 2005, Salome established a salon business. Salome now requires a  loan in order to purchase salon equipment and cosmetics. \r\n\r\n<P>\r\nAbout SELFINA <P>\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing.

She is divorced, with seven children. Only one child is in school. Margaret sells frozen food; she also buys dried fish and smoked fish from middlemen and fishmongers, and resells it in the local market.  Margaret has been in this business for fifteen years.  She says income is very low since she pays high rent on the store from which she operates.

Each month her husband sends her at least 400-500 somoni for living expenses, therefore Marifat turned to MicroInvest with confidence, knowing that she could repay the loan without difficulty.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":301611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Raising and selling cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov, Tajikistan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-12T09:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marifat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":623.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084615},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":623.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000836}],"funded_date":"2009-04-13T21:55:02Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":105057,"name":"Shamsullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamsullo is 46 years old and the father of four children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is from the village of Montol, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. He is 40 years old. Crisanto is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Crisanto owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Crisanto has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Crisanto joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Crisanto has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Crisanto is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase fertilizers. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Crisanto from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Kou sells used clothes, and plans to use her portion of this 30,000 LRD group loan to buy more stock for her business.  Kou is 33 years old and married with four children ages 1, 8, 11, and 19.  Kou's school-age kids attend elementary school and junior high.  Kou says that she was never able to go to school due to a lack of support from her parents.  Besides her children, Kou also helps care for three siblings.\r\n\r\nKou has been running her used clothing business for about eight years now, and sells from a table near the Coal Field Poultry Market.  She says she started her endeavor with one bag of clothes, and has built her business since then.  According to Kou, the biggest challenge she faces is stiff competition -- many people in her area also sell used clothes.  Kou hopes that one day she'll be able to grow her business enough so she can open a proper storefront.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Kou is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

It has become a very profitable business, with many people coming during the week for the incomparable flavour of the exotic dishes she cooks, and so their income has increased slowly but steadily.

Ver\u00f3nica sells traditional street snacks.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that she started this business because in the village where she lives there isn't anyone who sells food in the afternoons and she likes to prepare food.  She will use the loan that she is requesting to buy supplies like oil, salt, tomatoes, napkins, plates, utensils and chilies to prepare her dishes.   \r\n\r\nShe provides for her children with the earnings from the business and helps her husband with the household expenses and the education of their children.  \r\n\r\nShe says that her business is beneficial to her community as well, since she is the only person that sells prepared food here.   Now, the people that don't have time or the desire to prepare food, can buy her food.   \r\n\r\nHer goal is to give her children a quality education so that they can have a good profession and a better future.  She also wants to set up a permanent local so that she can generate more income.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that all the other members in the group are responsible people that fulfill their obligations.  They like to work to overcome and excel given any difficulty.  Since they have known each other for a long time, they are committed to repaying their loan.

His spouse is Elizabeth K. and she has formal employment.\r\n\r\nJames is a businessman running a shop in Narok town. He sells blankets, bed sheets, wall curtains and materials for making clothes to the tailors who are his frequent customers. He has been in this business for the last nine years.\r\n\r\nHe learned about KADET through a friend who was already a registered member in KADET.

A pleasant mannered man, operating his own taxi has fulfilled Rafi\u2019s long term desire to be self-employed. He offers good service to his customers and tries to give them an enjoyable ride. Rafi has been in business for about eight years. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 8,000 TJS to help purchase spare parts for his car. We are happy for this opportunity to help Rafi improve his business and continue his success. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She\u2019s 50 years old and is in a common law relationship.  From this relationship she has two adult children; one of them still lives with her.  Her husband is a seafood merchant.\r\n\r\nShe has a small eatery in Santa Ana\u2019s market where she prepares a variety of dishes; she sells breakfasts and lunches.  She works daily from 5am until 1pm with help from her daughter.  She tells us that she started in this locale this year because she used to sell the food at her house.  She used the previous loan to equip her locale and now she\u2019s doing much better.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy products needed to prepare her dishes and part of it will be used to buy fish for her husband\u2019s business.  \r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the communal bank and she likes it because the loans are a great help.

D., aged 40, and Mr. Nguyen Van Thanh, aged 41, not only live in harmony but also are good at doing business. They have a corn business where she sells corn kernel and corn mash wholesale and retail. Normally he operates a milling machine to grind corn kernel, yet when their customers want to have corn delivered to their house, he can ride a rickshaw or drive a motor-cart to transport corn. From this business they earn about $12.5 a day. In addition, they have a rice field of 700m2. You may wonder how they can manage everything. The answer is simple and easy to understand.

Marifat used to sell clothes on markets, but now she works as a sales woman in a department store. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \"\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437\"  \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0422\u043e\u0445\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0448\u044c\u0435\u0442. \u041c\u0443\u044f\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440 \u0438 \u0425\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439, \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446 2 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c. \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430  \u0425\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u044b\u043d. \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0442  \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435, \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0439."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":96538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Clothing Sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2007-12-14T01:40:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marifat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mavluda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azizova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hosiyat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-29T17:51:44Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3647,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":729.4},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":729.4},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":729.4},{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":729.4},{"due_date":"2008-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":729.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":215,"local_amount":729.4,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":743.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116470},{"amount":215,"local_amount":729.4,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":743.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136303},{"amount":215,"local_amount":729.4,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":743.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159024},{"amount":215,"local_amount":729.4,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":743.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183785},{"amount":215,"local_amount":729.4,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-16T09:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":743.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211348}],"funded_date":"2007-12-15T17:51:44Z","paid_date":"2008-05-16T09:04:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":31322,"name":"Kazinga A (I) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet is 33 years old.

Now that he's getting older he feels a little nostalgic about never forming his own family, and he often feels that his work is meaningless, and not worth all the sacrifice.  At the same time, he thanks God for giving him a good sister and nieces and nephews that help and support him with his crops.  He grows peas, corn, and a few potatoes in his community's public fields, as well as in some of his own which he has acquired in his years as a farmer.  Felix is happy to work the land because his crops sometimes earn him a lot of money, but there are also bad times in which the low price of his crops means he earns very little.  Like now, with the corn price so low he doesn't bother harvesting it, instead preferring to leave it in the fields so it ages, dries into corncobs, which he later breaks down and sells as dry corn.  This is the only way for him to recover the money he has invested in this crop.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFelix is very happy to be a client of MFP, and has already taken out 8 loans.  In all this time he as demonstrated himself to be punctual with his loan payments, and promises to do the same with this loan.  The money he is asking for is to buy higher quality pea seeds (special seeds that are better for the climate) that give him a very good harvest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun

Ilhomiddin was born in 1973 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He is married and responsible for four people including his wife and three children.\r\n<p>\r\nVery dynamic, serious, and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his flock and repair his enclosure, so as to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, who buy animals from more than 20 km from his village.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this goal in mind, Ilhomiddin is requesting a loan that will serve him as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also to make some investments.\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the peaceful town of Jala-jala, in the province of Rizal, Philippines.  She has no children, but she really longs for them.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though she has no children, she is still determined to have a source of income, aside from her husband's farming income.  In 2001, she happily joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. When she received her first loan, she invested it in the resale of charcoal as her primary business.  She is also involved in fishing and farming, both as secondary businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nAs the years pass, she has noticed that her investment in the resale of charcoal is getting better, and it is providing her with good income.  She buys the charcoal from the charcoal maker and resells it in their village.  Now on her tenth loan, she proposes a loan of 20,000 Philippine Pesos as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for two hundred sacks of charcoal for resale, and also its transportation expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nShe dreams of expanding her business so that she can save for their future, and be able to build a more spacious and durable house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":381064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

Another difficulty is not having sufficient income to pay the workers in advance for their support at harvest time.  So she depends on loans through the MFP institution.  Her top priority now is to plant more cocoa and coffee on her 2 hectares of uncultivated land.  This is her eighth loan through MFP.  She feels the loan is very helpful in getting ahead in her work.  She is a very beloved member of her communal bank.

She is single, 46 years old, has 4 sons, and finished the 6th grade. She grew up with her parents and siblings, went to school, and in her free time helped with household chores. She also had the privilege of learning to be a seamstress from her aunt, which enabled her to make clothing articles to order as way of helping her family. In the 1980s Lucrecia married and moved to the neighborhood of Benfica in Maputo. Years later she and her husband separated, and she and two of her sons moved to the 25 de Junho neighborhood. <p>\r\nIn 1992, Lucrecia took on work as a seamstress in a boutique. In 2001 she moved to Khongolote to a lot loaned by her brother, where for the last seven years she has run a shop selling a range of products. The shop opens at 8:00 a.m. and closes at 9:30 p.m. Products are purchased in Maputo, and Lucrecia rents a car to transport the goods. <p>\r\nLucrecia learned about Hluvuku through a client at her shop. With her loan of 16,000 MT she intends to purchase rice, sugar, wheat flour, corn flour, oil, drinks, and soft drinks. She currently employs one worker who helps in her absence and on busy days. The most productive periods are the summer months, the weekends, and the ends of the months. Her daily revenue is 1,500 MT, and the products that generate the most profit are drinks and soft drinks. Lucrecia keeps a record book of products coming in and going out, as well as existing stock. The monthly profit margin is 6,000 MT, which she uses to support her family, build her house, and increase business. <p>\r\nLucrecia is very happy with her loan because it helped her increase her business and improve the appearance of her shop. <p> <b> Translated from Portuguese by Jill Haring, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLucr\u00e9cia Paulo N., solteira maior de 46 anos de idade, nasceu na

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

T. is a 19-year-old pepper producer who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Isaac is a dedicated producer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of Cayenne peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting \u2013 working the land as needed. The land they work is their own.\r\n\r\n In addition to his agricultural activity, Isaac spends some days working as a labourer in the nearby orange producing factory in order to supplement the family income, but this work is sporadic. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and buys food. The rural zone where Isaac and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Isaac is working hard for the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Isaac and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole. This loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Isaac with the help of his family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Isaac will need roughly one year before his peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest. \r\n\r\nThe main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity for Isaac, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, there is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Isaac wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighbourhood. \r\n \r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":555658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of seeds and nutrients necessary for the production of peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":31971.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":32504.49},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33046.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33597},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":34156.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":34723.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":212463,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine (pictured with her 2-year-old child) is a hard-working farmer from the town of Litein in Rift Valley Kenya.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She said that they named the group this because this is the name of the road that goes by her house and ends in the archeological ruins of Zirahuato. Mrs. Hilda is 46 years old. She has studied in secondary school but she didn\u2019t finish her studies because the preparatory school is far from her house and she didn\u2019t have the money to pay for transportation. Mrs. Hilda is well known among her friends and neighbors. She sells clothes such as blouses, pants for children and men, bathing suits, etc. She has been doing this business for the past fifteen years. She sells her clothes in different places such as Zirahuato and Benito Juarez. She sells her clothes to friends and acquaintances that pay her in payments or by demand. She started this business as a way to help her husband with the family\u2019s expenses.  She buys the clothes at different outlets in Toluca City in the state of Mexico. One of the difficulties that she has is that her customers pay her in payments but they don\u2019t always pay their payments and she looses the money. Mrs Hilda is married to Mr. Benito who has a small farm where he grows avocados, peaches and also cultivates gladiola flowers. They have four children, all of which are married. Her goal is to open a clothing business in her home that can be open daily. \r\nMr. Gildardo is part of the group called \u201cCamino Real\u201d.  He is originally from Puntecillas, a place that is close to the archeological ruins of Zirahuato. He is 49 years old and has completed his studies up to the third year of secondary school. He didn\u2019t finish his studies because he had to help his parents as they had other children to support. Mr. Gil is known for his friendships. He is asking for this loan, from Fundacion Real, for the maintenance and repair of his taxi. He has been driving a taxi for fourteen years. He likes this job as he gets to know many people and places in the country. One of the difficulties that he has is that there is a lot of competition and sometimes he doesn\u2019t earn a lot. His wife helps with the household expenses. The other problem that he has had is that he had an accident and his taxi was damaged. He needs to have it repaired, as it is the way he earns a living. Mr. Gil is married to Maria Ortega who is a kindergarten teacher. They have four children, three of which are married. None of the children live with them. Their daughter, Yoselin, studies at the university in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n. Mr. Gildardo\u2019s goal is to have a small farm where he can grow avocados so that he has another source of income. He wants his daughter to have a good career that can support her when she grows up. The other members of \u201cCamino Real\u201d are named Eloy and Mariela. They will invest their loan money in buying fruits and vegetables and buying groceries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":738594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothes for women, men and children ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-29T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eloy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gildardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1582.69},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1672.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1708.4},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1745.26},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1821.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1860.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1900.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1941.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1983.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.74},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.86},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.06},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.31},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.09,"local_amount":1582.69,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292517},{"amount":286.42,"local_amount":3380.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160782},{"amount":453.23,"local_amount":5349.55,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5428.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233656},{"amount":318.68,"local_amount":3761.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3817.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512475},{"amount":332.58,"local_amount":3925.54,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3983.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223129}],"funded_date":"2011-03-31T02:53:10Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":290323,"name":"Hussein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

Clients visit him and have healthy fun, doing aerobics or dancing a wide repertoire of musical styles that Efrain himself dances very well and leads as an instructor.  The clients who visit his business dance to lose weight or simply to relax and escape their daily lives for a while.\r\n\r\nEfrain's business is constantly improving thanks to the fact that his clients feel very happy and comfortable with this activity.

But you'd never guess the size of the city from its tranquil pace of life. Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas is in a tropical, humid area of Ecuador, renowned for its natural beauty, huge markets and its trade in livestock - the largest in the country.\r\n\r\nBertha lives in her own home with her partner Marco and their two children. Bertha is 39 years old, and her children are 3 and 12. Marco works for a public utilities company, which keeps him busy all day, thus Bertha works alone in her business operating a clothing store. Bertha shares her free time with her children.\r\n\r\nThis is Bertha's second loan this year from Kiva's partner, Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa. She will use the loan to buy more merchandise to sell.
