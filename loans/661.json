K\u1ef7 is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02-Ho\u1eb1ng Tr\u01b0\u1eddng 2-Ho\u1eb1ng H\u00f3a  (40102).\r\n\r\nK\u1ef7 is married and has 4 adult children.  To making a living, K\u1ef7 operates a family member's business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling wild-caught fish in the local community.  K\u1ef7 has been engaged in this business for over 30 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, K\u1ef7 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  K\u1ef7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  This will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  K\u1ef7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

He has been building his house little by little and currently wishes to build a bedroom so that when his children grow they will have a bit more privacy.

With 45,000KGS in initial capital, he managed to turn his farm into a successful establishment with two horses, fifteen sheep, five goats, and a cow. Thanks to profits from managing the business, Karagul was able to help his children get their own houses. Nowadays, Karagul has income from selling milk and meat products on the order of 15,000KGS per month. \r\n\r\nKaragul has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000KGS to buy two calves so he can increase his earnings, which he plans to use to do repairs on his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":872091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chet -

The above picture presents Rosemary, a mother of 11 who has been practicing agriculture for the last 5 years. Because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect among other farmers and she is viewed as a mentor in her village. She lives together with her children in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is known for maize farming. Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income through selling harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. Availability of labour is a major challenge for Rosemary. She also keeps a dairy cow. Before joining Juhudi, Rosemary could not access loans from banks since she is a woman and also a smallholder farmer. She joined Juhudi Kilimo and learnt about loan management and agribusiness.

With the consecutive loans he received from Majmoua, he expanded his business and improved the living conditions and quality of life of his family.

Be an important part of the well-being of this young and noble family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has worked as a docent in the Diriangen School for 20 years.  This client has two children.  The eldest is 17 years old, or of school age, and is in his fifth year of secondary education.  The younger daughter is 14 years old, and she is in her third year of secondary education.  This client is known for being responsible, honest, and hardworking.  Her husband is a businessmen who travels to the area of the Municipality Nueva Guinea to buy livestock with a brother.  They share the family\u2019s household expenses, and they are a family of few resources but they are very tight-knit.  This loan would be repaid in two years and so little by little to go on improving their home.  They live in the area San Antonio in a neighbourhood where each day the population is increasing.  Her dream is to go on improving her home with each loan that they get with AFODENIC, to have work stability, health, and that her children continue studying so that they may do something with their lives.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva

T. (0) is a 35-year-old woman living in the town of Pitonuu.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Malama owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Malama has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 200 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Malama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Malama is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Malama is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Malama plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Her husband is a workman for the \u201cZona Franca\u201d (a governmental organization that regulates exportation from Nicaragua).  His salary is low, but he has a great desire to save to build his own house.  She has worked as a teacher at a neighborhood school for two years.  She studied as an engineer in computer systems.  Thanks to her father (her mother abandoned them when she was little), who sacrificed much, she finished high school.  She had to work as a domestic employee to be able to pay for her education, and she went to school on Saturdays.  Then she worked for the Zona Franca to be able to pay the university because her father had few economic resources.  It is difficult, but she did it.  You have to have a lot of will power and the desire to succeed.  Her goal is to be able to find a better job where she will be able to practice her profession.  That way she would earn more and be able to start building her house.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy rocks, sand, and metal to go forward and start.  Everything is expensive, and it is difficult to build all at once.

She has a business selling food in her home every night.  In addition to this, she also is a traveling saleswoman of new and used clothing.  She started to work in this business ten years ago, due to a lack of work.  Also, her mother had previously sold food out of her home, and this served as the inspiration for her business.

He has had his colmado for nine years, which he started with some savings. He is planning to use this loan to invest in his business by purchasing rice, beans, canned food, sugar and flour. He will use the profits to invest his business and improve it. He says that his most difficult challenge was working hard after he had an accident and broke a leg. He plans to continue playing dominoes in his free time.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because he needed capital for his business and some neighbors invited him to join the group.

Her greatest difficulty in life was having a partner who was abusive.  This resulted in their separation and Julia having to start a new life with her four children.  Her greatest accomplishment has been to rise above this by starting her own business and building her own home.  She tells us that she is happy these days because her business, where she sells wigs, gifts, and cell phones, is doing so well.  She also tells us that her business, which she began with the equivalent of only $25 USD, has grown a great deal thanks to the first loan she obtained through the Manuela Ramos Group.  At this point she has been able to invest $15,900 USD in her store and merchandise.  With this loan of $975, which she will pay back in four installments, she will purchase games and toys for the Christmas season.

Basbaatar, with his wife, moved to the capital a few years ago. Since the move, he has been running a small retail business in the Narantuul market, the largest outdoor market in Ulaanbaatar. With his wife, Basbaatar sells women's and men\u2019s clothing at the stall that he rents in the Narantuul market.

She believes that one can do anything in life with effort and dedication.

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":129389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She offers the service of making blankets, sofa covers, sheets and also wool sweaters and wholesale thread.  She specializes in both categories, sewing and weaving because sewing provides her with income during the summer months and weaving in the winter.

They are currently living in her mother-in-law\u2019s house.  She studied the profession of agronomy.  Once she graduated she made plans to plant numerous hectares in her town of Huasahuasai, which is called \u201cThe seedbed of Peru\u201d.  \r\n\r\nShe worked on this project together with her father and her husband, who offer her all of the support possible.  They planted various fields of potatoes, and potato prices were favorable at the time.  From then on she sent every harvest to the wholesale market in Lima, where it generated better earnings.  She used the earnings to get a car.  They were boom years.\r\n\r\nBut, since she had a pregnancy and delivery that were high risk, she decreased her planting.  She then decided to set up a store in her mother-in-law\u2019s house in order to get more money for her household.  Meanwhile, her husband continues to work with his car transporting products from La Merced (forest in Jun\u00edn) to Lima.  Now, her husband has suggested buying some land and building their own house soon.\r\n\r\nThis is Milca\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  She was the president of her community bank for the last three previous periods.  But, she had to leave her post because they moved to another place that is farther away.  But, she attends the meetings punctually, and she helps with the collections.  Milca is very honest and upright.  She watches over her colleagues\u2019 savings, and she patiently guides them to use their money wisely.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is now asking for to buy chemical fertilizers.  With the other part of the money she will buy food products to stock her store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":343819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-27T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717165}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T21:46:02Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":122689,"name":"Nyame Ye Baako Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farouk is forty-one years old.

The region of Temuco is known for its natural springs and its native and eye-catching flora and fauna.<P>\r\n\r\n\u201cLos Esforzados de Nueva Imperial\u201d is comprised of 22 persevering members.  The main activities of its members are the manufacturing and sale of various products, such as fabric, clothing, earrings, necklaces, wooden utensils, cooked food such as empanadas (folded and stuffed pastries), ice, and ice cream.  There are also members who sell medicinal herbs and a member who runs a service center of telephone booths.<P>\r\n\r\nThis village bank\u2019s president is Pedro, who is pictured above in the center of the photo wearing a white shirt.  He is an artisan who works with wood, making a range of items including kitchen utensils, earrings, brooches, yokes, and wagons.  He sells these items in a shopping mall and various local markets with permission from the municipal government, similar to the other members of the village bank.  With the loan, Pedro would like to purchase an electric saw to help him grow his production.  His hope is to remodel his 59-year-old home where he lives with his mother, and his dream is to one day export his products to grow his sales.  <P>\r\n\r\nFor Pedro, Fondo Esperanza has meant great economic help for his business, because thanks to prior loans, he was able to purchase a copy machine and a key copier, which allowed him to offer more services and secure more economic stability.  The rest of the members of \u201cLos Esforzados de Nueva Imperial\u201d also plan to invest their loans in machines and merchandise so that they can continue growing and reaching their personal

business. She lives in Sitio Kabangkalan, Brgy. Daan Lungsod, Toledo City, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general-store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).  \r\n\r\nWennie is now borrowing PHP 25,000 so that she  could use it as additional working capital. This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Wennie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dunhhanon(a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\nIvy operates a computer rental shop. In the Philippines, very few people own their own computers. Therefore there is a need for computers, especially for students who need to do research and write papers. Ivy rents out computers by the hour and offers printing and typing services. Aside from this she also sells electronic cell phone loads. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. Ivy earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) every day.\r\nTo help Ivy continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy computer parts, software and electronic loads for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\nIvy hopes to add more computer units in her shop. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Three of the kids are girls who, together with Hurmatvi, sew izori, a type of pants made out of warm fabrics and worn as part of the national costume. Hurmatvi then sells the izori at the Korvon market in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan. During her own childhood, Hurmatvi had helped her grandmother to make national Tajik clothes. Nowdays, since her own family was forced to find additional income as there is not enough money for family needs, Hurmatvi taught her daughters this craft and now they all sew izori for sale.

Two year later, she had her second.  She always wanted to have a business, and this is why she never gave up the idea of being able to study something and starting a business.  Two years ago, when her sons were a little older, she made the decision to study cosmetology at a beauty school.  After some months, she fixed up a space in her home and opened a salon with the little money she had then.  Throughout two years, she worked hard to be able to finish constructing a location to move to.  Now she works in a bigger location that she has gradually implemented over the years and where, for six years, she has dedicated a space to her bookstore.  She invests what she receives from these two businesses into the higher education of her sons.  Luckily, her husband, who works in a mechanic shop, supports her in everything.  Today, Lucy's objective is to continue growing her salon and to sell cosmetic products wholesale in the future.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nA los veinticinco a\u00f1os Lucy tuvo a su primer hijo, dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s tuvo al segundo.

Now she will have to take charge of her husband's farm, but she is worried because she will not be able to take care of her animals. Elsa tell us they mainly sow potatoes and that with the profits of all these years of work they were able to buy their house, acquire their own farming lots and especially  educate their children. Whereas the food expenses were covered by the sales of pork, and when they didn't have enough they would sell the cows for 800 or 1000 soles( $250-315), depending on the race. And when the cow produced milk she would make and sell cheese.

V., 20 years old, joined ASHI early in 2009 to be able to have access to credit for starting a business. A variety store was the first business she thought she knew how to run and could augment the income her husband is earning from being a cook of one eatery in their town. However, Jocelyn was not able to control people crediting from her store, therefore, her business towards the end of her loan lost its capital.  Through the financial support of her husband, she was able to pay back her loan on time and have another business, eight months ago, which is hog fattening. \r\nWith the hog fattening business, Jocelyn profits as much double the amount of her capital after only four months of raising the pig. For the second time with ASHI, Jocelyn is requesting a loan which she will use for financing her hog fattening (pig raising) business. The more pigs she will raise and sell, the more profit she will be making. As they don\u2019t have children yet, she wants to prepare financially for a time when they will have

Her early marriage and motherhood pushed her capabilities in running a small business. She had no other way to change her life, as well as her two children\u2019s lives, as she depended on her husband\u2019s small income as a motorcycle technician. She is not even a graduate of college (because she came from a poor family) to be employed in offices or have a better paying job. Because of that, Maricel opened her eyes to see more options for having her own income; hence, she thought of her skill in cooking food. She thought that maybe, selling food as her business would provide her an income which she could use to augment her husband\u2019s. \r\n\r\nWhen she became a member of ASHI, the loan she received was used to start her envisioned business. She gained a lot of customers from the neighborhood and even from other villages. After six months, she had fully repaid her loan and had improved their life a little. Her second loan, with a much larger amount, enhanced further her business; however, to fully achieve her dream of having a restaurant, she needs more loans. Therefore, after just recently paying off her second loan, Maricel is again requesting a loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos. This will be used for the same purpose. Some of the proceeds of her business will be spent for obtaining her family\u2019s basic needs, while some will be saved for her two children, whose ages are 2 and

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Negros Occidental. She operates 2 business ventures: fishing and farming. Her husband, Felix A., who is 59 years old, works as a fisherman and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children aged between 30 and 35. \r\n\r\nTessie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Tessie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, thus lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000. She intends to use this to buy materials for her fishing boat so that she can continue to save for the future improvement of business. Tessie A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In his business, he has the support of his workers who take charge of loading and weighing each product by the kilogram.  They use his vehicle to travel to different communities in search of produce.  Once he has amassed a good quantity of produce, he transfers it to well-known trading companies who pay him a good quantity of money annually.\r\n\r\nWinter brings rainy periods and landslides on the roads.

At the time, she only had one stand, but through the loans she received and savings she accumulated, she was eventually able to expand and buy the stand next door.

Zacarias","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente is 23 years old and originally from the Gaza Province. He is single and has no children. In 1991, Vicente and his family moved to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, because of the Mozambican civil war. In 1999 Vicente lost his parents in an accident and has ever since supported his 3 sisters. He lives in his late father\u2019s house and supports his 2 younger sisters who are still in school. His older sister already works, but barely makes her own living.\r\n<p>\r\nVicente studied until 10th grade and then did a professional course of 2 years to become a teacher. Since 2004 Vicente has been working as a teacher, currently teaching Portuguese and music to 6th and 7th graders. Vicente works from 12:00pm to 17:20pm and earns a monthly salary of MTn 4,500. The government adjusts the salary every year, and this time it will be increased by 11%.    \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Vicente\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva. The first loan of MTn 5,500, in May 2007, was used to install energy in his house and pay the initial contract with the state-owned energy company. The second MTn 4,000 was used to help him pay for his graduation from the professional course to become a teacher. This time Vicente plans to use the MTN 11,500 to buy construction materials, such as cement and sand, to repair his house. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore he took the first loan he approached a few other institutions such as the local bank, but preferred Hluvuku because it offered the flexibility to pay as much as he could each month, and over a longer period. Vicente is very grateful for Hluvuku\u2019s loans, as he has really felt a positive impact on his life after the loans.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Vicente would like to go to university. He tried to enter this year, but was not accepted after sitting for the entrance annual exam. He will try again next year, as he dreams of studying psychology. Vicente would like to structure his life before forming a family, so that he can provide better for his children than his parents were able to provide."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":161534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Cuando empez\u00f3 su labor como comerciante no ten\u00eda la capacidad adquisitiva para hacerlo, pero tuvo mucha fe en que las cosas mejorar\u00edan y fue as\u00ed, ya que pas\u00f3 de ser ambulante a tener un puesto propio donde vender. Dejo de visitar el mercado de su distrito y rodearlo, para ubicarse en un puesto agradable donde puede vender sus productos tranquilamente e incrementar sus ventas.

One of the things she was able to offer them, apart from her love and attention, is a house of their own where they can live like a happy family. When she began selling things to earn money, she didn't have the purchasing power to do much, but she had a lot of faith that things would get better -- and they did. She went from being a street vendor to having her own space. She stopped going to the local market and set up in a pleasant space where she can sell her products in peace and increase her sales. Now she is convinced that every sacrifice is repaid and because of that wishes to continue working every day from 9 in the morning to 8 at night, happily tending her shop. Maria is assisted by her daughter, who watches the shop while Maria prepares food in the morning. That's how she's been able to continue selling toys for more than 10 years. A sense of comradeship and a desire to improve one's life are two of the qualities she likes about her communal bank, since the members have given her a lot of support for her social and economic development with the 18 previous loans she's gotten from Microfinanzas PRISMA. She plans to use the 3000 soles requested to increase the quantity of toys she sells to meet her little customers' demands, since most of them are children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":343882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-28T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":448.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":465.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":486.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":533.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":556.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.59},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.24},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":149.59,"local_amount":448.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":457.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211934},{"amount":155.03,"local_amount":465.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":473.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641462},{"amount":162.24,"local_amount":486.72,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":495.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080901},{"amount":169.79,"local_amount":509.37,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":518.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997043},{"amount":177.69,"local_amount":533.07,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":542.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842384},{"amount":185.66,"local_amount":556.97,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":567.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733952}],"funded_date":"2009-06-28T19:48:19Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":122721,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa se\u00f1ora  Luz., pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Totoritas\u201d  que esta ubicado en la Comunidad de Chimu, el distrito de Puno, Provincia de Puno, Departamento de Puno, ella tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil casada, y es madre de 5 hijos  (dos a su cargo).

Elma is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elma from ASKI.

P., 61, originally from Bucaramanga, also known as the city of parks, is a great entrepreneur who lives in the Granada de Malambo neighborhood, part of Barranquilla\u2019s metropolitan area.  He is a cobbler, as are many of his neighbors in this area, who manufacture shoes and sports sandals which are then sold in small stores.\r\n\r\nGustavo became aware of the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo through two close neighbors who are clients.  He is asking for funding in the amount of $1.500.000 to buy materials and supplies like: 500 pairs of insoles, 50 meters of synthetic shoe leather and supplies such as adhesives and thread.\r\n\r\nGustavo learned this skill, a family tradition, precisely in his father\u2019s workshop when he was about to finish high school.  When he turned 21, after having worked for a year in a shoe manufacturing firm, he used is severance pay to set up his own business.  He started out with just one motor and 12 shoe molds.  A year later, he moved to Venezuela to run his own firm where he grew to have 45 employees.\r\n\r\nThe situation became complicated and the crisis in the neighboring country became acute to such an extent that he had to close his factory and move to the city of M\u00e9rida where he began to make custom order shoes.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 he returned to Colombia and settled in Malambo near his family; he set up a workshop with three employees and he\u2019s now in the process of expanding because his experience and the quality of his products has made it possible for him to start collaborating with large, well-known shoe stores in Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to position himself with the large chain department stores so he has all the legal permits for his business.  His greatest challenge was facing the crisis the recession in Venezuela produced but he has always been prepared to continue fighting to get ahead in life and to start over again as he\u2019s now doing in Malambo.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva
