The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

In the near future their ambition is to diversify the dishes that they cook for sale. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":232961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of raw materials for food service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Louise ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Solo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamy                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":333333.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":335407.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889498},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889499},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135658},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033459},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620826}],"funded_date":"2009-01-02T23:20:54Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":81389,"name":"Yong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yong S., a villager in Thom Village in Kandal Province, is a farmer who cultivates both rice and vegetables.

It is a town with affable, happy people and strong commercial activity.  She is an active woman who is part of the Junta de Acci\u00f3n Communal in the area.  She is a delegate to the Association that governs the community structures in the city.  She started working as a businesswoman in the popular neighborhood of Montes over five years ago.  During that time she connected with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in the hopes of getting business training and a loan to sell products by catalog.  From that time on the Foundation has given her four loans.  They were gradually increased as they were reimbursed.  Two years ago she took advantage of the opportunity of having a more stable business.\r\n\r\nHer brother, because of travel, gave her a place in rental condition outfitted with display cases and shelves but without merchandise.  She set up a drugstore with variety items at this place.  The Mario Santo Domingo Foundation gave her the second loan for 1,5000,000 COP, which was to be repaid in 12 months.  When the drugstore was stocked, her earnings started to increase very quickly.  Her volume of sales required her to devote herself completely to this activity.  This experience has strengthened her business performance.  Her capacity to observe and the permanent formation of her business have allowed her to identify a potential market for paper products.  She is planning to direct her strategy towards increasing her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe will use 50% of her next loan for 2,300,000 COD for common allopathic medicine, dietary supplements, toiletries, and hygiene products.  She will use the other 50% to buy stationery items like pencils, cardboard, sheets of paper, pens, folders, highlighters, notebooks, agendas, memos, pencil sharpeners, newspapers, binders, CDs, cards, and office sets.  This is her merchandise plan for now.\r\n\r\nEsperanza\u2019s life conditions have notably improved.  Through her efforts she has been able to support her only child, and he has been able to study music at the Atl\u00e1ntico University.  He is her greatest motivation.  Her immediate dream is that he becomes a professional.  \r\n\r\nHer next challenge is to expand her business by renting the location next to her business.  She still lives in her father\u2019s house.  She is separated, and her parents need her company.  She worries constantly about innovation and adjusting to the market\u2019s requirements.  She always attempts to offer her customers the seasonal requirements.  She knows perfectly the seasonal conditions for each group of products that she sells.  Her offers are governed by the peaks of seasonal customer demand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Mar\u00eda Luisa and consists of thirteen members who are working parents who strive relentlessly to support their families through their businesses.  They are responsible and cooperative people who have demonstrated in their previous six loan cycles that they are capable of working together.  Now that they have had the chance to get to know each other well through their hard work, they look forward to continuing together as a group.  Among the retail businesses represented are the sale of food, handmade dresses, clothing, soft drinks, bread, groceries, cosmetics, and empanadas.  The men are engaged in the repair of air conditioners, refrigerators, and other appliances.  With regard to the competitive environment, the members do have any difficulties because they offer their products and services every day from strategic locations throughout the city.  Many of them have a loyal clientele that they have established as a result of many years of experience.   For example, the members who provide air conditioning services do not face financial difficulty because they have agreements with institutions to provide comprehensive maintenance.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to improve their home and businesses.  The members will purchase supplies and materials for making bread, snacks, empanadas, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Salte%C3%B1as\" target=\"_blank\" >salte\u00f1as<\/a>, as well as tools and equipment to improve the services they provide.  Others wish to invest in new businesses by acquiring a variety of merchandise to offer.  Their expectations for the future are to see their businesses well\u2013stocked so that they can provide better service to their customers and improve their product offerings so that they can keep up with new market demands, which will help them earn more income so that they can provide a better quality of life for their families.  Most of the members are experienced in working as part of a solidarity group.  They are aware that the entire Communal Bank is responsible for any shortfalls caused by any member who is late or fails to make a payment.  In addition, they know that it takes cooperation and unity to work together as a solidarity group.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

J. is president of the Tuungane loan group, and it is her raising her hand on the photo. She is a 48-year old widow and mother to five children, three of whom have their own homes and two who are students. Her husband passed away two years ago after a long illness. During all this time she has been the sole provider for her fatherless children. \r\n\r\nKavira sells smoked and fresh fish on a wholesale basis at the central market in Virunga. She began her small business with her own funds, a profit of $100 from a small commission. At that time she still lived in Vitshumbi, a fishing village situated alongside the west coast of Lake Verunga (known previously as Lake Edouard). She was delivery girl, intermediary and assistant to fish buyers coming from the town of Bukavi (south Kivu) and the fish farmers in Vitshumbi. She has been carrying out this fish selling business for the past 22 years. \r\n\r\nWith the loan from IMF Hekima, Kavira would like to increase her turnover by buying 200 or approximately two baskets of smoked fish and 400 or approximately three baskets of fresh fish. The main challenge of this activity is not to lose fish as a result of them rotting. For this reason she would like to buy a freezer. As far as her family is concerned, Kavira would like to send her fatherless children to school on a regular basis and see them get their diplomas so that they can do something useful for themselves and for society.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Kavira is planning to build a house with four bedrooms on her patch of land, which she will rent out in order to increase her income.\r\n\r\nKavira is grateful to IMF Hekima for her loans which she obtains without any material guarantee, since thanks to these loans she is able to provide for the needs of her children.\r\n\r\nThe Tuungane group is made up of 14 female members.\r\n         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":531846,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"200 smoked fish and 400 fresh fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Now she is borrowing her fifth loan for the amount of 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase a sewing machine for her tailoring business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He entered an apprenticeship and specialized in automobile air conditioning.  An energetic and very talented man, he has complete mastery of his specialization and provides quality service to his customers.  He has become very famous, and his shop is quick to take care of its numerous customers, who value his work highly.  He currently has seven apprentices.  Because of business needs and persistent customer demand, he has decided to sell refrigeration accessories essential to his work, rather than buying them elsewhere in Ghana.  But his new plan requires more funding than he has.  His keen sense of management and his discipline will allow him to realize his plan successfully.  The $1,200 loan that he is requesting will go towards a machine and towards refrigeration accessories to sell in his shop.

Although his farm is small, it has been providing for him and his family for over 30 years. He is now seeking to make an investment in order to reap more benefits from the land. He wants to invest in fertilizers and pesticides in order to better care for his main crop, rice. William and his family also raise pigs and chicken on their farm, only selling them when they are in need of money. William has his rice processed and commercialized at his associations facilities, where he also works part time.   <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> William is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":25079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T20:28:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T07:31:29Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61,"local_amount":61,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21393},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:16:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40778},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:10:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45297},{"amount":293,"local_amount":293,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:09:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":293,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99051},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:51:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106811}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T07:31:29Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:51:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11749,"name":"Fizuli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fizuli K.

from Tanzania! This is 34-year-old Atuganile M. from Dar es Salaam She is single and has two children, ages 13 and 18. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting three other dependants because their parents do not take care of them. Atuganile has been running a mobile phone accessories business since 2004. It is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania. This is probably attributable to the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people, because there are few landlines. Also, mobile phones are relatively cheap in Tanzania. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 per week and is assisted by two employees. Atuganile currently earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $750 USD to purchase additional mobile phone accessories. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Atuganile thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":212571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy mobile phone accessories in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T16:40:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atuganile","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T18:07:42Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348075},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970661},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886878},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436138},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130411},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027213},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613251},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010334},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:55Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232645},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664461}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T18:07:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":73213,"name":"Ruby Minerva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruby es socia de Banco Comunal El Pino.

Nos cuenta, que su esposo es persona muy conformista, no le gustan los trabajos pesados; pero a ella le gusta mucho trabajar y progresar para el bienestar de sus hijos. Por ello se levanta a las 4.00am para preparar los alimentos y una vez terminada esa labor va rumbo a su chacra para proseguir con el proceso de trasplantar sus matas de caf\u00e9 para que no dejen de producir. Todos los fines de semana prepara la carga de pl\u00e1tanos para enviar a los mercados de la ciudad de La Merced.

She tells us that her husband is a very conformist person who doesn't like hard work, but that she loves to work and to get ahead for the good of her children. Therefore, she gets up at 4.00 a.m. to prepare food.  Once this work is done, she goes directly to her small plot of land to continue with the process of transplanting her coffee bushes so they don't stop producing.  Every weekend she prepares a shipment of plantains to send to the markets in the city, La Merced.  In Carmen\u2019s opinion, all of her crops are profitable because the plantains generate income every weekend, while the coffee harvest is every season.  \r\n\r\nHer plans for the future are to increase her crops, to improve their production, and cover all of her children's educational costs.

Roquesa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. Roquesa is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Roquesa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The district is bordered on the northern and southern sides by silver and iron mines, and the southern area also has lime.  Agriculture is the primary industry, and many people also dedicate themselves to making straw hats.  This cooperative bank is comprised of members that are very collaborative, organized, and timely.  Carrying out farming endeavors is the fundamental basis for their companionship given that, whenever someone needs help, they group together to help out.  They also work as a group when there are celebrations and festivals.\r\n\r\nIlda Alejandra Pe\u00f1alosa U. is 45 years old, married, and has 5 children ages 28, 18, 15, 12 and 6.  She is also responsible for 3 young nieces and nephews, all under the age of 10.  She tells us that her younger sister, a single mother, left three years ago and never returned.  Ilda took charge of caring for her children, and says that God gives her the strength and patience she needs to forge ahead.  They are never lacking in food, given that the very land they live on provides sustenance.\r\n\r\nTwo of her three oldest children study at the school in San Bartola, and the other at the school in Ruizho.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s help, who has veterinary skills, they have been able to get ahead.  He works in the areas surrounding Ruizho, particularly the towns that need veterinary help.  Ilda lives in a house they own, but it is small and made of adobe and tile.  In addition to tending to the home and raising her animals, she works selling food at the CREA and the Paradise Park, commercial areas of Cuenca, on Saturdays and Sundays.  In the case of her work for CREA, she has to sleep in a small room she rents near the 27th of February Market because she starts work at 3 am and finishes at noon.  On Sundays, she works from 6 am to 2 pm.  She makes coffee, chocolates, empanadas, corn tortillas and other foods.  The loan of $550 USD requested by Ilda will be used to invest in the purchase of fertilizer for her land, poultry to raise, and plastic tables and chairs for her business.  Her goal is to continue to provide an education for her children and to build a stronger and bigger house for her family.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

They currently live in their own house.  When he was single he worked in a hotel as a waiter, getting paid a minimal wage; for this reason he decided to return to his birthplace and take up again in the growing of cocoa, citrus fruit and coffee crops, giving them the necessary care so that they grow and produce fruit. In order for his efforts to be profitable he needs to fertilize every six months to accelerate the growing process.  He sells his production in the markets of the city of La Merced, where he makes money to cover the necessary expenses of his home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since she was young, Tessie was fond of cultivating the land for farming the way Mother Nature takes care of its resources. Planting rice, vegetables, and root crops were her family\u2019s source of living then. When Tessie had her own family, this same activity became her source of income to support the needs of her four children who are now 19 to 25 years old. After many years of doing such business, her family's standard of living has changed very little because all the profit she and her husband make farming is barely sufficient to cover her family's basic needs.\r\n\r\nBy becoming a member of ASHI and through the loan she can access, Tessie thinks that the livelihood activity she and her husband are doing will become a business someday and through cultivating the land she will also be cultivating her own potential as well as her children\u2019s potentials despite of their low educational attainment. She will used the loan to purchase rice seed, peanuts, and string beans seedlings for her farming

This group is composed of 4 members who all know each other and are neighbors. Gabriela A. Garc\u00e9s is a member of the group. She is 39-years-old and lives in a common law marriage. Her husband works in the fields. She completed her studies up until the 3rd year of secondary school and she has her secondary school certificate. She has two sons named Cesar (15-years-old and in secondary school) and Miguel \u00c1ngel (8-years-old and in 2nd grade). She has requested a loan to buy fertilizer to grow corn as well as to plant corn. On the weekends, she sells corn, chicarrones [pork rinds], and chicken feet.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the Cuautla supply center and in the main squares of Tlayecac and Yautepec. She began this business 9 years ago. She did not know how to do anything but necessity made her work and since none of her neighbors were selling, she decided to sell corn and chicharrones. In the beginning she sold very little, but now people buy more from her. The majority of people in the town plant corn and although her sales decrease on the weekends during corn harvest season, she sells corn in the town centers. Her business is located in her home in San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan, Tlayacapan. She considers this business important because each week it helps her with family expenses such as food and milk as well as school expenses for her children. She is not lacking the most necessary items. The most gratifying thing for her is serving her customers because it distracts her. When she's not selling, she feels sad. Her customers are her neighbors and residents of other neighboring communities that come to buy her corn. She uses her business earnings to buy school materials and uniforms for her sons. With her earnings, she improves the quality of the food that she gives to her family.\r\n\r\nGabriela is planning to expand her business, since she would like to sell sweets and cakes, and wants to open a location in a room that she plans to set up, with a door that opens out to the street. She wants to put up a ceiling and set everything up so that it's an attractive place. She plans to achieve this with the loans since she pays them little by little. This business has helped her family in the past and it continues to help them. She does not plan to stop and wants to continue saving for when she is older. \"Children live their lives and do not take care of their parents once they're grown,\" Gabriela tells us.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with this loan because they approved her. She wants her sons to pursue their careers or technical vocations. San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan, Tlayacapan is a town with a cold climate. They are still planting and there is a festival in San Andr\u00e9s on November 30th. All the families make food and expect visits from people who come from other towns.

Her goal is to continue investing in the business so that she can establish a steady source of income.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":532050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-04-30T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alma Nubia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":129.47,"local_amount":2761.93,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144711088},{"amount":58.12,"local_amount":1239.85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761539},{"amount":69.3,"local_amount":1478.42,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848498},{"amount":55.61,"local_amount":1187.06,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1187.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256445},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1333.49,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1334.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802452},{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":1347.17,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1347.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956293},{"amount":311.85,"local_amount":6652.08,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6655.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685422}],"funded_date":"2010-05-24T18:15:56Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":201099,"name":"Lhagvajav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lhagvajav D., 42, lives with her husband in an apartment in Hovd province, Mongolia.

Presently, Maricel and her husband Jimmy have one child. Despite her early marriage and motherhood, Maricel is very protective of her son.

For this, it is necessary to purchase stone, sand, cement and iron. <p>\r\nIn the long run, her goal is to offer more products to her customers, achieve a better position to continue making home improvements, and help her children with school to enable them to continue preparing to be honest and good men.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":202699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Construction of a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-09-24T05:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-08T06:47:45Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5281417},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893244},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816321},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351028},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038346},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928649},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383586},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890078},{"amount":30.53,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":595.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111408}],"funded_date":"2008-09-24T06:47:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn Ting","image":653228}},{"id":69163,"name":"Nurkhanim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nurkhanim F. is 54 years old.

Mar\u00eda le pone mucho empe\u00f1o a su trabajo por brindarle lo justo y necesario a sus hijos, los mismos que desde ya se sienten agradecidos con ella. Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es el trato directo que tiene con sus clientes con quienes comparte muchas ideas, adem\u00e1s le es muy rentable porque no s\u00f3lo tiene su puesto en el mercado, sino que tambi\u00e9n su esposo se encarga de vender los mismos art\u00edculos pero por los caser\u00edos de su zona.

They have three children who help their parents as much as possible.     Maria has been selling plastic goods from a stand in the market for 3 years.    She works hard at her business to provide for her children, and they appreciate her efforts.   What she likes about her work is that she interfaces directly with her customers, sharing ideas and conversation.   Her business does well because she not only sells from her stand in the market, but her husband is in charge of selling their plastic goods around the city as well.   This is the first loan with MFP, and with the money requested they will invest in more plastic goods to sell as well as expand their small stand in the market.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":260523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more plastic goods to sell, and expand her small stand in the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.51},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":148.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.21,"local_amount":116.98,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":128.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423683},{"amount":43.58,"local_amount":126.77,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":138.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116952},{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":129.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":141.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011873},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":136.88,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":149.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595471},{"amount":48.64,"local_amount":141.51,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":154.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989713},{"amount":50.99,"local_amount":148.31,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":162.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210848}],"funded_date":"2009-01-24T23:31:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":89645,"name":"Oeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oeun S. is 43 years old and lives with her husband in Kampong Cham, Cambodia.

The hope of Siliva and her husband is to plant without using chemical products since in the long run it impoverishes the land. For this, the couple propose to maintain and care for their lands organically, and once they harvest their fruits to offer them at the big markets in Lima. Silvia is very excited and pleased. Furthermore, she is convinced that this these kinds of products, with time, will result in very high demand and be very profitable. Silvia has been working dynamically and responsibility with her community bank. This is her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she has always been very good with her payments. The money she is requesting will be use to purchase fertile land that she happens to find.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":304156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842094}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T08:40:39Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":106029,"name":"Neema's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neema Abudallah, age 26, is single with three children ages, 18, 16 and 12 years.

She then started cooking and selling food, buying and selling charcoal and selling ice.\r\n\r\nEventually, she thought of other businesses as her loanable amount in ASHI increased. Aside from her previous business she thought of raising livestock such as chickens, pigs, and cattle in their backyard. She lives in a mountainous area of the province of Antique, Philippines, and they have a wide, verdant space in their backyard that is good for raising animals. Some of these animals, after a certain period of time, will be sold and others will multiply. Her loan previously received is intended for this purpose. \r\n\r\nOut of the profit she will have in her businesses, she envisions that someday she will be able to build a stable house to shelter her family, and that she will become a successful entrepreneur someday, and she will be a mother that her children can be proud of.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":353346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She has had an educational center for the last 5 years which she installed in her own home.  As a teacher, she saw that it would be appropriate to invest her knowledge in her own business, one in which she can impart to children not only academics, but human values too.  Giovanna likes her work very much; this is why she is so dedicated to it, as is her mother. They are always watchful of the needs of the children with respect to infrastructure, equipment, etc.  For this reason, she believes that she must improve the infrastructure to accommodate more students and provide more comfort for the children.

She has worked in this for 4 years and it has been very profitable.  She usually sells this beverage at the different activities in the area where she lives.  They always request her service because she is a reliable person.  Every Saturday she also goes to the local soccer field.  There are always a lot of people due to the games that they play there and she makes good sales.  Gloria hopes to keep working to consolidate her business and make it more stable in the future.  She has been thinking about tackling another parallel job but she still hasn\u2019t decided in what.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With two years of experience, she is mastering her business and is much in demand.\r\n\r\nFatoumata, who is on her first loan, joined the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso through her mother-in-law. She intends to use her loan to buy a major quantity of merchandise for her shop. She gets her supplies in Bamako and in Bougouni. Accepting cash or credit, she makes her sales retail to a diverse and varied customer base.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans on making a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA. With the profits, she envisions expanding her shop.\r\n\r\n

Thanks to her persistent work, Nazgul's business currently yields about 8,000 som per month from sale of milk and meat products.  In order to further grow her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase bulls for fattening up.

husband's income was not sufficient to support their growing family. Slowly but surely the word got around and the customers started to come. Now her corner store is firmly established but it is not quite enough to make ends meet so in the afternoons she sells sweet drinks made of corn called <i>atol<\/i> and also lunch food called <i>tostados<\/i>. She works hard from early morning to late at night caring for her family, preparing the food for the day and running the two businesses. She is one busy person.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria also cares for her oldest daughter (age 15), who suffers from cerebral palsy resulting in mental and physical disability as well as speech problems. The daughter no longer receives treatment at the Fundabien Institution so the burden falls on Maria's shoulders Sometime she gets depressed and feels overwhelmed.
