Republic).\r\nShe is married with three grown children.  She lives with her husband and is the guardian of two school-aged granddaughters.  Tamara was the eldest daughter of a simple farm family.  She spent most of her time doing household chores: looking after her younger sister, doing homework, and doing housework.  When Tamara graduated from school she started studying sales at the Przhevalsky Vocational College (in the Issykulsky region of the Kirghiz Republic). There she met her husband, and she married when she was eighteen.   In 1968, she had a son. That year they decided to move to Zhajylma village (in the Chujsky region of the Kirghiz Republic) where they got jobs as a milkmaid and as a tractor operator. The collective farm allocated them some land in the village to build a house.  In 1970 and 1972 Tamara gave birth to two more daughters.\r\nTamara's family did not immediately have a farm.  On the land allocated to them by the state, they built a house and started the farm with cattle they had bred. In time, the two oldest daughters married and left home.  Tamara had to sell part of their cattle to help support them.  Presently, Tamara and her husband receive pensions and also work on the collective farm as watchmen.\r\nNow on her farm, Tamara has two bulls and ten sheep.  Tamara plans to increase her cattle, and therefore is asking for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS).\r\nTamara dreams of further expanding the farm to create living conditions worthy of her family.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

This way of working will allow her to generate resources to support her future family since she\u2019s currently single.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the credit training and the health services.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph two of Justa\u2019s daughters appear; they are the two young girls in front.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":813271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T19:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene Sofia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa Feliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizeth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8585.85,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":858.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":858.62,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":870.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746238},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115865},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877520},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694227},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650261},{"amount":124.95,"local_amount":858.27,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":869.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867258}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T05:05:01Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":320730,"name":"Mama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 50-year-old Mama.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes,  is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has three children. In light of the global crisis, her husband sought work, and eventually he was employed but far from his family. At first she experienced difficulty and had to make a big adjustment. In order to help her husband, she began to buy and sell fashion jewelry (silver). It was a good decision because she earns additional income. She got her capital from Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative. Most of her sales come from orders, so 98% is sold already. Aside from fashion jewelry, she is also a dealer of Natasha, MSE & Avon Products. Today, she is applying for a loan of PHP 10,000 to buy additional stock of fashion jewelry such as silver. Someday, she aims to have a store for fashion jewelry.

Aufaatasi has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Aufaatasi  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aufaatasi  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Aufaatasi  is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will also be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Aufaatasi from SPBD. Aufaatasi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":364710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Suy S. is a local chef. She is also hired by people who need her to cook food for their parties. She is 59 and a widowed mother who has given birth to two daughters. One of the daughters is married and one is single. Suy S. also depends on other income from her both daughters who are garment workers for industry at Phnom Penh.

He is married to Cecilia and has 4 kids aged 12, 9, 7, and 1. They are going through rough times right now because his youngest child has a disease in both eyes; (congenital cataracts). Sadly, they cant't have the surgery because the doctors told them it is very expensive; ($1,000). At the moment they don't have that kind of money; they only have enough for food and to send the kids to school.\r\n\r\nJavier and his family live in Cochabamba city in the Viloma Grande area. His main activity is construction and his wife works in the production of raw milk  for making cheese. They have a small house with only 2 rooms.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy a head of dairy cattle. This way, the amount of cheese for sale will increase and so will their income. Among his dreams and goals the most important thing is to save money for his youngest son's surgery who is suffering very much with the disease. Also, Mr. Javier wants to build a bigger house with a room for each of the kids, because the one they have is too small.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

For more than three years, she has engaged in selling religious articles such as music CDs, Bibles, prints, and posters.  Rosa comes from a very religious family.  Her sales are made by taking orders.  Since there is not a place in her area that offers this type of merchandise, Rosa must travel nearly two hours to the central part of the city where she can acquire all the items that she can sell to members of her congregation.  Rosa is pleased with her work and enjoys keeping busy, as well as sharing her faith.

She lives in her own house with her four children, for whom she wants to continue working very hard to give them a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn Faustina's life, the green fields of the town in her district have been a very pleasant place to work.  Her parents taught her this work since she was very little.  She currently has land, properties that she and her husband bought.  Nevertheless, she continues working these lands, 12 years growing cacao, coffee, and trees.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most is the harvest, since in this way she sees the reward after so much work.  On the other hand, it's difficult for her to transport the harvested products to the storage centers, located an hour away.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, if she manages to get the loan she will buy pack animals like a donkey, which is very useful for transportation.  In time, she wants to get enough money to buy new land.\r\n\r\nThis will be her seventeenth loan with MFP.  She hopes for the support of every one of you to continue working in agriculture.

A month later, Esperanza gave her a loan with which she expanded her business. This group is composed of 15 members running different businesses like shoes, clothing, cosmetics, and many other small businesses.\r\n\r\nDelia plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing jeans, blouses, t-shirts, shoes and cosmetics. She operates a miscellaneous sales business, selling products like these and many others, such as jewels, underwear, etc.  She has had her business for almost two years. She is excited to be taking out her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She will save her profits to reinvest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe makes her home here in a simple house with her long-time partner and their three children. She says that her most difficult challenge is to raise her children and to give them all they need.

and his wife Ludmila are a husband and wife business team. Together they successfully manage a little grocery kiosk at one of the local markets in Nikopol. Both Zachar and Ludmila have higher educations but instead of directly applying their schooling, they decided to become business owners. Their family also consists of a little boy whom they love and nurture. \r\n<p>\r\nIt has been Zachar and Ludmila\u2019s desire to operate their business profitably and see it fully sustain their family. Today, they are seeing stability in their work and good returns. They would like to expend their grocery line in order to meet customer demand and generate additional profits. While both of them devote most of their time to their grocery kiosk, Ludmila has begun an additional business selling water filters. The couple is hopeful to see this venture take off in the future.  \r\n<p>\r\nThrough several years of partnering with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d, Zachar and Ludmila have proven themselves to be responsible, goal-oriented and hard-working entrepreneurs.

He has been in the welding business since 2005 and his business has been the main source of his family income since then.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Meripa has many years of experience in this business.  Meripa needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Meripa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Meripa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Meripa F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.45 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.55 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

G. lives in the village of Nagrumbuan, Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 34 years old, and leads a 17-member loan group through ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFlorida is married and has two school-aged children. She makes a living by running a general store where she sells shampoo, soap and toothpaste to people in her local community. Florida has been engaged in business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nLast year, she joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and business. Florida has applied for her third, for 7,000 PHP, to expand her small store. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines and has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

With those loans, she has been able to have a source of financial capital to support the growth of her husband\u2019s fishing business as well as providing herself with the livelihood activity of fish selling. The proceeds they get out of their business go to the needs of her children and the entire family. Since then, their life has eventually changed a little. With the loan she is requesting now, Janeth is optimistic that someday she will finally bring her family out of poverty by making her business stable and profitable.

However, the summer months were slow, and he now needs a loan for working capital to help him get through this rough time. \r\n\r\nThis is Simon\u2019s second loan. In 2008, when Hurricane Dolly swept through Texas, the roof of his auto body shop went with it. Simon used his first loan to buy a new, solid roof that could endure the hurricane force winds and rain that annually threaten south Texas. The new roof allowed him to continue working and he successfully paid back the loan.\r\n\r\nWhen business slows down, Simon does not stop working. He does other landscaping jobs in order to make the loan payments. \r\n\r\nAs an avid rock collector, Simon hopes that one day he will be able to pursue his passion for rocks more

She is single and has two children, both of whom are in school. She also takes care of an additional family member (her sister's daughter). Rebecca is in the business of selling charcoal. She has been in this business for over four years and works seven days a week. Rebecca sells her products at the market for retail. Rebecca has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bags of charcoal. The main business challenge(s) for Rebecca include seasonality.

She has been in this business for around 2 years and started after taking her first loan with Esperanza Internacional.  She tells us that she started out in her business because some of her neighbors were familiar with the micro-credit program and invited her to take part.  Josefina has already had 4 loans from Esperanza Internacional and she feels very grateful because the loans have enabled her to make progress and invest in her business.  She will invest this new loan in buying packets of cassava bread wholesale which she will then sell as a retailer.\r\n\r\nJosefina's story is representative of the other members of her group and Esperanza's clients in general, both the Haitians (who have mostly emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) and the Dominicans who generally live in very poor communities.  This area, like many poor areas in the Dominican Republic, lacks reliable drinking water and electricity.

The business was run successfully for more than three decades thanks to growing interest of local and foreign customers. \r\n\r\nGrowing older Kalbubu keeps feeling less good and was forced to quit working so hard and to devote some time to herself. A few years ago she was lucky to have good medical treatment in the neighboring country of Turkmenistan. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not a cheap procedure, so in order to get another medical treatment she is requesting a loan from Kiva. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

With his first loan he would like to buy 3 cases of a variety of cigarettes, 2 cartons of tea, 1sack of sugar, 5 packages of candies, 10 packages of chewing gum, 30 packages of matches, 5 cartons of soap, etc. He buys from wholesalers in the neighborhood before selling at retail.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to earn a profit of 70,000 FCFA which he will  use mainly to increase his business operating funds, contribute to family expenses and make loan payments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":263079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy a variety of articles for resale ( cigarettes, candies, matches, chewing gum, powered milk, tea, sugar, soap, etc )","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lassina ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":31250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":65153.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440375},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":32576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135754},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":32576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033555},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620923},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019888},{"amount":65.58,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242638},{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":32576.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678157}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T18:13:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":90473,"name":"Badenya Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les six femmes du groupe Badenya sont toutes mari\u00e9es avec une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 39 ans et  5 enfants.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products like soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Maria Eloisa has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $70 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria Eloisa joined the Kiva field partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Maria Eloisa has successfully repaid a previous loan  from GDMPC. She is requesting a new loan to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Maria Eloisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business and to support her family's basic needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

plying the route of Baseco-Delpan-Divisoria in Port Area, Manila.  She lives with her husband Mama, 65 and their 3 adult children.  They belong to the Islam faith.\r\n\r\nShe started with her business in 2005 with just one motorized tricycle.  The demand for transportation in their community picked up with the establishment of Habitat for Humanity Community Housing. In the same year she purchased her first motorized tricycle and then had to purchase a second one.  She joined the CCT Credit Cooperative in 2004, at that time she was only managing two pedicabs (a manually operated tricycle with no engine).  She disposed off these manual tricycles in 2005.\r\n\r\nJust recently, she bought her third motorcycle.  Her son is now test-driving this with a sidecar is mounted to it.  She has just finished paying off her CCT loan of Php 10,000.00 which she used to pay for the down payment for her third motorcycle.  She took a new loan in the amount of Php 12,000.00 to purchase and refurbish a second-hand side-car to be mounted on her newly purchased motorcycle.\r\n\r\nNoraida is very proud of having been part of the CCT Credit Cooperative.  She is even delighted to see her neighbors taking rounds in driving her motorized tricycles for a living.  She dreams of owning a taxicab someday. \r\n\r\nCCT is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered on the Lordship of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":354674,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Son p\u00e8re est un \u00e9leveur tr\u00e8s connu, et il a enseign\u00e9 a son fils le m\u00e9tier.  Avec les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de son \u201cop\u00e9ration Tabaski\u201d, M. D. voudrait aider son p\u00e8re pour s'approvisionner plus des moutons et satisfaire son client\u00e8le \u00e0 meme-temps. ","en":"Mr. Mamadou D. is requesting a 200,000 XOF loan to take advantage of the drop in the price of sheep following the Tabaski celebrations. Tabaski (the Eid in Arab countries) is the festival of sacrifice to mark the end of the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. Every person over the age of majority who has the means must sacrifice a sheep to observe the festival, and the markets in Senegal are inundated with sheep. Once the festival is over, the sheep vendors are looking for a quick sale.<br> \r\nMr. D. is the secretary of the Greffe, the court of first instance in Bambey, some 100km from Dakar. UIMCEC opened up a branch there in July 2009 to better serve rural clients. Buying and selling sheep may only provide a supplemental income to Mr. D., but it is still very important to him. His father is a well-known sheep farmer, who taught him the profession. With the profits from \u201cOperation Tabaski\u201d, M. D. would like to supply his father with more sheep while also satisfying his own customers\u2019 demands. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":454914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Bambey","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-12-22T21:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:05:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110781407},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168482},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007435},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036501},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759059},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-18T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790573},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971012},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":25815.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708279}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T03:28:56Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":168593,"name":"Apitaila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Apitaila  S. is 31 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 10).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Apitaila  has many years of experience in this business.  Apitaila  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 155 tala or US $65 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Apitaila  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Apitaila 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Apitaila  S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":152094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of beans and fish in bulk, as well as open a small bar out the front of her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-23T13:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-11T17:20:55Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33,"local_amount":40615.38,"processed_date":"2008-06-11T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":40656,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":235568},{"amount":33,"local_amount":40615.38,"processed_date":"2008-07-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40656,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264335},{"amount":33,"local_amount":40615.38,"processed_date":"2008-08-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":40656,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":293257},{"amount":33,"local_amount":40615.38,"processed_date":"2008-09-11T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40656,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323758},{"amount":33,"local_amount":40615.38,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-19T07:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40656,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356171},{"amount":30,"local_amount":36923.1,"processed_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":36960.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347615},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40040,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970235},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40040,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886485},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":40040,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435770},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":40039.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130075}],"funded_date":"2008-04-27T17:20:55Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49510,"name":"Theong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theong L. is a rice farmer in Kampong Cham.

Her business brings her income, but is also needed for the local population as this oil is one of the basic ingredients for the local diet. Her turnover totals are not sufficient in order for her to satisfy demand for her products, so she has decided to take out a loan to increase her turnover.

Reyna group consists of two members: Reyna Isabel S. and Luis Alberto M..  Luis is 78, and his friend Reyna is 44.  Reyna is single and has 3 children: her oldest, 22, works for himself; her daughter, 20, is in her 5th year of high school;   and her son, 18, is in the 5th grade of elementary school and works nights.  Luis is married and has 5 children: his oldest, 40, is in his 2nd year of high school, and works for himself; his son, 38, is in his 3rd year of high school; another son, 32, is in his 5th year of high school; his daughter, 26, is in her 3rd year of high school; and his youngest son, 26, is in his 4th year of high school.  All of Luis's children both work and study; they didn't have the opportunity to go to school before and now they want to.  His wife is a homemaker.  \r\n\r\nLuis's plans include improving his house for his family.  He would like to buy a pickup truck so he can better serve his customers and sell more firewood.  He would also like to upgrade his construction equipment.  Rosa's goal is to keep her business active so she can continue to generate more income for her family.  She would like to expand her business by hiring three women to help her out.  She also wants to offer more products to her customers.  Rosa wants to run a business that is more useful to her community so she can meet her customers' needs.  \r\n\r\nLuis and Reyna are in different lines of work.  Luis makes his living selling firewood, while Reyna makes and sells tortillas.  She works from her home and has been in business for 14 years.  Luis travels around, and has been in business for 15 years.  He had started out in a different business: he had 8 pigs, which he later sold, and used the money to buy a horse and wagon.  Later, one of his sons gave him the money to start his firewood business, and he paid his son back with his earnings.  He liked this business since it gave him income for his family and his customers bought plenty from him.  Reyna, on the other hand, started with her own money, which she earned working as a domestic.  She liked her tortilla business and she decided to stay with it.  She invested her earnings into her business, enabling her to start doing business from her home. \r\n\r\nReyna is seeking a loan to use as working capital, as she has to buy firewood, corn, and lime, and the price of corn is very high.  Luis is seeking a loan for working capital.  He plans to use the money to buy a power saw, to make his work easier.  He also needs to make improvements to his wagon and buy medicine for his horse.  The horse and wagon are necessary for his business, and he has to give his horse medicine.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":263094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-29T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":896.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400025},{"amount":75.29,"local_amount":1338.48,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092023},{"amount":14.71,"local_amount":261.52,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":292.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985406},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":896.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446021},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":896.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956660}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T04:37:47Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":90489,"name":"Istemeli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Istemeli A. is a 35-year-old farmer who breeds calves in the small village of Imishli City.

Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is 52 and has two adult children, ages 26 and 28. Her older son graduated from college with a degree in Mass Communication and already has his own family. Her younger son is a trained radio technician. He has not yet found work in his field of study, so he currently earns his living by driving one of two tricycles (a motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers) owned by Suzette.\r\n<p>\r\nDespite being separated from her husband, Suzette strives hard to meet her familial obligations, trying to be both mother and father to her sons. Without the additional support of another breadwinner in the family, Suzette has been doing her utmost to continue pursuing her dreams for her children, because she truly believes that her dream will come true. She holds on and trusts that she can succeed through hard work, perseverance, and full faith in the Almighty.\r\n<p>\r\nHer progress out of poverty started in 2003 when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and borrowed PHP 3,000 to start a food vending business. She started out as a sort of one-man band: she both cooked the food and sold it to people in her neighborhood. She began buying bananas in bulk and selling them to her neighbors in retail. Her business activities also helped her adjust to her new single status, and she became more independent and empowered because she knew she had the capacity to provide for her young family.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her business continued to improve, she was able to buy a motorized water pump for her house, which in turn allowed her to raise pigs in her backyard without offending her neighbors with the usual foul odor that occurs when a pig-raising business is not maintained well. From her subsequent loans, she was able to buy tricycles for her sons to drive, allowing them to help earn a living for their families. She was also able to buy the rights to a piece of land. Her combined net income from all her business activities eventually amounted to PHP 3,500 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of her good credit performance in her group, her center, and NWTF-PD (Negro Women for Tomorrow Foundation - Project Dungannon), she was able to secure the amount of Php 19,500 for her thirteenth cycle loan, which she used for her business. The loan was paid in timely weekly installments and was fully paid within its set term. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her fourteenth cycle, she is borrowing Php 25,000 to be used for her business, as well as to pay for motorcycle maintenance, because when the machines are in good condition they are able to generate more income. The profits earned from this loan will be used for the needs of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nSuzette is shown in the picture posing with the two tricycles that are in need of maintenance work.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, the Negro Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Tauinaola has many years of experience in this business.  Tauinaola needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 220 tala or US $92 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tauinaola joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tauinaola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tauinaola G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He has gained a lot of experience in this business as he has always helped out a lot with the cultivation of crops in his home community of Isfara, Tajikistan. Now he is the father of three adult children. Nowadays Janobiddin has managed to improve his family\u2019s economic situation thanks to the help brought to him by IMON International through a loan that he has used directly for his agricultural business. On this occasion Janobiddin is seeking IMON International\u2019s help so that he can benefit from improved technical assistance in his farming - so that, when harvest time comes around, he can improve his economic situation. Please support this father so his effort is worthwhile. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mary herself never went to school due to poverty. Besides her own children, Mary also cares for a niece and nephew.\r\n\r\nMary's business is the sale of general goods, such as soap and candles, and food items, such as seasonings and pepper, onions, and rice.  She has been in business for more than 30 years, and today she sells from a market stall at the Chicken Soup Factory Market in Gardnersville, near Liberia's capital of Monrovia. During the Liberian civil war, Mary and her family fled the country for neighboring Guinea. When she returned to Liberia, she started her general goods business with about 30,000 Liberian dollars in seed money. With her 20,000 Liberian dollar share of this 75,000 Liberian dollar group loan, Mary plans to buy more inventory for her shop.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mary hopes to grow her business and open a store that sells general goods.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She lives in her own house with her 3 children; Edwin 26 years old, Jes\u00fas 23 years old and Cinthia, 7 years of age, who are the reason for all of her efforts. Her business is the sale of shopping bags, which she sells in the street as a traveling salesperson in search of customers who wish to take one of her attractive bags.  Her colorful products are in high demand in the market as people always have things that they need to take home.  What she likes most about her work is to speak with her customers and find out about the things happening in her area.   She has been doing this activity for 20 years and the most difficult thing for her it to have to walk all day under the intense sun, which tires and exhausts her, although she knows she is working hard to be able to achieve her goals.  In the future she hopes to have a small stand where she can sell her shopping bags without having to walk so much.  This is Nelida\u2019s first loan with MFP and she knows that she has to make all of her payments on time if she does not want to cause problems for the members of her communal bank where she is very admired for the responsibility that she demonstrates. With the 1000 soles requested she plans to buy more shopping bags to increase the quantity that she sells.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":315652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To Increase Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-07T21:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596212},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990490},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211601},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641122},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080562},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996687}],"funded_date":"2009-05-08T00:46:49Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":110985,"name":"Asia Aslam Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sadia Batool baji wants a loan to buy mobile phones for her mobile phone shop.<P>\r\n\r\nRani baji and Rukhsana baji each want a loan to buy raw materials (lentils, cooking oil and spices) for their food businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nAsia baji is married to Mr. A. who runs a stationery-selling business.

Jamolidin is 36 years old, married, and has two children. He grows vegetables and sells them in the market for income. He has been working in this kind of business sphere for almost 13 years and gained much experiences. Jamolidin has a large family considering that he is leaving with his parents. With his large family, Jamolidin works almost everyday to generate revenues for to support his family's living. Because of his family relying on vegetable growing, Jamolidin needs a loan to purchase necessary supplies for his current harvest and with that way to earn enough money for supporting his family. This will be his first loan with IMON International and Kiva and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bird","image":220084}},{"id":172758,"name":"Avazmat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A. Avazmat was born in 1964 and is married with two children. As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International, he was able to make a lot of progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming. Then, he saw a new business opportunity: rearing young cattle, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, Avazmat will purchase young cattle and feed for them to expand his business. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 31 years old. Arlene is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, junk foods, and detergents in the local community. She is also engaging in buying and selling ready to wear clothing. Arlene has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arlene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Arlene from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

con el liderazgo de su madre, muchos de ellos son parte de la basta clientela,  que tiene Xiomara en su negocio de confeccionar prendas de vestir como camisas, pantalones y ropa femenina en

She lives with her family in the Las Am\u00e9ricas neighborhood, a community that is undergoing community organization; under her mother\u2019s leadership the neighbors that live there have united and managed to equip parks.  Many of them are part of the vast clientele that Xiomara has in her dressmaking business.  She makes shirts, pants and women\u2019s clothes in general.\r\n\r\nEver since she was a little girl, Xiomara would play with her friends and she was the dolls\u2019 dressmaker.  Since then she showed her inclination towards this art.  Today, she has 20 years experience in the occupation and 17 running her business located in a site she owns.  \r\n\r\nXiomara is very proud of her development adding that it\u2019s the activity which she most enjoys and with which she\u2019s managed her home especially with respect to her children\u2019s schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn her operation she has a simple sewing machine, an overlock machine and an interlock machine as well as additional tools to produce quality items although her dream is to have in her business\u2019 infrastructure the most technologically advanced machines to offer employment to people who need it.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy three bolts of fabric and supplies to make women\u2019s dresses she has on order and has to have ready on time for her customers.  This investment will be successful because she will deliver completed orders to new and recommended customers which will lead to an increase in her accounts receivable portfolio which, in turn, impacts her profits.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to modify her home so she strives daily with this in mind and works persistently in order to reach it.  While this happens, though, Xiomara continues generating a profit margin of no less than 40% that she plans to sustain so that her business continues growing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":773759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to
