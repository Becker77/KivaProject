from Tanzania! Gloria M. lives in Dar es Salaam where she owns a Mama Lishe (local cafe) that she established in 2004. She is assisted by three employees in the running of her caf\u00e9 and earns monthly profit of about 300 USD. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \"restaurant\" or \"caf\u00e9,\" you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Gloria is requesting a loan of 800 USD in order to purchase a microwave and to make renovations to her caf\u00e9. Gloria hopes that her larger caf\u00e9 will be able to hold more customers and thus enable her to expand her business and earn increased profits in the near future.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":192716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies for her cafe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T17:12:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:13:37Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356224},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347977},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970551},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886768},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436028},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130301},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027132},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613172},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010255},{"amount":80,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":92640,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232566}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:13:37Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65541,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine M. is 52 years old and is divorced with two grown children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This means she works only when she has clients. Samar requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase new tools, as well as to pay for her children\u2019s school tuition. This is her second cycle and she has always paid on time.\r\n<p>\r\nSamar's work is special because she knows how to treat her clients well and is aware of new hairstyles.

Then, after caring for them for several months, he takes them to be sold. But this phase is complicated due to transportation issues. Because he does not own his own vehicle, he must work within the schedules and prices that are offered to him. He also sporadically ventures into agriculture, but he does not do this full-time because he believes that times have changed considerably and it is no longer a satisfactory occupation. <p>\r\nKhairullo\u2019s two children are his reason for continuing his efforts as a livestock breeder and farmer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is a member of the \u201cEstrellas de Tilapa\u201d (Stars of Tilapa) group which is located in the town of San Jos\u00e9 Tilapa, Puebla, Mexico.  In this photo you can see the 'pan de muerto' (bread of the dead) which is traditional for this season and which Belen makes with a lot of effort and dedication.  She started her bakery business 20 years ago.  She is requesting this loan to buy ingredients.  Her customers prefer to buy their bread from her because it is hand made unlike that sold in other bakeries.  Do\u00f1a Belen's bread is considered some of the best in the region.  She is currently feeling happy with this new loan.  She is 43 years old, studied at secondary level, is married and has two children who are already married and no longer live with her.  She hopes to sell her bread in more places and hopes to open another store in the not-so-distant future.

He is a skilled technician and always knows how to use the right technology for the right kind of product. \r\n\r\nThe family raises agricultural products starting from grains and berries, but also rare kinds of vegetables.

They live in large extended traditional families in the Banconi neighborhood in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). They met each others through neighboring ties and collaborations in the market where they all work. They typically buy and sell firewood, powdered drinks, condiments and fabrics. The group is seeking its sixth solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans were repaid without problems. With this new loan, the women intend to buy 10 packs of powered drinks, 6 cartloads of firewood, 30 meters of fabric and a large quantity of condiments (eggplants, onions, okra, etc). They purchase goods from wholesalers in the market of Sikasso. Firewood gets purchased from farmers having an authorization to sell wood. The products are then resold at home and in the market of the M\u00e9dine quarter where each woman has an emplacement with a table to display their wares. Having a mostly female clientele, the members of the Yeredon group retail their goods for cash and on credit.

obstacles and continue to improve her situation. She is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 43 years old, married, and the loving mother of four children.\r\n\r\nBarno started her own business because her husband\u2019s salary was not enough for their family expenses. For more than fourteen years she has operated a store where she sells women\u2019s shoes. Her store is well known and people love to visit it because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nBarno hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more shoes to sell. With this purpose in mind, Barno requests 8,000 Somoni. She promises to repay the loan on time and thanks everyone supporting her.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maribeth has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 Maribeth joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maribeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional rice and for use as working capital. Maribeth is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional rice to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Maribeth from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Julio is 18 years old.  She needs the loan to buy food.  She sells Mexican snacks in the evenings.  Her customers need a larger place.  She plans to use her earnings to make her place bigger.\r\n\r\nAmelia wanted this loan in order to increase the income from her business.  That way she will make her place of business bigger.

In the dry season, the weather in his village is quite hot and the plants turn yellow. The road to enter the village is unsealed and bumpy, and it is about a 1 hour drive from the TLM Baun Branch Office to this village.\r\n\r\nMatias leads a group called Mekobaun A1 Group; the group has 7 members. Matias is 34, married and has been blessed with 3 little children: Musa H. - 5 years old, Ibrahim H. - 3 years old and Alfred H. - 2 years old. \r\n\r\nTo fulfill his family\u2019s daily needs, Matias works hard  cultivating his farm. There are coconuts, bananas and beans and corn planted on the farm. He usually starts his day at 7.00 am and works until 12.00 pm; he returns home to have lunch and rest for 1 hour and then goes back to work until 05.00 pm. He usually takes public transport to sell his agricultural products at Oeba Market. It costs IDR 15,000 per return trip. By selling his agricultural products Matias is only able to generate small income of about IDR 50,000 to IDR 150,000 per week; it depends on which crops he can harvest from the farm. Even though Matias only generates a small income from his farm  he always tries his best to supply his family needs every day. \r\n\r\nMatias has a plan to renovate his house, to better meet his family needs and provide a better future for his children. For this reason, Matias is interested in joining the TLM Cattle Fattening Program. He is requesting a loan amounting IDR 3,400,000 to buy cattle to be fattened over a twelve month period. He hopes that he will be able to generate profit that can be used to buy building materials to renovate his house. The other group members of Mekobaun A1 are also requesting loans to buy cattle to be fattened. All of them hope to have a better life.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 29 years old, married, and father of two children,  2 years old and 4 months old. He completed the 12th grade, and continues with distance learning. He lives with his family in a rented house, and takes care of his mother who also lives in Boane, sending her money for her household expenses. In 2001 he finished teacher's training in the district of Manhi\u00e7a and was assigned by the Ministry of Education as a teacher in Boane, working from 7 to noon each day. He earns a salary of 5700 MZN a month, and manages to save some in his bank account. \r\n<p>\r\nMorgado used to take out loans from a credit institution (TCHUMA), but after learning about Hluvuku he chose to start getting loans through them.  This is his fourth loan, in the amount of 11,000 MZN. He plans to buy construction materials (rebar, cement, sand and other) to finish building his house. The previous loans were in the amounts of 8900 MZN, 13,000 MZN, and 15,000 MZN, all for the same work. He would like to request additional loans in the future to finish his house, purchase furniture, and finish his higher education. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David

fried fish to sell at Elmina. She is married and has been blessed with two children. She has been through junior high education. Phelomina has been selling banku with fried fish for some time now. Her husband is into wood work production. Phelomina uses her income generated from her banku business to help her husband take care of the home. Phelomina will add the loan to her income to purchase bags of maize for banku to be able to meet the demands of her customers. With the new profits that may accrue from her expanded business, Phelomina plans to reinvest back into her business. \r\n\r\nTo prepare her banku, she makes sure she gets her corn dough.

This way she will have another source of income.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to finish her house, which is still under construction.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":532133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy guinea pigs, chicken, and feed to start a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Zoila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":330,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":58.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709089},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":58.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892389},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632750},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":58.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846787},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":58.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113309},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":29.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406874}],"funded_date":"2010-05-04T14:01:16Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":201631,"name":"Elvia Soledad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elvia de 62 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona urbana en el Guasmo de Guayaquil, es viuda pero tiene tres hijos de 42, 33 y 31 a\u00f1os, hace 22 a\u00f1os atras falleci\u00f3 su esposo y tuvo que ingeniarse un plan para que sus hijos terminaran de estudiar, aunque sus ahorros no eran muchos Elvia los invirti\u00f3 en v\u00edveres y los empezo a vender en las afuera de su casa. \n\nPoco a poco con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n Elvia tuvo ingresos para una peque\u00f1a tienda y asi darle una mejor vida a sus hijos, en la actualidad trabaja desde las 06h30am hasta las 23:00pm todos los dias.

She is a widow but she has three children, ages 42, 33 and 31. Her husband died 22 years ago and she had to come up with a plan so her children could finish school. Although she didn't have much savings, Elvia invested in supplies and started to sell items outside of her home. Little by little with hard work and dedication, Elvia used the income to open a small store and thus provide a better life for her children. Currently she works from 6:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. every day selling candies, soft drinks, rice, etc. With the loan, she plans to purchase rice, soft drinks and stationery supplies for her store.

Poline is 18 years old and lives in the town of Kinoni in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is single, has no children, and is currently out of school.  Poline has a business in Kinoni selling coffee beans to local buyers in her village.  She has had this business for over two years now.\n\nTo expand her business, Poline is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used for buying greater supplies of coffee beans which she will then resell at her business.  Poline hopes to expand her young coffee business and generate more profit in order to contribute financially to her family. \n\n\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  \n\nThese loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

market called Panjshanbe. He is married with two children. After school, he was not able find a good-paying job, so he decided to go into business for himself. He has now been self-employed in his current business for eight years and is the sole breadwinner for his family. \r\n\r\nAbdukholik is very determined and serious about his business. These characteristics have helped him promptly repay six loans from IMON International. Maintaining a reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in Abdukholik\u2019s work and have ensured the success of his business. \r\n\r\nAbdukholik is asking for a loan of $3,000 to increase his assortment of goods. The loan will not only be beneficial for Abdukholik\u2019s business as it will promote its expansion, but it will also help him meet his household expenses and set aside some savings for future needs.\r\n \r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling animal feed & farm-related products in the local community. Maricel has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maricel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Maricel is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional stock of chicken and hog feeds. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Maricel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

","en":"This group is called \"Los Almendritos 1\" (\"The little almonds 1\"). The members of the group decided to name it that way because there are many almond trees around the house where they gather.\r\nThis story is about Braulia GabrieL., who is a member of the group. She is 27 years old and married to Agust\u00edn, who is a rural worker. They have children named Ricardo, Jennifer and Daysi. Only two of the children go to school - the oldest one just got into the third year of elementary school, the younger one is in the second year of preschool, and the baby is only 10 months old.\r\nShe has been making and selling typical Mexican snacks for three years. Braulia decided to get into this business because she says there is much demand for it and she makes very good profits. Also, she wanted to find a way to get her children ahead in order to improve their quality of life.\r\nShe used the loan to purchase more supplies such as red tomatoes, different kinds of pepper, potatoes, onions, chicken, meat, corn, olive oil, salt, etc., so that she can continue making her tasty snacks.\r\nGaby (as she is better known to her customers) hopes that someday she will be able to achieve her dream. She dreams of building a place where she can establish her restaurant and increase her production, which is her biggest wish. She also wishes to improve and increase her profits so that she can continue to proviD. education for her children and ensure their future.\r\nShe reports that the members of the group are very responsible, hardworking and punctual people. They have known each other for a long time and get along very well, because they live in the same neighborhood.\r\nShe is very thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the support and the loan she has been granted, since because of it, her business has been going much better.\r\nOther fellow members of Gaby's group are Mar\u00eda, Anal Aura, Minerva, Ignacia, Ad\u00e1n, Caritina and Mar\u00eda Julia.

Ngh\u0129a is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Y\u00ean H\u1eadu nh\u00f3m 03.\r\n\r\nNgh\u0129a is married and has one school-aged child. To making a living, Ngh\u0129a owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector making and selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling pork products in the local community. Ngh\u0129a has had this business for over two years and earns approximately 3,500,000 Viet Nam Dong (VND) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ngh\u0129a joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ngh\u0129a has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the second loan taken out by this borrower from SEDA. Ngh\u0129a plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Galia currently works selling dairy products such as Oxapampa cheeses, natural yoghurt, curds, etc.  In order to acquire these products, she travels every two weeks to the city of Oxapampa.  \"The cheese business is profitable.  For example, I buy every kilo for 8 soles and sell it for 15 soles\", she says.\r\n\r\nGalia's customers already know her.  They are mainly friends, and mothers of pupils who attend her children's school, who recommend her to other buyers.  For this reason, she always has orders year round.  Galia also started selling panettones, decorations and some imported clothes.  In order to acquire this merchandise, she travels to the city of Lima.  In the future, Galia hopes to set up a store so that she doesn't have to go door to door.  With your help, she will be able to access her first loan from MFP.  She pledges to make her repayments on the assigned dates.  In addition, she says that she feels very happy to belong to her community bank \"Mujeres al \u00e9xito\u201d.\r\n\r\nWith her loan money, Galia will buy products for the Christmas season such as panettones, pots, cooking implements, imported clothes, etc."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":933784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy panettones, pots, cooking utensils and imported clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T12:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Galia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":95.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":121.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":124.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":140.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":148.89},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":157.95},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":163.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.55,"local_amount":87.51,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":90.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836239},{"amount":36.53,"local_amount":95.31,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":98.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245999},{"amount":38.61,"local_amount":100.72,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386025},{"amount":42.55,"local_amount":111.01,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":115.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099115},{"amount":43.23,"local_amount":112.77,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":117.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713274},{"amount":380.53,"local_amount":992.68,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202149}],"funded_date":"2011-12-28T14:23:31Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":369671,"name":"Ida Parfaite","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cliente de 42 ans, celibataire avec 2 enfants a sa charge, elle se lance dans la vente des chaussures en 2000 pour subvenir aux besoins de ses enfants.\nAyant fait preuve d'une bonne capacit\u00e9 d'\u00e9pargne et des successives remboursements sans d\u00e9fauts de paiements,les pr\u00eats ont transforme puissamment  sa vie, elle a \u00e9largie son activit\u00e9, elle a  achet\u00e9 sa marchandises en gros et avec ses b\u00e9n\u00e9fices elle continue a renforcer son activite.\nTres pragmatique, elle tient a aller vers l'avant, son ambition est d'aller elle meme a l'\u00e9tranger pour  s'approvisionner, Elle prend soin de ses enfants et s'occupe valablement de leur scolarit\u00e9. \n","en":"This forty-two year old client, single with two children in her care, launched into shoe sales in 2000 to provide for the needs of her children.

Ziedullaevich B. lives in the Varzob region of Tajikistan. He is 29 years old, married and has 4 children. Shukrullo has a college degree in education. Currently he works as a contractor for hire, but his salary is not enough to support his family. That is why Shukrullo supplements the family income by raising cattle for sale. He has a small barn where he keeps his animals. Shukrullo purchases young calves, feeds them then sells the animals at the market at a higher price. His cattle business earnings supplement the family income. However, he would like to purchase more calves to expand his business and for that he requires this loan. Currently it is a good deal to buy meat cattle, since the animals are thin after the winter and are sold at a lower price. Shukrullo has been raising and selling cattle for the last 10 years. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432

","en":"The Kantutus group is represented by Bernardino and is maD. up of 16 members who operate various businesses including: clothing sales; fabric sales; footwear sales; cosmetics sales, sales of baked goods; taxi services; and construction services.  As in all commercial endeavors, there's competition and offers to sell similar products at lower costs, so the members have to have products for which there's a lot of demand and sell them for less.  One advantage for the group is that their businesses are located outsiD. of the city which gives them greater opportunities to sell.  The disadvantage of that for them is that their children can only get a rural education.  They hope to send their children to the city where they would receive a better education.  The loan will be used to buy merchandise and supplies to meet the demands of the market.  The members will be completing their third cycle so they know how to work within a cooperative and have demonstrated the responsibility and honesty required to get financing like that provided by

She works making clothes in her small tailoring shop and has done so for the past 13 years.  She has always liked designing and making clothes and that\u2019s why she has this job.  She really likes it because she decides her schedule and she challenges herself to finish the clothing [her customers] order.  Making clothes is a job that requires a lot of effort in order to have a good finished product.  The difficult part of her job are the many times Julia has cut or jabbed herself with needles and pins.  But she has learned how to deal with this and knows it is just one of the risks of being a seamstress.  This is Julia\u2019s eighth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and in her 4 years with MFP she has always been very responsible and on-time with her payments.  With this loan money she will buy more material and fabric to make more clothing and increase her earnings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":262285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabric for making clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-27T22:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":336.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423718},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":336.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116987},{"amount":108.22,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":336.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011908},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":336.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595508},{"amount":108.23,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989747},{"amount":108.86,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":338.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210886}],"funded_date":"2009-01-28T01:01:35Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":90177,"name":"Obloior","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Obloior is married and the father of two children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The shop, which is now more than 20 years old, began as a clothing shop.  Along with dressmaking to measurements, she also buys already-made clothing to sell in her house.  Nowadays, selling the purchased clothing generates the greatest income, since the competition from Western products, which are much cheaper, means that the people prefer to buy already made clothing.\r\n\r\nShe began working in a jeans factory for a well-known label.  She left this job when she got the plot of land in the place where she actually lives.  In order to not lose the land, she had to move to live there.  Because of this, her job was far away and she decided to open her own shop.  Little by little she has accomplished her goals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. Today Mahmud would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can then maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting this first loan to purchase young cattle. This will be his first loan with IMON International, a Kiva field partner, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 27 years old. Rodura is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Rodura raises pigs for sale. Rodura has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $200 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rodura joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Rodura is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with her small, one year old son, Kevin, and an aunt who takes care of the little one during the day because Silvia has to leave to work.\r\n\r\nSilvia heads towards her stand in the market very early in the morning.

He has carried out this activity alone or with the help of workmen whom he hires for planting and harvesting. What he likes most is harvest time. When he sees his products of good quality and good size, he knows that it is due to the effort and dedication that he put into his land. At the same time, it is difficult for him to transport his products to the markets in the city or to the collection centers to sell them. In the future, he plans to buy a house in the city, where he can set up a shop that will generate profits for him. He would also like to buy more farms near his present home. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP, and as he is a respectable person in his community bank, he promises to make the payments on time, so that he can continue accessing more credit in the future and not betray the confidence that they have shown in him. With the thousand PEN that he is applying for, he will buy sacks of organic fertilizer, as well as insecticides, which will help him control the pests on his crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":524972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy organic fertilizer and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-17T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunato ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886317}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T07:37:51Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":197566,"name":"Salimatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Salimatou M. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 71 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 04 enfants.

Twenty years ago, when the collapse of Soviet Union took place, people living in the republics within did not even realize the far reaching consequences of this event. One of those consequences was the halt of almost all major industrial factories, which led to the increase in unemployment and deterioration of economic conditions. Consequently people began to leave their homelands in mass for foreign lands in search of jobs and ways of earning a wage. Saidahon T. is the leader of this group. She is thirty two years old. Her husband is working in the  Russian Federation. Every now and then he sends money to his family, which consists of five members: himself , Saidahon and their three children. Their eldest daughter is ten. She has already started helping her mother doing some light work around the house.  Saidahon prefers not to depend on her husband\u2019s support for a living and is engaged in cattle breeding. She also has a cow and sells milk. Saidahon hopes to obtain this loan to purchase wood for building. \r\nSaidahon\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nDiloramhon M., 39, has three children. She trades in foodstuffs. Her husband is a car maintainer. Diloramhon manages to earn 200$ a month. Now she needs this loan to purchase soft drinks and ice - cream. During the summer, this is very profitable trade. \r\n\r\nEtiborhan O., 59, is a widow. She has two children, who live separately. Etiborhan used to work in a hospital, but left because of the  low salary  and started to raise cattle. Now she has two sheep and a cow. Etiborhan hopes to obtain this loan and purchase two calves.\r\n\r\nKuranbaeva N., 31, is a mother of two children. She and her husband are engaged in cattle breeding. Now they have four sheep and a cow. N. decided to apply for this loan as they need funds for building their new house.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

One night in 1988, while living in Mexico City, her 6-month-old son stopped breathing.  Years later in the U.S., Gabriela was working as a childcare provider and enrolled in a CPR course. While helping the instructor to translate the class into Spanish, she realized that with CPR knowledge she might have been able to save her son. \r\n \r\nOver the next few years, Gabriela worked hard to become certified as a CPR instructor and an EMT and began volunteering with the Red Cross to teach in her community.  Most importantly, she taught bilingual classes to make sure her students really understood the information. \r\n \r\nOne year ago, Gabriela officially founded ACC Safety Education. The business is based out of an office and classroom in Redwood City, California, but she and her children, who are both EMTs, also travel to neighboring cities to teach classes. \r\n \r\nGabriela is proud of what she has accomplished and credits her success to the role models in her community. \u201cIn this country, we are blessed to have the example of other women who are successful and strong. We don\u2019t have to listen to traditions that tell us \u2018we can\u2019t do this.\u2019 I don\u2019t care about those traditions anymore. The most people can tell me is \u2018no.\u2019 And then I\u2019ll go and knock on the next door.\u201d  \r\n \r\nGabriela received business coaching from a community partner, who then referred her to Opportunity Fund. A $2,600 loan will help her buy supplies, fix her computer and go to an American Medical Association conference. This small loan will also build her credit and allow her to take out a larger loan in the future to make more extensive business improvements.    \r\n \r\nLooking forward, Gabriela says, \u201cI am concentrating on my business \u2013 it\u2019s my passion. I\u2019d like to have more classes, more clients, and hire more teachers.\u201d \r\n \r\nTo find out more about ACC Safety Education, visit:

She says that she is already well known by many people who buy her products and they are satisfied because they say that the things she sells are very pretty, she sells them at a good price and they like the variety of products which she offers.\r\n\r\nMaria is a new member of the group and she says that this is the first time that she has acquired a loan of this type.  Today she is happy and grateful for the trust that has been placed in her.  She says that she will use this loan to buy more merchandise and she will invest her profits in another business which she has in mind, selling quilts and bedspreads for this season.  Maria fully intends to grow her business and make good profits and also to finish building her house which, for one reason or another, she hasn't yet managed.  She is sure that with the help of the loans she will achieve this goal in the future.  Maria is 52 years old and studied up to the sixth year of elementary school.

I am 46 years old and was widowed a couple of years ago.  The house where I live with my three children was left to me by my husband.  I see my situation as being a little difficult because my children want to continue studying so that they can have a better opportunity of getting work and I want to help them to achieve their goals.  For this reason, I work selling shoes.  I sell the shoes through a catalog and I also sell second-hand shoes in the street market which takes place in our village every Sunday.  This is how I help my children as best I can.  I can't always support them as I would really like.  One of the difficulties I face is that I have to sell my merchandise on credit.  My customers don't always have enough money to pay cash and so I have to wait two weeks for them to get their wages before they pay me the rest of the money they owe me.  I would like my business to work better and I would like to be lucky enough to get ahead in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":751693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Shoes","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-04-21T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":625.06,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":625.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160857},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1249.94,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233735},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512554},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223204},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":625.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201502}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T18:51:24Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":295908,"name":"Demetrio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Demetrio tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad, el vive con su esposa y sus dos menores hijos.

Subhon is 38 years old. He dedicates his time to driving a taxi and a microbus. He currently relies on two vehicles for his public transport business, one of which he drives personally. He rents the microbus. He has a wife and three children. Subhon has about six years of experience in the public transportation field. The competition is rather high in this business because there are so many people who need it. \r\n\r\nHis current request will help him to maintain his vehicle, since this is the tool of his trade. He is counting on your help and requesting a loan of $1200 USD for 12 months. With the loan, he\u2019ll purchase spare parts for his microbus. With your support, Subhon will continue to progress. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
