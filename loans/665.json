She earns her living by operating four business ventures. She sells gasoline, firewood, dried fish, and she also operates a fishing business.  She has no children.  \r\n\r\nEmma joined the Kiva Field Partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $418, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 22,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her businesses.  Emma D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has a one year old baby.  Juli\u00e3o studied until the 10th grade but had to stop when he became gravely ill.  After he recovered he entered into the business world by buying window frames and doors in neighboring Swaziland and re-selling them in the capital of Maputo.  He was able to build his own home and a commercial building.  He later changed jobs when the Mozambique government implemented a law that regulated border activity\u2014in order to monitor contraband on its way to Namaacham or Maputo.  His new job was selling basic products in a small convenience store.  He has never worked with other lending companies and this is his first loan, for 10.000,00MT, which he will use to increase the volume of his products.  He will buy rice, beans, peanuts and sugar.  He makes about 3.000.00MT and is able to save 1.000.00MT, since he is only responsible for his daughter.  He pledges to repay his loan before the determined time and hopes to receive another loan in the future.  He would like to purchase irrigation equipment  and get started in the agricultural field, since there is a large water source and fertile land in his region.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Bacilio lives in the community of Pampa el Coscal, province of Cordillera in the Municipality of Cabezas where he works in agriculture, planting corn and watermelon. His entire crop is sold at the market \"El Torno\" and not in his municipality.

She lives with her two brothers in la Mina Guifarro neighborhood, in the city of Juticalpa in the state of Olancho. She is a young woman who has always had to work since her mother immigrated to the United States illegally and someone had to help out with family expenses. Every weekend she works as a roving saleswoman, offering merchandise such as sandles, cosmetics, women's accessories and clothing. From Monday to Friday she has another job. Ana is asking for a loan because currently she does not have much inventory and she needs to travel to the city of Tegucigalpa to buy merchandise, above all the latest fashions. With the loan she will be able to increase her income because she will obtain more earnings which will allow her to support her brothers, who are both studying. One of the problems that she has had is that her mother is not in good health and she cannot be close to her to offer support. Her hopes are that her mother's health improves, and to have her own space that is large and beautiful to display her products, and for her brothers to have good careers. This is her second loan with FAMA and she has made her payments punctually.\n\nTranslated from Spanish:\nAna Cecilia tiene 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, no tiene hijos, y junto a sus dos hermanos reside en la Colonia Mina Guifarro en la ciudad de Juticalpa, departamento de Olancho. Es una joven que desde temprana edad ha tenido que trabajar porque su madre emigr\u00f3 a Estados Unidos de forma ilegal y alguien ten\u00eda que ayudar con los gastos familiares. Los fines de semana ella se dedica a vender de forma ambulante mercader\u00eda como ser sandalias, cosm\u00e9ticos, accesorios para mujer, y tambi\u00e9n ropa mixta, etc., y de lunes a viernes tiene un empleo fijo. Ana solicita el pr\u00e9stamo porque actualmente no tiene mucho inventario y necesita viajar a la ciudad de Tegucigalpa para comprar mercader\u00eda sobre todo estilos que est\u00e1n a la moda. Con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo ella podr\u00e1 tener mayores ingresos porque obtendr\u00e1 ganancias y con estas apoyar\u00e1 a sus hermanos ya que ambos est\u00e1n estudiando. Una de sus dificultades es que su madre est\u00e1 mal de salud y no puede estar cerca de ella para apoyarla.

He lives in Ica, a city that has recently had a large increase in investment, not only in agricultural exports - in other words, large farms - but also in the opening of new commercial centers that bring many jobs to regular citizens of Ica. In his free time, Mario Alberto enjoys building houses. Peru is well known for having some of the most delicious foods int he world, and one of the dishes that Mario Alberto enjoys is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" (a combination of a pasta dish and a beef or pork stew that are often served together). Mario Alberto studied until the fifth year of secondary school, and he would have liked to have studied veterinary medicine. He lives with his partner, who is the head of the household, and they have two children together. The younger child is three years old and attends an early education center; the older child is 17 years old, and he is in the fifth year of secondary school.\r\n\r\nMario Alberto is a master construction worker, always working efficiently and responsibly. He works about nine hours a day. His friends encouraged him to go into this type of work, and because of the earthquake in 2007, the need for skilled construction workers has increased.In one day, he can attend to one client, and because of the complexity of the labor involved, he is able to earn an average of 52 soles (roughly 20 USD); on a good day, he could early 100 soles (roughly 38 USD), which helps him with a few additional household expenses. His business is successful because he does his work in a responsible and honorable way, and because of this, many people comment on his good work and recommend him to others. Now, Mario Alberto hopes that Kiva lenders can help him to be able to buy more tools, and with these tools offer better service and not have to rent necessary tools. Mario Alberto will repay the loan in six months.\r\n\r\nThis improvement of having good tools will help him in his daily work, and in this way, he will be able to increase his income to improve his family's quality of life.

She also says, \u201cno work, no life\u201d as she and her husband are daily wage earners and their source of income is unreliable and irregular based, mainly on work availability and appropriate workload. She is the featured borrower for Dorcas Lom Group and she is pictured with her hand raised.  Her kids are in the capital town to study in good schools as the village does not have a good school. Her husband is a farmer and works in a paddy field. During off farming season, he usually sieves sand and digs underneath the riverbank for massive stones and sells them at a good price. It is completely manual work and takes a hard toil on the labourer. Deprived of all basic education, both Lhingkhochong and her husband work hard to manage the family expenses with all available work.\r\n\r\nLhingkhochong's main source of income is selling her own vegetable produce. She usually plants all seasonal vegetables and sell them after a period of four months, when the plants are fully grown. Her other income-generating activity is selling rice in the village and nearby villages. The rice supply is bought from the neighbouring state and sold in the town market and also in the village. The generated income is meager and can\u2019t provide enough capital to start her livestock farming business, which had been her plan for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan Lhingkhochong  plans to purchase two does and two bucks when she accesses the loan. Her plan is to rear the young goats while she is working in the fields and sell them when they mature. With the income she also aspires to start a charcoal business which is one of the highest demands in the area. It is non-seasonal and has no threat of expiration which is a very good option for generating income for them.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful support, enabling the group members to fulfill their desires and plans. She says she will always remain obliged and will also repay the loan on time. She also made a request that Kiva will continue helping them and hopes the co-operation will be a grand success.

Her husband had passed away and Juana was left with the responsibility for her children. She looked for various alternatives to earn money and this was the best way to accommodate her needs, because she can also care for her children while she works. This is a better life, and Juana enjoys sales. First Juana began washing and ironing clothing and cleaning the houses of her neighbors, plus a couple of other activities that combined, earned enough income to support her children. In April 2002 Juana began to sell used clothing when her son, who lives in the U.S., sent her boxes of used clothing. She sold them, and was able to support her other children and help her grandchildren. Thanks to a previous loan with Kiva, Juana could buy more boxes of clothing. Now she'd like to buy used clothing for autumn and winter. \r\n\r\nJuana needs a loan of US $400, which she'll repay in 5 months. She'll use the money to buy more boxes of clothing so as to offer better supplies to her clients and increase her sales and income. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":213229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T11:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T14:44:58Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5279983},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891772},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-24T08:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14815002},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349807},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037093}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T14:44:58Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T09:02:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":73469,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience O. sells yams at Use market in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria.

She married, and the fruit of this union is the four children she had. Confident that the sale of beers and sodas would generate a good income, she began a business two years ago. Her good relations, courtesy and the joy that she transmits brought in customers, and demand grew, exceeding her goals and increasing her workload. Trinidad has new goals, including the installation of a bar in the center of her district. She is looking for a location in an attractive neighborhood with a lot of recreation and shopping centers so that she will benefit from the numbers of people.

He started his career by making tailor-made shirts and pants; over the years his business has expanded.\r\n<p> \r\nMr. R. is requesting a loan to buy zippers (in every color), cloth and shoe soles, which would supply him with the materials necessary to take care of customer demands at a moment's notice. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan he will be able to buy a larger quantity of materials from Santa Elena (a local wholesale vendor) at a discounted rate.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to buy sheet metal to secure the roof of his shop. He dreams of one day being a material's distributor to other tailors in the city. \r\n<p>\r\nHe is grateful for any support we can provide his business so that his family may prosper!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":424104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy cloth, zippers and shoe soles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-11-13T00:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Praxedes Litardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":41.57,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679517},{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":46.57,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074027},{"amount":47.75,"local_amount":47.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":47.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909994},{"amount":49.62,"local_amount":49.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":49.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945559},{"amount":50.23,"local_amount":50.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673922},{"amount":164.26,"local_amount":164.26,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708088}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T22:09:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Willard","image":null}},{"id":155580,"name":"Naomi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naomi T. is a 56-year-old woman living in the town of Auala 2.

He is 36 years old. Victorio is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Victorio owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Victorio has been engaged in his business for years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Victorio joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victorio is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Victorio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 48 years old. Erlinda is married and has 9 adult-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store.

Malipayon, Brgy. Banago, Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Roel S., who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 9 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nAntonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. The additional working capital from her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future and send her children to school. Antonieta S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The members decided to give the group this name because they are ardent devotees of the saint San Judi\u00edtas who they celebrate through a yearly fiesta.  This group has eleven indigenous members who have dreams and ambitions.  They want to achieve their dreams through hard work and honesty.  They are people who are full of hopes and have goals to reach.  They are unassuming people and good friends to each other.  This is a group that would like to fulfil their dreams so that they can help their children to study and earn a living without forgetting their roots and origins.\r\n\r\nCarlos is the person who invited the other members to join this group as they are all neighbors and friends.  Carlos is 39 years old.  He works as a mechanic and has business premises which are one block from his home.  His son Ernesto helps him when he gets home from school as he really enjoys this work.  Carlos taught him to repair cars and recognize their parts and their purpose from a very young age.\r\n\r\nCarlos requested this loan to buy more spare parts as his stock is low and occasionally people come to buy parts from him and he doesn't have them.  He doesn't want to lose customers owing to a lack of parts.\r\n\r\nOne of Carlos' dreams is to have more merchandise in his repair shop as his customers trust what he sells them and the work that he does.  For their sake he would like to buy more merchandise and not have to delay the work that they provide him with.\r\n\r\nCarlos is very happy because every day he gains more customers who he provides with the service that they deserve.  This means that he can provide his wife Clara and his son Ernesto the best.  They both support him in the decisions that he makes.\r\n\r\nCarlos thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they have given both to himself and his fellow group members so that they can get ahead and fulfil their dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":858122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-07T08:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis   Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Librada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anayeli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Clemencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":53000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1335.94,"local_amount":16562.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":16624.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807681},{"amount":1068.75,"local_amount":13250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":13299.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618778},{"amount":1068.75,"local_amount":13250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13299.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573019},{"amount":801.56,"local_amount":9937.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9974.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784742}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T12:25:38Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":336561,"name":"Youssef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Youssef is a 45-year-old Lebanese married man and the father of three children.

A. is a citizen of the city of Yavan. He is 32 years old, married and has four children. He is unemployed. He earns an income by raising large-horned cattle and selling milk. Two of his cows have given birth so it is important that he increases the size of his cow barn. That is why he wants to receive a loan so that he can buy building materials. By building a strong cow barn he will be able to be well prepared for the winter and not worry that the cold weather would injure the cows. He plans to repay the loan within 12 months.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432

She has two children ages two and 18 years old.  Her oldest child is in school.  Her husband is a construction worker who works independently and is also sometimes contracted.  Veronica has worked as a domestic worker for over 20 years for different families.  She was given the opportunity to work as a domestic worker when she was a single mother who had been abandoned by her husband.  She had to pay for the necessities and this work has, until this day, allowed her to support her family.  Luckily she remarried and she now has a family.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cooking oil, sugar and kerosene","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027593},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613594},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010673},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232959},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664750},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105470},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022615},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867864},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757065},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146177}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Sutcliffe","image":null}},{"id":98061,"name":"Fortunata","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia FORTUNATA;

Saidakram is dedicated to agriculture and the sale of home-grown vegetables, which means that he can be around his family, helping to raise their quality of life and educate all his three children. Saidakram has been characterized as a person who is hard-working, since he has been working in agriculture since he was very young. This kind of work requires effort, dedication and above all, strength, as it can include heavy work, meaning that people get tired quickly. In spite of this, Saidakram is determined to raise the standard of living in his family, and to improve the quality of the seeds he cultivates. For this reason, he is asking for help in order to be able to receive more credit from IMON International.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

su esposa que es la madre de sus 5 hijos, de los cuales viven con tres de ellos que lo apoyan en los trabajos agr\u00edcolas. La siembra y cosecha de papa es la actividad a la que se dedica diariamente desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, pero antes de acudir a su chacra alimenta a los animales que tiene como su burro y sus mulas, los cuales le son muy \u00fatiles para transportar los sacos durante la cosecha. Por ello que a  las 8.00am sus animales ya deben estar bien alimentados para que no sientan cansancio ni hambre durante la jornada de ida y vuelta a su almac\u00e9n. Despu\u00e9s de haber acumulado las papas, comienza la selecci\u00f3n con la ayuda de su esposa, y finalmente los transporta al mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma. Milcerio ama la labor que realiza, puesto que sabe que gracias a ella obtendr\u00e1 el dinero para sostener a su familia. En los 30 a\u00f1os que lleva en esta actividad ha disfrutado de la abundancia de sus cosechas que le permitieron vivir temporadas de bonaza, como tambi\u00e9n de impotencia al ver que sus siembras se quedaban bajo el hielo y otras veces los gusanos malograban la totalidad de sus cultivos, pero esas circunstancias s\u00f3lo han sido pasajeras, pues no han mellado en su \u00e1nimo de seguir luchando para mantener a su familia. Este es el cuarto cr\u00e9dito de Milcerio con MFP, durante los anteriores ciclos demostr\u00f3 mucha responsabilidad en sus pagos, y para este ciclo se compromete seguir la misma din\u00e1mica, ya que los dem\u00e1s integrantes son muy buenos colaboradores para el progreso de su banco comunal. Los dos mil soles que solicita ser\u00e1n invertidos en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, para sus pr\u00f3ximas siembras.","en":"<p>Milcerio is 46 years old, he is a very sensible and responsible man. He lives happily with his wife, the mother of his 5 children, three of whom are still with them and help him work the fields. He sows and harvests potatoes, daily work that he has been carrying out for the last 30 years. But even before he starts tending to his fields he must feed the his donkey and his mules. They help him transport the large sacks of harvest.  By 8a.m. the animals must already be well fed so that they do not feel tired or become hundre during the trip to and from the silos. After having collected the potatoes he and his wife must go through a selection process, and only then will they transport them to the wholesale markets in the city of Tarma. Miclerio loves his work and it is thanks to this work that he obtains money to support his family. In the 30 years that he has been working he has enjoyed abundant harvests, giving him the opportunity to live through times of plenty. He has also seen harvests fall under a sheet of ice and other harvests that were completely spoiled by pests. But these times of hardship have been temporary and they have not impeded his will to keep struggling for the sake of his family. This is the fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). In the past he has shown great responsibility in his payments and for this time around he promises to be equally responsible. The others inthe group are wonderful collaborators in the progress of their community bank. The two thousand soles he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for this next harvest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":323698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T12:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milcerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641245}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T15:18:38Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":114445,"name":"Elisa Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Elisa Margarita L.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":363363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of motorbike, licensing, documentation ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

She is 40 years old, separated from her spouse, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop in the local community, selling clothes, shoes and other personal needs in addition to both food and daily use products. Delia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $125 a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Delia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nDelia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 14th loan from HSPFI. She chose to lower her loan request from 20,000 PHP to 5,000 PHP because she finds it easier to pay back. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Su negocio le enorgullece que entre m\u00e1s tiempo pasa lo van recomendando m\u00e1s y viene gente incluso de otros pueblos a rentarles. Un momento muy especial para ella fue cuando compraron las primeras mesas y sillas para rentar las utilizaron para la fiesta de los tres a\u00f1os de su hijo. Nos menciona que su negocio es popular porque aunque vengan de lejos ellos les dan servicio al precio. Algunos de los problemas que enfrenta es que a veces se le pierde al cliente y se los tienen que cobrar; no tienen competencia en su localidad y eso les facilita el trabajo.

Mart\u00ednez lives in the City of Moyotepec, located in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  She\u2019s 35 years old, has completed junior high school and has her diploma.  She runs a business where she rents out tables, tablecloths, and chairs and will use the money from this loan to buy more tablecloths to grow her business.\r\n\r\nShe found out about Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through a friend who invited her to participate in a local group.  Her business is called \u201cCasa Vargas,\u201d and she and her husband have had it for eight years.  When they returned from working in the United States eight years ago, they didn\u2019t know how to invest the money that they had.  A friend told them that it would be a good idea to invest in tables and chairs to rent out, so they acquired the items they needed to start the business.  Before starting this business, [Leticia] had sold clothing, but that business was not in her best interest.\r\n\r\nShe runs the business out of her home, where she attends to the customers and her husband delivers the tables and tablecloths in his van.  She considers her business to be very important because it provides the money for their major expenses, as well as for their daily ones.  The biggest challenge is in servicing large contracts because it is a lot of work.\r\n\r\nThey are proud that their business is recommended more and more as time passes, and people come from all around, even from other towns, to rent from them.  A special moment for her was when they bought their first tables and chairs to rent out.  They used them for their three year old son\u2019s birthday party.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that her business is popular because, even though people come from far away, they give good service at good prices.  One of the problems they face is that sometimes the customers lose the items and they have to charge them.  They don\u2019t have any competition in the local area, so it makes things easier.\r\n\r\nShe believes that in the future they will buy more items for their business; round tables and seat covers, so that they will look more presentable, and feels that she will be able to do it from the extra income facilitated by this loan.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and her husband works as a private English teacher.  She has two children; nine year old Sergio who attends elementary school, and three year old Cynthia.  Her husband helps by delivering and picking up the tables.  She thinks that her business is important because, even though they invested a lot of money up front, it now provides them with a good income.  She tells us that she wants to add a second floor to her home, complete with more bedrooms for their kids.  Her hopes are that they can provide an education for their children through their business and effort.\r\n\r\nShe tells us that when she gets the loan she feels very happy and committed because she knows that she needs to invest in her business, give better service to her customers, and repay her loan.  Leticia wants to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cIt\u2019s great that you loan the money because the interest is low and you help the businesses.\u201d  She likes Moyotepec, the place where she lives, very much because the landscape is very peaceful, one can see many trees, and the people there raise corn and sugar cane.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":681187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Tablecloths","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T21:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2667.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430794},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1778.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850052},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1778.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292325},{"amount":71.87,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":889.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160590}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T02:16:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy thread, a sewing machine, and kangas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027601},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613602},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010681},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232967},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664758}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T20:36:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Naegeli","image":264373}},{"id":98077,"name":"Sarwari M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They have 3 children. They live in the community of Sirenachayocc, located in the Peruvian forest of Cusco where they have their own wooden house. Ida is a woman with a winning mentality. She assures that \"her father taught her to work in order to have a better future\". At 24 she had her first child, her only support being her partner, which gave her motives to achieve her goals. Now she produces and sells cocoa and she competes well with the other producers at the market. Her sales has been increasing constantly, and her product is well accepted in her community. She thinks that she has succeded in the first step and now she needs to maintain her position through hard work and self-esteem. Usually her product is sold at the collection centers of her community at a good price. Her partner supports her and together they make decisions related to the marketing. Ida wants to own a store to sell clothes, as there is a need in her community. This is her second loan with MFP, and she promises to continue being punctual with the payments. She also mentions the good teamwork they have in her community group. With the loan she will invest in increasing her production on land that has not been in use and therefore she needs to buy good quality cocoa seeds as well as fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":549434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cocoa seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-07T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":98.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":101.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":105.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":108.53},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":112.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":115.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.1},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.98},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.1,"local_amount":83.14,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":83.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934591},{"amount":31.35,"local_amount":89.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":89.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673362},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":90.64,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":90.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887186},{"amount":32.88,"local_amount":93.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":94.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154198},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":98.14,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":98.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449507},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":101.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":101.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588187},{"amount":37.01,"local_amount":105.72,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":106.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724734},{"amount":37.98,"local_amount":108.53,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":108.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462946},{"amount":39.47,"local_amount":112.76,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":113.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886459},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":115.95,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":116.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326764}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T04:03:07Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":209547,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard M. is from the village of Talon Gingoog City.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married to Juana, 38, with whom he has four children who are all grown up and no longer depend on Manuel. He tells us that he has a business which he has called 'Cartonera familiar' ('Family Cardboard Collection'), because they produce cardboard sheets and members of his family work for the company.\r\n\r\nHe says that he wanted to start this business so that he would not be so dependent on the factory and so that he could offer this product to his customers. On this occasion, he asked for the loan to buy raw materials like paper, cardboard and newspapers, which he buys to make the cardboard sheets. The manufacturing process uses a cardboard pulp, obtained by mashing together all the collected paper, which is put out to dry in the sun. One of the challenges Manuel faces is when the cardboard doesn't dry because it rains or the sun doesn't come out, but he doesn't see this as a reason to lose motivation.\r\n\r\nManuel has been doing this job for 11 years and hopes that his business will grow stronger so that he doesn't have to ask for any more loans. However, he is very grateful for the loan he is being given to help him to build his business and gain more customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":851733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials like cardboard, paper and newspapers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-07T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":729.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":774.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":807.52},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":854.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":894.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":940.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.98,"local_amount":729.12,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":771.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807687},{"amount":65.82,"local_amount":774.4,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":819.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618784},{"amount":63.92,"local_amount":751.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":795.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573025},{"amount":72.61,"local_amount":854.19,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":903.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784747},{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":551.4,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":583.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193381},{"amount":109.96,"local_amount":1293.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1368.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263329828},{"amount":3.84,"local_amount":45.21,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":47.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044567}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T15:11:04Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:39:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":336593,"name":"Dalal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dalal is a 33-year-old young woman.

Rahma has been running 2 businesses, a charcoal business and a cloth shop, since March 2008. \r\n<p>\r\nAt her mkaa (charcoal) business, she sells charcoal, which are small, black pieces of dry earth that are used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange charcoal, and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she has established a shop that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all 4 sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n<p>\r\nShe splits her time between both business working 1-4 hours a day, 7 days a week at each business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy medicines for a pharmacy business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T23:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027607},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613608},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010687},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232973},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664764}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T18:03:46Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":98093,"name":"Emelina Nancy,","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nDesde hace siete a\u00f1os que Nancy maneja una bodega de abarrotes.

S. is a member of the Cruz de Motupe II Village Bank. She lives in an unnumbered house on the corner of Los Trigales Street and Acacia Street in a small, rented apartment. She is 31 years old and lives with her partner and their son, who is still a dependent. Her partner sells hardware items. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan of 300 soles, Sandra bought Unique and Esita brand cosmetics, which she sold to her friends. Today, she feels very much supported by the Manuela Ramos Movement for having placed its trust in her even though she isn't originally from the area (she is from Lima, but has been living in Huaraz for the past seven years since she decided that Huaraz and the Callejon de Huaylas Valley have a superior market). With this loan of 500 soles, Sandra will buy bedspreads to fill orders that have already been placed by her clients and friends. She is committed to the Manuela Ramos Movement and to her village bank because they have supported her financially and have given her the opportunity to belong to a group of women. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":323784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy bedspreads","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huaraz - Ancash","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.533333 -77.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":131.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44591076},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:48Z","rounded_local_amount":131.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985362},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":131.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205776},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":131.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635003}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T17:33:51Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":114477,"name":"Rafiqa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rafiqa M. is a married mother of three children.

This area is located an hour from the city of Cuenca, and the land is environmentally sensitive.  The primary crops of the region are:  corn, beans, barley, wheat, peas, and potatoes.  In the lower sections, sugar cane and fruit trees are grown.\r\n\r\nThe town is surrounded by silver and iron mines to the north and south, and in the south there are also lime pits.  Agriculture is the primary industry, and many also dedicate themselves to producing hand-made straw hats.  \r\n\r\nThis cooperative bank is comprised of people that are very collaborative, organized, and punctual.  Carrying out farming tasks is the fundamental base for their companionship, and when anyone needs assistance they all come together as a group to help.  They also work together during festivals.\r\n\r\nMariam is 24 years old, and has 3 children ages 7, 5 and 3.  The two oldest study at the school in Ruizho.  She lives in her parents\u2019 home, is single, and has been a member of the bank for a long time.  This is her fourth loan, and she has dedicated herself since a young girl to raising chickens.  This is a familiar arena for her, given that her whole family is in the same business.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting today is to invest in chickens and feed.  She tells us that she wants to acquire three boxes of chickens, which each have 100 chickens in them.  They are one day old and cost $84 USD per box.  The time to raise and fatten them is 8 weeks, until they reach about 6 pounds approximately.\r\n\r\nShe has a stall at the markets of CREA and Paradise, where she sells her chickens whole and by the pound.  She sells them for $1.25 USD per pound, and if it\u2019s a different type of chicken (yellow Cuban) they cost $1.50 USD per pound.\r\n\r\nHer life\u2019s goal is to have her own home and live independently, and to continue managing her own business given that, these days, everyone must contribute equally. \r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

Guti\u00e9rrez, 46, lives in Barranquilla\u2019s El Pueblo neighborhood, a popular, cheerful, high-spirited neighborhood in the southwestern part of the city which, sadly, is infamous due to flooding during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has three children, the youngest of whom are a 17-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter.  Bertilda makes snacks like deditos (little finger-shaped pastries) and turnovers.  She sells the larger deditos in stores and the smaller ones are ordered by people for parties and other special events. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a $1.800.000 loan to buy ingredients like wheat flour, cooking oil, sugar and cheese so that she can increase production and add more stores and schools to her distribution points list. \r\n\r\nBertilda started her business 8 years ago when she moved from her mother-in-law\u2019s house to a different neighborhood, El Pueblo.  She learned from her mother, \u201ca woman who knows how to do everything,\u201d and passed it on to her children.  When the need arose to help her husband with household expenses, she turned to the manufacture of snacks.  Her husband delivers door-to-door and sometimes helps her take the product to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe has been associated with the Fundaci\u00f3n for about 4 years and she states that she is better off financially because she\u2019s been able to improve her house: she tiled the kitchen floor and considers this to be very important to her business because it\u2019s more hygienic and attracts more customers.\r\n\r\nShe says that her greatest challenge is the lack of capital and remembers that there was a time when she had the opportunity to sell her products to casinos but lack of capital then kept her from doing so.\r\n\r\nDespite drop in sales during this season, she knows that everything will improve the next few months.\r\n\r\nShe wants to attract more customers in order to progress and reach her goal of helping her children become professionals so that they can live better.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Entre Nohora y su esposo lograron que su negocio se diera a conocer con los vecinos por la gran variedad y las formas diferentes de presentaci\u00f3n de sus pizzas, y por la manera familiar y respetuosa con que siempre han tratado a sus clientes.

Both work there.  They started it five years ago with their savings and with family assets, such as a blender, an ice machine, a table and the support of some of their neighbors who helped them get into a location.  Nohora and her husband were able to make their business well known with their neighbors for the great variety and different methods of presentation for their pizzas and for the friendly way that they serve their customers.  Nohora says that her business, \u201cPizzer\u00eda Piazalla\u201d may be thought of as a fast food restaurant, but they don\u2019t consider it as such.  Each pizza is unique and prepared to order, and always fresh.  Nohora also realizes that her pizzeria is located in a poor neighborhood, so they offer quality, much like the larger establishments.  This has been part of their success.\r\n\r\nThis will be their first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y Nohora and they are requesting a loan for 2,300,000 COP ($1,200) in order to buy ingredients such as wheat, sugar, and soft drinks.  They will also invest in an advertising campaign to increase their market share, now that they have moved from their original location and have acquired a location across from the home of their in-laws.  They invested two months and all of their savings in preparing the location.  Now they must begin again because they have gotten disconnected from their customers.  This is a setback, but they have new products and have extended their business hours in order to become well know once more.  Their dream is to establish a solid economic base so that they can secure a good education for their children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

They live together in the beautiful Peruvian tropical rainforest, located in the community of Sirenachayocc, where they have their own house, which is made of wood.  Growing up, the main source of income for her family was farming, but due to constant road closures they could not sell any of their products. So, unfortunately, they lost what they had invested. Maximiliana was 9 years old then, but enduring the problems and economic crises that she faced alongside her family shaped her into a woman of character.  Now she produces cocoa and sells it at the collection and distribution centers in her community. In addition, Maximiliana has a great deal of experience in the proper management of farm products. She is passing on her knowledge to her children with the assurance that they will later assume their parents\u2019 legacy in the proper way. She knows that the sales of her product provide her with good income which is why she hopes to expand her cocoa plantations in the future, and build a more substantial house in order to improve the quality of life for her family. This is her second loan with MFP, which is why she is committed to continue meeting her respective payments. In addition, she feels good about being a member of her communal group.  With the loan she is requesting, she will invest in proper maintenance of her cocoa plantations, and purchase supplies and fertilizer, in order to improve the quality and quantity of this product. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Francoletti-Putz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":549465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of supplies and fertilizer for her cocoa plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":124.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":136},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":140.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":147.27},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":158.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":162.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":169.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":173.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.66,"local_amount":124.75,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934594},{"amount":47.04,"local_amount":134.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":134.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673365},{"amount":47.6,"local_amount":136,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":136.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887189},{"amount":49.34,"local_amount":140.97,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154201},{"amount":51.54,"local_amount":147.27,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":147.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449510},{"amount":53.36,"local_amount":152.47,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":153.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588190},{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":158.63,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":159.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724737},{"amount":57,"local_amount":162.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":163.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462949},{"amount":59.22,"local_amount":169.19,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":169.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886462},{"amount":60.72,"local_amount":173.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":174.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326767}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T16:37:09Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":209563,"name":"Mrs. Pha Ngan Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan consists of nineteen people who live in Ta Ei village in Takeo province.

She lives with her husband and the youngest of their children.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, she decided to exploit as much as possible the resources she has in her land, which is rich in clay.  This was very good for making bricks.  Since then she has mass-produced them.  She also needed to hire labor, especially people who are experts in brickmaking.  As for marketing, she takes care of it herself, offering her bricks for sale at several places in the city.  She sells on average 20,000 bricks per month, which helps her cover family expenses.  She says her business is profitable because there is high demand for bricks; for this reason she plans to buy more clay-rich land in the future so she can continue making more bricks. \r\n\r\nThis is Francisca's tenth loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support since she has always shown herself to be responsible about her payments.  She is also grateful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible people and are very supportive.  She thanks the people who will be managing the loan she is requesting, and the loan will be very helpful to her in her business's progress.  The loan she is requesting will help her buy materials she needs for brickmaking.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":573927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of brickmaking materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T00:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":99.75,"local_amount":266,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":281.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887444},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":140.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154446},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":140.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449755},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":140.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588457},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":142.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724959}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T03:57:30Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":221853,"name":"Albert Kyalo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Albert is a 34-year-old married man with two children.
