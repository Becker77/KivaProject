\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells basic goods like rice, vegetable oil, floor, spaghetti, juice, bread and so forth. She started her business two years ago in order to deal with the family's financial issues. She also sells charcoal (obtained by heating wood), since in her community not all the people have sufficient means to use gas. Women in Don Juan use the charcoal to soften up peas, because peas take a long time to be well-cooked and that consumes a lot of gas. The entrepreneur requests a loan to wholesale purchase the goods she usually sells in her business, as she is short of supply.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

F. is 20 years old and has just recently opened her own business selling new women's and children's clothing. When Edita first began selling clothing eight months ago, she found it difficult to obtain capital to invest in her business. And so, two weeks ago, she opted to take out her first loan from Kiva and Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nWith this new access to capital and credit, Edita will finally be able to buy larger quantities of merchandise, including women's tops, blouses, and pants and children's clothing. With her new loan, Edita hopes to begin selling women's shoes and sandals as well.\r\n\r\nOnce her loan is fully funded, Edita will travel several hours by bus (called a guagua) to the larger city of Higuey on the eastern coast to buy her merchandise. She will then sell her wares to her neighbors in the Villa Guerrero neighborhood of El Seybo, which lies in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nRevenues from Edita's clothing business will help supplement what her husband earns working for a local construction company, and will also support the family's two children: a 4-year-old son and a 3-month-old daughter.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the family lives in relatively difficult circumstances: they have no electricity in the home, and the 3-month-old girl currently has an untreated skin infection over much of her body. Furthermore, the family, like the majority of their neighbors in Villa Guerrero, is of Haitian descent, which means it is generally more difficult for them to secure economic and political rights as compared to Dominican citizens.\r\n\r\nWith these challenges in mind, Edita recognizes the importance of her clothing business to her family's well-being. She has hopes to keep selling more clothing in the future so that her children may eventually attend school and have better lives.\r\n\r\nHere, Edita is pictured with her fellow borrowers in La Buena Fe (The Good Faith) Bank of Hope, Group 11. She appears second from the left, along with her daughter.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily used products in the local community. Rammynel has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rammynel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rammynel is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP to be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rammynel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout HSPFI:\n\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She sells various products including books, clothing for children as well as for adults, cleaning products and personal hygiene products. She also has a photocopying machine.\r\n\r\nTeresita plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of inventory that she will sell in her store. She says that her lack of access to working capital (i.e. loans from formal lending institutions) has hindered her ability to expand her business, gain more clients and increase revenues.\r\n\r\nTeresita organizes her day in the following manner: she wakes up early and cleans the house and store. If a client passes by, she opens up (no earlier than 6 a.m.) and the day begins. She stays open all day until 8 p.m.\r\n\r\nTeresita\u2019s main goal is to expand her business, fill her store with a variety of products and increase her revenues. A main obstacle for Teresita is that she lives in a rural area with a small population, which makes clients hard to come

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rustam has been in this business for two years.  He chose this business because it has more interaction.  He know that fabrics are always in demand for women, and he always gets his wife's advise on the choice and demand of fabrics at the market.

Thi Tran, 50 years old, joined the Fund in 2004.  She saw that joining the Fund means that her family would have the chance to grow financially.  In every round of funding, she put the loan towards the livestock business.  Although the family\u2019s livestock venture is not very big, it still brings them a steady annual income.  Besides raising livestock, in her free time Mrs. Tran weaves baskets to sell for extra money.  She has four children, one of which is grown and has established his own family and three who live at home.  All her children have jobs and stable incomes; with these multiple incomes the family\u2019s ability to repay the loans is very good.  In this round of funding she and the family is requesting 6,000,000 VND to invest in raising pigs.  Their average income is 4,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Ph\u00fac 50 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2004, ch\u1ecb th\u1ea5y r\u1eb1ng tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 l\u00e0 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 c\u01a1 h\u1ed9i ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf, c\u00e1c v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng v\u00e0o m\u1ee5c \u0111\u00edch ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, vi\u1ec7c ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb tuy kh\u00f4ng l\u1edbn nh\u01b0ng c\u0169ng \u0111em l\u1ea1i thu nh\u1eadp h\u00e0ng n\u0103m cho gia \u0111\u00ecnh, ngo\u00e0i vi\u1ec7c ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i nh\u1eefng l\u00fac nh\u00e0n d\u1ed7i ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m th\u00eam ngh\u1ec1 \u0111an th\u00fang cho thu nh\u1eadp th\u00eam.

Tort M., 26, lives in Pursat province, Cambodia where she owns a farmland that she inherited from her grandparents. The farmland is used to grow crops, which she plants twice a year. She is a good mother of one lovely young child who is enrolled in school.

She is identified by these traits in the town where she has lived for the past 20 years with her husband and three children. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a very gifted cook.  Ever since she was very young, she has been known for her food's delicious flavors.  Her friends began to ask for her services for social events and celebrations.  Ever since then, she has run her business of cooking and selling food.  A few months ago, she was able to open a popular diner where many members of the community go to eat; she serves them with the help of a few of her neighbors.  Mar\u00eda considers her business to be profitable because the cost of food supplies is low and the demand of her product is high.  For these reasons, her future plans are to continue furnishing the diner with some additional tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers, whose number seems to grow every day. \r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She knows that the responsibility of her payments supports the work that she does and the commitment that she has with her community bank, where she has been a member for more than 5 years. With the money she is asking for now, she would be able to invest in the purchase of merchandise (foodstuffs) that she needs in order to continue preparing her tasty dishes.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Colleen  Godfrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":414875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of foodstuffs for the preparation of her dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-27T06:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":105.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":110.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":116.91},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":121.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":129.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":132.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":139.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":144.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":105.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843103},{"amount":75.68,"local_amount":216.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":216.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734681},{"amount":3.94,"local_amount":11.26,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":11.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124070},{"amount":42.4,"local_amount":121.16,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":121.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959752},{"amount":45.25,"local_amount":129.28,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":129.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992608},{"amount":46.48,"local_amount":132.81,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":132.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717388},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":139.41,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":139.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751175},{"amount":50.47,"local_amount":144.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":144.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933731}],"funded_date":"2009-10-27T11:46:06Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Colleen  Godfrey","image":null}},{"id":151986,"name":"Chum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chum S. is 30 years of age and currently lives in the Siem Reap province of Cambodia.

She is 35 and married with six school-aged children. To make a living, Elsa owns and operates a business venture raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and raising pigs for sale. She also buys and sells coconuts, fruits & vegetables.

Elsa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI which she used to purchase additional livestock and as working capital. Elsa is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is age 50 and married.

His farm currently produces milk, bananas and mangoes for the local market. He also runs a retail shop dealing in cereals.\r\n\r\nSilas made a loan request with Juhudi Kilimo amounting to 25,000 KES to purchase poultry birds and spread his risk from dairy farming, which has been his main source of income.

The earnings from this activity will allow her to better care for her children. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDivorc\u00e9e avec son mari il y a 2 ans, Madame M.

This is Amina R.. She is a 38-year-old widow, and she has one 18-year-old child. In 1999, Amina established her egg business. Working six days a week, and 5 to 8 hours a day, she earns about $210 each month from this business. She is assisted by her child and  two employees. Amina has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase 200 trays of eggs. In the future, Amina plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":140716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional (200 trays) eggs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-19T16:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T18:09:36Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200097},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227091},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256331},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285072},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315265},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346838},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:32Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347580},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970200},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886450},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435735}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T18:09:36Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45341,"name":"Liba\u00f1a","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Liba\u00f1a belongs to the Communal Bank The Family, located in the Av.

Oinisa is a 20-year-old who has been working the land for 3 years. Her husband has no fixed job, which means they have no other steady monthly income. They have a little son, their pride and joy, who is learning the best life lessons from his parents.<P>\r\n\r\nTheir biggest source of income is the fruit of their labor; they grow potatoes and onions. Oinisa is proud of the quality of her crops and of her knowledge. While waiting for the best moment of production, she is requesting a loan in order to maintain her crops, holding off on the harvest until the market indicates that it is the best time to yield the biggest profits. Her dream is to acquire more land and produce more crops in the future because the land that she loves and has been a part of her life has allowed her to move her family forward. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They sell a variety of products, as well as doing some catering, and are on their second group loan, having repaid the first without any difficulty. This loan will be used to buy 5 pieces of \"pagne wax\" (a West African term for highly decorative and colourful fabric), 3 woollen blankets, 3 bedcovers, 65 items of clothing for children (dresses, trouser suits, skirt suits and baby clothes), food seasonings (150 bowls of powder made from the Baobab  - or monkey bread -  tree, 50 bowls of chili peppers, 1\/2 a carton of dried fish, 6 packets of Maggi chicken stock cubes and 60 pieces of potash) 3 bags of groundnut, 5 baskets of fresh fish and 5 cartons of soaps.

They sell the children's clothing while walking around the neighbourhoods of Darsalam and Hamdallaye, and the other goods are sold at the Ch\u00e2teau market, apart from the woollen blankets and bedcovers which are sold to people in their homes. The goods are sold for either cash or credit to a customer base made up of both men and women. They are expecting to make a monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA which will be used for the repayment of loans, but also to contribute to family expenses and social events.

When the economy, way of life, and ideology of the post-Soviet countries began to change, the most farsighted people immediately recognized the necessity of taking up private enterprise. The heroes of this story were such people; the majority of them decided to work at the market.\r\n\r\nMayramkul M. is the leader of this group. Together with her family Mayramkul lives in the city of Karabalta. Mayramkul has three children: a son and two daughters. Mayramkul and her husband found their niche in animal husbandry. They decided to fatten and re-sell livestock and they have been in the business for the last six years. When they were starting out, they sold their cow to buy two bull-calves and fatten them up. Today they have an income of about 14 thousand som from the re-sale of animals. In the last few years they have been able to buy a car and through this business they have the means to send their youngest daughter to the university, paying her tuition. The oldest son is working in South Korea; the middle daughter is married; the youngest daughter is studying at a university and working as a hairdresser. Mayramkul and her husband need the loan to buy a cow for re-sale on the market. In the future they plan to build a large house.\r\n\r\nMayramkul has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nBakytbek T. is 42 years old. Bakytbek's wife went to Russia to earn money. Bakytbek is the father of two grown children. The son works in construction, the daughter is in college. Bakytbek himself is a carpenter and sells objects made of wood such as handles for axes, dough rollers, and cutting boards. Bakytbek needs the loan to buy construction materials.\r\n\r\nSalima A. is 42 years old; she is the mother of four children. Salima's husband works as a loader at the market. Her daughters work in a sewing shop; one of her sons goes to school and the other is a preschooler. Salima sells potatoes and is requesting the loan to purchase potatoes to sell.\r\n\r\nAzizakhan A. is 42 years old. Together with her husbans she sells vegetables at the market. Azizakhan has five children. The older children are old enough to help their parents with business. Azizakhan needs to loan in order to buy fruit to increase the selection of her goods.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Brice\u00f1o\r\n\r\nLaura began raising guinea pigs as a business 6 years ago.  It's comical to hear her say that as a child she didn't like these little critters but how they now help support the household.\r\n\r\nIt was on a cousin's birthday when she received 4 female guinea pigs so she could begin raising them; she had to purchase a male to begin reproduction.  The animals are fed alfalfa, fishmeal, and bran.  She invested her first loan in deworming medication which she applies twice a year.\r\n\r\nThe females turned out pregnant and the offspring are later sold after a few months, she even sometimes uses them to feed herself.

They work with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso so as to succeed in their agricultural activities during the rainy season. They are on their fifth loan with the institution.

reasons Makhsud is courteously requesting this loan. He is a very responsible and hard-working father who for many years has been dedicated to the business of buying and selling shoes. <P>\r\n\r\nMakhsud has so far accessed loans from IMON International five times and has seen his business expand. With the income, he said he was able to educate his children as that is the most important for Maksud. Today he is requesting a loan of 850 USD to expand the business so that he can generate more income in order to be able to arrange the wedding of his son. Maksud is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the other grains, from towns around Sikasso.\u00a0 Then she sells the grains retail to a customer base composed generally of consumers.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ass\u00e9tou envisions making a monthly profit of 275,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially for increasing her capital, taking part in meeting family expenses, paying the loan interest, and investing the rest in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":525535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ass\u00e9tou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779208},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961410},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699527},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913426},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180598},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476578},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613367},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751847},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606084},{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":41169.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917743}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T00:49:52Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":197806,"name":"Bose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bose is into the printing of documents and text books.

region of Upala in the Northern part of Costa Rica, minutes from the Nicaraguan border. Aristides is a dedicated father and producer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers in an effort to improve his living conditions. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities.  In addition to his agricultural activity, Aristides feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Aristides and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Aristides is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Aristides and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Aristides with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Aristides planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Aristides and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity for Aristides, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Aristides wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-16T03:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aristides","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":135.95,"local_amount":67972.9,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":69155.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158227},{"amount":264.05,"local_amount":132027.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:46Z","rounded_local_amount":134324.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614330}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T16:37:54Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242879,"name":"Elijah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elijah is 30 years old, married and blessed with two children.

She is married and has eight children, four of whom attend school and three of whom are presently working.  She earns her living by operating two business ventures: furniture making and ready-to-wear clothes businesses. Her husband, Rolando H., who is 50 years old, works in the furniture business to earn his living.  He also helps in his wife's business activities.  Medarda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Medarda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 30,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  For her 11th  loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy lumber for her furniture business so that she could continue to save up for the future and for her children's education.  Medarda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 27,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nFrancisca prays that her children will grow deeper in their relationship with the Lord.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from manufacturing and selling wood products to local businesses and community members.  Lu\u00e2n  has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lu\u00e2n  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lu\u00e2n  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.944..000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offerings.  Lu\u00e2n  is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional furniture products such as beds tables chairs.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

During spring and summer it is easy to sustain large farm animals, because there is no problem feeding the animals. However, the client does not have the money. This is why she plans to receive a loan, which will help her reach the goal. Besides, she would be able to sell this milk, thereby receiving additional income for her family. The client has 6 children and she needs to raise her income. Bibirikiya plans to pay off the loan within 12 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer<p>.<b>\r\n\u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430

Ismatilla is 42 years old and lives with his wife and four children, to whom he is a devoted father. He makes the most of every opportunity, such as when he started selling candies in the food market at Dushanbe. He gives his business constant attention all day long every day, and in this way he has attracted customers. His income enables him to contribute to the home finances. This is an activity Ismatilla enjoys because he can rest from his hard labor in the countryside. He is motivated in his work by the need to support the family finances and take care of his children's education in school. Ismatilla is requesting a loan with which he will invest in merchandise for his shop. He wishes to stock it with more products and offer the best products every day.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

All the members of the committee have developed independent occupations such as selling clothes, jewelry, ice cream, crafts etc.  All the members of the committee are mothers who participate with the end goal of strengthening their household economy.  They hope to develop their entrepreneurship in a sustainable way, with a vision of constant growth with the help of a permanent financial assistance.\r\n\r\nWe spoke with Mrs. Graciela Concepci\u00f3n M. C\u00e1ceres.  She is married with 2 children, a baby and a boy.  She is a teacher and works with the police.  She lives in a house in the central part of Barrio S. in the city of Villa Elisa.  Mrs. Graciela is a very active and multi-talented lady.  For the past 12 years, she has worked as a policewoman in the city of \u00d1emby and she made up the delegation that for years solicited the refurbishment of the infrastructure of the precinct.\r\n\r\nMrs. M. is the Deputy Major of the National Police.  She runs classes on the prevention of addictions.  These days she is in charge of a program to prevent addictions in the 7th precinct of \u00d1emby.  In addition, she acts as a teacher in the department of ethics and citizenship in various colleges in her community.  She also teaches a class on the prevention of addictions such as alcohol and drugs.  In 2008 and 2009, she worked to create a book aimed for the children and young people of her beloved city of \u00d1emby.\r\n\r\nHer efforts bore fruit and she published several samples with the help of local commissions and some colleges who used the material for their students.  In this way they learned of gambling, self-esteem, role models, family living, and above all to how to prevent drug use.  It is great teaching material and has been highly praised by her fellow police officers and by her fellow teachers. \r\n\r\nLast year, on the Day of the Police, she received a gold medal and a honorable mention for being the first woman police officer to publish a book.  The book titled \u201cI\u2019m Free\u201d is about the prevention of addictions.

It is comprised of 11 very hard-working and enthusiastic members.  They are completing their third cycle with the institution, and they have demonstrated themselves to be very responsible and honest members.\r\n\r\nGardenia has grown a lot with the previous loan, which she used for merchandise.  She now wishes to be able to expand her stall where she sells clothes.  To do so she needs a new loan, which will allow her to support her daughter.  She is not married, but she lives with her life partner.  He supports her in her projects.  She lives in her mother\u2019s house, but she wants to be able to be independent and have her own home some day.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members sell groceries, empanadas, clothes, or refreshments.  Some produce and sell bananas, sell food, sell cosmetics, have bakeries, or provide public transportation in \u201cmototaxis\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicles).\r\n\r\nThere is more competition in some businesses than others.  Most of the members of the group sell groceries.  They have a stall in the Mercado Campesino (country market).  Other members sell their products as street vendors.  They need to put forth a lot of effort to be able to get their daily income.  This income supports their families and is their chance to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy merchandise and supplies.  It is to improve their work tools, to repair their vehicles, and to remodel their houses.  They are in their third cycle in AgroCapital.  Their previous loans were passable.  In previous cycles some members did not make their payments.  The group had to change itself so that the members make their payments and are responsible.  Some members are new, but they have experience thanks to loans in other institutions that are similar to the Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":533426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gardenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irnalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guasase Roger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Timotea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1894.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1938.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1961.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1984.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2007.53},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2030.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2054.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2078.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2102.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2127.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2152.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":272.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.06},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285.61},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":288.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.72},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":299.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":201919,"name":"Americo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Americo forma parte del banco comunal \u201cLa Uni\u00f3n de Ollantaytambo\u201d, tiene 40 a\u00f1os y tiene cuatro hijos (dos varones  y dos mujeres), es natural de Quillbamba del distrito de Santa Teresa.

A. is a married woman who lives in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a pig fattening and a motorcycle business. Her husband, Vicente A., is 35 years old and works as a driver. They have four children aged 6 to 14 years. Veronica joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Veronica has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her to earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, thus raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP to buy more piglets so that she can continue to save for the future and send her children to school. Veronica A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They live together in the the village of Samugari, located in the tropical forests of Ayacucho. Here she has her own house, constructed with simple materials such as adobe and tin roofing. She comes from a family whose tradition is farming, and today she is quite an expert on farming.  \r\n\r\nFaced with the loss of her beloved husband, it was very difficult time for her to get through, as on her own she had to look ahead, and work for the sake of her dear daughter.  That's why she grows cacao, coffee, and trees for lumber. These products have provided her with the income necessary to maintain herself, and pay for her daughter's school expenses.\r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is planting her land, and she does it with great care. She has been doing this work for ten years and what she considers the hardest part is transporting her crops, since transport trucks are very scarce in that part of the region.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 17th loan with MFP. She is a very reliable member with regard to her previous payments, so she expects to continue in this way. With the 2,000 soles she is applying for, she will buy bags of natural and other fertilizers in order to improve her plants and obtain a good yield from her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":883326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy bags of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-04T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097787}],"funded_date":"2011-10-05T09:39:32Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":345364,"name":"Danize","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Danize is a 35-year-old married woman with nine children and she owns a house in Kasese, Uganda.
