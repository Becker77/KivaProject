She is 48 years old. Nenita is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Nenita owns and operates a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing new clothing to local community members. Nenita has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (about $83) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nenita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Nenita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Djamshed runs a caf\u00e9 cooking different kinds of meals. He is a 30-year-old man, married with four children. Being a very good and experienced cook, Djamshed has managed to make his business successful. The income from the business is used to improve the living conditions of his family. He also  dreams of being able to educate his children in the institutes and universities. \r\n<p>\r\nDjamshed is planning to make major renovations to the caf\u00e9 and to expand it to attract more new clients and keep the old ones. For this, he requests a loan of $2000 US. Djamshed thanks all for the support and promises to be precise in loan payments. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Tineimu has 6 years of experience in this business.  Tineimu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tineimu joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tineimu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tineimu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Their principle is to be creative and keep on trying.\r\n<p>\r\nSeyilbubu O. is the leader of this group. By the age of 52 she had raised 4 sons. Seyilbubu is divorced and she successfully overcame the ordeal of being a sole provider for the family as her eldest son is married already and started to help support his family. \r\n<p>\r\nAs to Seyilbubu\u2019s occupation, she offers seamstress\u2019s services. She makes handycrafts to order. She used to produce handycrafts for domestic use only. However, afterwards she started receiving orders from her acquaintances.\r\n<p>\r\nThis activity has allowed her to lead a relatively independent life. Her monthly income amounts to about 60 USD. She thriftily saved money and was able to send her kids to school and provide them with school supplies and clothes.\r\n<p>\r\nNow Seyilbubu dreams about buying new household appliances and a new sewing machine. Before doing that she needs to make new handycrafts for sale. She is in need of a loan to purchase a hundred kg of wadding and fabric.\r\n<p>\r\nSeyilbubu\u2019s partners are:\r\n<p> \r\nBermet M., 39, is a mother of three children. Her husband works in construction. Bermet breeds cattle. Two of her children go to school. Bermet needs a loan to buy a cow. Bermet\u2019s dream is to provide her children with education.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnaz B., 34, has three children. Her eldest son, in spite of being just sixteen, already earns his own living. The other two children go to school. Gulnaz is a seamstress. She needs a loan to purchase fabric.\r\n<p>\r\nAinura E. K., 41, breeds cattle and sells milk. Her husband is a policeman. He works in a crime detection department. In his free time he helps his wife look after the cattle.

She lives in her mother's house together with her husband Atis (33). They have 3 small children. Jenny works planting potatoes, maize, peas and gladioli flowers, which are some of the best in the zone thanks to painstaking dedication she gives to them. What Jenny likes most about her work is planting the gladioli seeds and enjoying their exquisite smell. Nevertheless, she gets annoyed sometimes because her plots are so far away from her house. On top of her agricultural work she also raises 16 cows, which she has at the top of the village where she lives. Jenny's husband works as a driller in a mine in the south of Peru and comes home every 20 days. In the future Jenny is planning to continue to plant seeds, and for this wants to purchase more plots of productive land in her area. She also wants to build a house in the central city zone to install a food-sale business. This is the second time Jenny has had a loan from MFP and she is happy to work with the other members of her communal bank, as it has proved to be a good group, with Jenny presiding on the board of directors. All the members actively work to pay their repayments punctually. Jenny plans to invest this loan in the purchase of various sacks of fertiliser which she will scatter over her pea, maize and potato crops. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":566477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertiliser to improve crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724884}],"funded_date":"2010-07-14T08:06:59Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":217933,"name":"Mar\u00eda Del Pilar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda del Pilar es una madre de familia de 38 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposo y a sus tres hijos en el sector el Huabal, un centro poblado perteneciente al distrito de Chep\u00e9n, una zona agr\u00edcola de movimiento comercial moderado, pertenece a la provincia del mismo nombre y se encuentra ubicada en la Regi\u00f3n La Libertad, a una hora y cuarenta y cinco minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica a trabajar en actividades relacionadas con la agricultura, ella cuenta con un terreno de cultivo en donde suele sembrar diversos granos y cereales, como ma\u00edz y arroz, su familia depende de esta actividad para mantener gran parte de su econom\u00eda, por lo que siempre cuida de sus cultivos para que estos puedan brindarle una excelente producci\u00f3n.\n\nEn esta oportunidad ella ha sembrado ma\u00edz en su terreno, Mar\u00eda desea brindarle mantenimiento aplic\u00e1ndole algunos fertilizantes, por ello ha cre\u00eddo conveniente solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que le permitan realizar esta acci\u00f3n.\n\nMar\u00eda del Pilar siempre se esfuerza al m\u00e1ximo para sacar adelante a su familia.

Su necesidad de financiamiento est\u00e1 basada en que son pocos muy pocos los hospedajes que hay en el pueblo y esto  genera que   permanezcan colmados y con el cupo completo y los potenciales hu\u00e9spedes pasen mucho trabajo al llegar al municipio. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual Javier acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual  acondicionar\u00e1 habitaciones para aumentar el servicio, adecuar\u00e1 cuartos de ba\u00f1o, pintar\u00e1 y  embaldosar\u00e1 estas habitaciones. Su inversi\u00f3n es exitosa porque la hace con base en una necesidad de su creciente clientela, en la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o, \u00e9poca en la cual se incrementan el paso de los conductores de carga pesada, por San Jacinto,  as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n los turistas visitantes y Javier no se quiere quedar atr\u00e1s con el desarrollo tur\u00edstico de su regi\u00f3n..  ","en":"Javier, 42, is a married man with two children, 15 and 18. He lives in the town of San Jacinto in the department of Bol\u00edvar, a land of traditional vertical-woven  handicrafts, shoulder bags, and hammocks made by the women, who have passed the trade down from generation to generation. Javier has an inn where travelers with heavy loads can avail themselves of the opportunity to rest before continuing along Colombia's roadways. In this town, where there are very few inns and truckers often need to stay where their vehicles are parked, Javier has a very special relative who is the primary promoter of Javier's line of business; he looks after the trucks in the lots, and recommends people to the inn. \r\n\r\nJavier needs financing because there are so few inns in town that they're always full, so it's a big problem when potential guests come to town. He's seeking a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo so he can air-condition the rooms for better service, and paint and tile the bathrooms to bring them up to snuff. The investment will be a success because he's doing it in response to his clientele's growing need during the end of the year, when more heavy-load truckers are passing through San Jacinto.  The are also tourists and Javier doesn't want to miss out on the developing tourism industry in his region.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They both work to support the family. She has seven children between the ages of 17 and 2 years old. \r\n\r\nSarah is a resident of Kipsirichet centre, 3 km from Londiani Town, Kericho district served by the Kadet Koibatek office.

Nora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 to use as additional capital for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Nora is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He is a simple and hardworking man and lives in his own house with his wife, Cielito. They have been married for 16 years. They have two wonderful children. \r\n\r\nRedentor has been engaged in growing rice for 10 years and puts into practice everything he learned from his parents. He plants twice a year. The first period is during the rainy season, when crops grow without having to be watered, and the second is in the watering season, when they grow with the help of irrigation.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his work is taking care of his produce, because he feels like he has done a good job each harvest time when he goes to the wholesale market in town. He also has a cow that he uses to plow the fields. He plows for his own farm and for others' also who pay him extra money, around 150 Philippine pesos (PHP) per day. He is now preparing to plant the rice, and he is hoping for a good harvest.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to one of the leading microfinance institutions in the Philippines, Alalay Sa Kaunlaran Inc. (ASKI), where he counts on the help of the lenders to assist him in his business. He is committed to paying back the loan on time. Redentor is requesting a loan of 17,000 PHP. The loan will be used to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer to begin planting his rice.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Redentor dreams of having a small store to earn extra income for his family, to be able to meet all their needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":811783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer, such as manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cabisera 5, Ilagan, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-07-15T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Redentor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T08:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":17112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244816238}],"funded_date":"2011-07-15T18:35:52Z","paid_date":"2011-12-17T08:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aya Padr\u00f3n","image":275073}},{"id":320398,"name":"Bakari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bakari is a married man with eleven children; four children attend school while seven have graduated from school.

Mr. T. is much sought after by his clientele due to the quality of his products. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to satisfy his ever growing clientele, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about one year ago. He is on his second individual loan after having reimbursed the preceding one without difficulty. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, he intends to buy 30 cell phones of various brands, 3 boxes of covers, 10 chargers, 20 packets of memory cards, 5 big clocks, 6 cartons of batteries, 4 dozen speakers, etc. He buys his merchandise in Bamako and resells his wares to a clientele composed generally of young people and especially itinerant merchants who come to the weekly fairs every Saturday and Sunday. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 200,000 F CFA which will be used essentially to add to his working capital, contribute to covering family expenses, and pay the interest on the loan, investing any remainder back into his business.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":363969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchasing cell phones, accessories and watches for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":366.67,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":166896.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112744},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83448.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028313},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83448.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873641},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83448.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763353},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":83448.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152170}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T13:24:02Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":131087,"name":"Immaculate's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

P. is 27 and married with 3 children (ages 1 - 5years).

Asufaaniutu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 25 tala or US $10 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Asufaaniutu joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Asufaaniutu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Asufaaniutu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nMore about IMON International\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

R. is a 40 year old man who lives with his wife and 4 children in a community called  La Palma de Puerto Jim\u00e9nez in the province of Puntarenas. For many years his town has worked in goldmining and lumber until the national park Corcovado was created. Together with its beautiful beaches, they have opened up the tourist industry and today it is the most important one of the region.  \r\n\r\nHayder spent his whole life in the lumber industry until the regulations from the establishment of the national park put a stop to the cutting of trees in the forests of Puerto Jim\u00e9nez. Thanks to the experience he had from his work, his good attitude and the wish to keep getting ahead, he obtained  a post in the Department of Protection of Natural Resources of the Corcovado National Park.  HIs job now is to protect the forest that his family damaged for years. \r\n\r\nHis good performance at work allowed him to win a scholarship so that he could finishe his secondary education and obtain an administrative position in the same are in which he already works. That is why Hayder is asking for a loan of  \u00a2500 000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy a computer, which he needs urgently for his studies. He will also use it to rent out during the day to tourists in the area. \r\n\r\nMr. Hayder S. R. is a member of Ra\u00edces Capitales S.A, one of 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his second loan and with it he hopes to continue growing personally and financially. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

She is a mother of four children, the oldest of whom is 19 years old. For six years, since the start-up of her business, Sairan and her children have worked hard for the major part of the daytime. The family buys young calves, breeds them and resells them at a higher price. Sairan says that the hardest part is covering all the costs related to feeding and providing healthy conditions for cattle breeding. Approximately every month, Sairan takes a head of cattle for sale to a local market. A couple of years ago she increased her stock from three heads to ten heads. The initial capital of 4,000 KGS was returned in a month of operating the business. Sairan believes in a bright future for her business, therefore decided to broaden her stock by applying for a loan from Kiva. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

This is where, 26 years ago, she established her family with her husband, Herminio.  They have five children who they take care off and protect in their own house.\r\n\r\nHer main financial activity is farming.  When she was a young girl she was taught how to work the land, how to make it productive, and how to live from it.  That is why 25 years ago she started to grow coffee on her five hectares of land and bananas on the next six hectares.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most is growing bananas.  She likes it because every two weeks she harvests the mature fruit, thereby obtaining steady income.  What she likes the least is the time when the prices are not stable in the market.  \r\n\r\nHowever, this does not discourage her because she receives continuous training from the cooperative where she sells her coffee crops.  She continually travels to the city of Huancayo to sell her banana crops.\r\n\r\nShe is skilled in  business, and a short time ago she opened a grocery store.  She sells basic needs products, and she gets good earnings.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the El Palomar al \u00c9xito Communal Bank.  This is her fourth loan with MFP.  She hopes to receive your contribution in order to continue on with her objectives.  She pledges, once again, to make her payments as she has done with her previous loans.  \r\n\r\nAlso, it pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.

Rosario Nahuala Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ten minutes before the \u201dRosario Nahuala\u201d embroidery group begins, one can see groups of women, in typical dress, running through the streets of Nahuala shouting the names of their friends in the native Quiche language.  What is happening is that the members of the group are looking for their friends who are not present in the Friendship Bridge office for the payment.  Until all the clients of the communal bank are present, the loan cannot be repaid.  For many of the clients, the repayment of the loan is one of the most important events of the month.\r\n<p>\r\nThe meeting begins five minutes late, but with all members of the group in the office.  Many are a little anxious but happy to receive their first loan.  Others reflect the shyness typical of new clients.  This shyness will fade away in time, as the group consolidates and they all receive training about self-esteem and women\u2019s rights, among other themes of interest.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll the clients work in the textile industry. The majority work in traditional fabrics. Meanwhile others embroider flowers and birds in the typical blouses of the region. Finally, the rest of the group buys and sells clothes and traditional dress.  They are going to use the loan to buy the thread and clothes of their respective resale.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is believed that once the clients start to receive a loan their opportunities and dreams will begin to flourish.  The women would like to learn about administration of their business.  By luck, Friendship Bridge offers training in the themes in which the clients have interest.  This basic training helps the women very much, especially those who are new to microfinance.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSurprisingly, the common dream among everyone is that their respective business can grow so that they can support and send their children to school. It is in our hands to support these women with their noble goals.  Few people spend so much effort for the benefit of others.  It is an admirable characteristic that people worldwide should imitate, and with our help these women can realize their dreams.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Katrina H, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Diez minutos antes de empezar la reuni\u00f3n de desembolso del grupo \u201cel Rosario Nahuala\u201d uno pod\u00eda ver grupos de se\u00f1oras, en sus trajes t\u00edpicos, corriendo por las calles de Nahuala gritando los nombres de sus compa\u00f1eras en el idioma Quich\u00e9. Lo que pasaba era que las integrantes del grupo estaban buscando a sus compa\u00f1eras que no estaban presentes en la oficina de Friendship Bridge para el desembolso, y hasta que no est\u00e9n todas las clientas del banco comunal el pr\u00e9stamo no se puede desembolsar. Para muchas de las clientas el desembolso del pr\u00e9stamo es uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s importantes del mes. \r\n\r\n<P>La reuni\u00f3n empez\u00f3 cinco minutos tarde, pero ya con todas las integrantes del grupo en la oficina. Muchas de ellas estaban un poco ansiosas pero felices por \u00a1recibir su primer pr\u00e9stamo! Otras, reflejaban aquella timidez t\u00edpica de clientes nuevas. Esa timidez se va borrando a trav\u00e9s del tiempo conforme el grupo se vaya consolidando y ellas vayan a recibiendo capacitaciones sobre autoestima y derechos de la mujer entre otros temas de su inter\u00e9s. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las clientas trabajan en la industria textil. La mayor\u00eda trabaja en tejidos tradicionales. Mientras que otras bordan flores y aves en las blusas t\u00edpicas de la regi\u00f3n. Finalmente, el resto del grupo compra y vende ropa y trajes tradicionales. Ellas van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de hilo y ropa para su respectiva reventa.\r\n\r\n<P>Se cree que una vez las clientas empiezan a recibir pr\u00e9stamos sus horizontes y sue\u00f1os empiezan a agrandarse. A las se\u00f1oras les gustar\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s sobre administraci\u00f3n de sus negocios y medicinas. Por suerte, Friendship Bridge ofrece capacitaciones en los temas que las clientas est\u00e1n interesadas. Este tipo de capacitaciones b\u00e1sica ayuda mucho a las mujeres, especialmente a las que reci\u00e9n empiezan en las microfinanzas.\r\n\r\n<P>Sorprendentemente, el sue\u00f1o com\u00fan de todas es que su respectivo negocio pueda crecer para que as\u00ed puedan alimentar y mandar a sus hijos al colegio. Est\u00e1 en nuestras manos apoyar a estas se\u00f1oras con sus nobles metas. Pocas personas avocan todos sus esfuerzos para el beneficios de otros.

from Tanzania! Latifa R. was born thirty-five years ago; she's married with two children, ages 10 and 16. In 2005, Latifa established her poultry business (kuku) which enables her to earn a monthly profit of 500 USD. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Who or what are \"kuku,\" you may ask. Kuku means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. They require little start-up capital: you can start with two and wait for them to multiply naturally! They also require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Latifa is requesting the loan of 875 USD in order to purchase 400 chicks and additional feed. In the future, Latifa plans to buy even more chicks and expand her business further!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":192703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional chicks and feed for her poultry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T17:50:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Latifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:21:27Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101904,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356221},{"amount":87,"local_amount":99428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100746,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347974},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970548},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886765},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436025},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130298},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027129},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613169},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010252},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232563}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:21:27Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65537,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aida N. est une femme ag\u00e9e de 59 ans .elle est mari\u00e9e et habite au quartier Cit\u00e9 Lamy de thi\u00e8s .elle fait du commerce de denr\u00e9es alimentaires  et quelque fois des tissus depuis vingt ans elle sollicite ce pret pour le renforcement de ses activit\u00e9s.","en":"Aida N., 59, is married and lives in the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood in Thi\u00e8s.

She lives with her husband and children in the Missira neighborhod of the town of  S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). <P>\r\n\r\nNever having attended school because of socio-economic reasons, she had very religious parents who saw the \"white man's school\" as the road to perdition. Since she was very young, she busied herself with petty trading, working with her mother who sold rice. Rich in experience gained at her mother's side, she decided after her marriage to go out on her own and has been in business for 20 years, selling various items (thermos bottles, prepaid phone cards, dishes, shoes, portable phones, etc.) and has a very good reputation. <P>\r\n\r\nIt is with the intention of increasing her working capital that she joined Soro Yiriwaso, 30 months ago. After 1 individual loan and 3 solidarity loans, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan which will be used to buy 50 thermos bottles, 10 pairs of shoes, 3 dozen bowls, 10 portable phones, and a carton of prepaid phone cards from \"Orange\" cell telephone server. She buys her telephones and rechargeable cards in Bamako; her thermos bottles, bowls and shoes come from Ghana. She sells for cash and credit, out of her home and door-to-door, to a clientele composed primarily of men. She expects to make an average monthly profit of 70,000 F CFA which will be used to add to her savings, buy some animals little by little, and reimburse the loan. <P>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to save as much as possible so as to build a house to live in. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a hard-working person, which he demonstrates each and every day as he carries out the arduous tasks of living in the countryside. Abdufatto has been a farmer from the start, having inherited his lands \u2013 and the occupation \u2013 from his parents. With the passing of time, he has also implemented raising livestock into his enterprise. Each day, he takes his cows to graze in the far reaches of his fields. With these activities, he earns income to support the living expenses of his family. Abdufatto is learning every day how to run his business to the best end result. He seeks a loan for working capital, specifically so he can buy cattle, considering that the prices for them are low now. Abdufatto deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes: its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is forty-eight years old. Cecilia is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Cecilia owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing party services to local community members. Cecilia earns approximately 500 PHP daily for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cecilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cecilia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third loan Cecilia has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has a one year old daughter, who her mother helps care for.  Her husband works as a collector for the Caf\u00e9 Soluble plant.  She works as a teller in a bank.  She has been doing this for one year, but her salary is low.  She also works with the new businesses in the capital city on the weekends, where she can earn a little extra, but this limits the time she is able to spend with her family.  She also gets off of work very late and she is often afraid when traveling home, because of the crime along her route.\r\n\r\nHer plans are to move into another position that will provide better income, which will allow her to complete the improvements to her small home, which she and her husband have managed to build.

This parish produces large quantities of milk since the majority of the population works in agriculture and raising cattle. Much of the population has emigrated to various places around the world in search of a better quality of life for their families. \r\n\r\nOur partner is 40 years old, married with 3 children ages 20, 18 and 6. Her two older children work and help economically while her husband can't find steady work, but does so when he is hired as a master bricklayer. Their joint efforts have allowed them to build their own home. Maria takes care of the daily household chores as well as raising chickens, guinea pigs, pigs and cattle which she sells when the need arises. \r\n\r\nShe has been our partner through two cycles and is very happy with her friends in the group. Her new loan will be invested in the purchase of fertilizer for the grazing field so she can feed her cattle properly since her goal is to keep growing the business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":566586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lastenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632991},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847025},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113481},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407131},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407132},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388214},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388215},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682772}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T22:20:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":217981,"name":"Yuliya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yuliya is married.

With the economic downturn and being on a fixed income, she saw the need to have a business. She made this decision two years ago, to sell cosmetics and lingerie to people she knows. Since then, she has been selling to more customers, working with them in their homes, selling to them on credit. She always maintains order in her business; she attempts to record all the products she sells and the pending credit that each customer has. She has now set goals for the future since her business has brought in good revenue. In the future she would like to have more merchandise and more customers.

She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nElvira operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Elvira earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located inside her house. At the same time, she earns additional income by sewing or repairing clothes and pants. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Ahmatillo has been in touch with the countryside. His family dedicated themselves to cultivating fruits and vegetables and he imagined he\u2019d be in the business of selling produce. Fortunately, he has realized this dream. At the age of 22, he began to sell fruit and vegetables in small markets. Little by little, he saved money so he could set up his own shop. Thanks to his efforts and the love he has for this business, Ahmatillo\u2019s enterprise has been growing gradually. Nevertheless, Ahmatillo believes it is time to inject more capital into the business so that he can buy at the wholesale level and obtain better prices. As a result, he is applying for a loan of 3500 Somoni, which he will repay in 9 months. With your help, Ahmatillo will be able to move his business forward and offer his wife and two children a better future.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zafar is a 42-year-old farmer who lives with his family, consisting of two children and his wife (pictured). He has two milk cows and sells dairy products to the local and capital traders. Zafar has 6 years of experience in raising cattle and selling dairy products. The milk products are in very high demand in his village. Zafar\u2019s orders for these products are very high but the milk his cows give is not enough for traders and he decided to apply for 800 USD to purchase an additional cow and fodder. Zafar is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living with this loan. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ruth has been farming for 29 years now, selling her milk and staple goods to the Kenya Cooperative Creameries and local market respectively. She also runs a kiosk and posho mill in the same building. The two businesses have enabled her to earn a living and meet her family's expenses. \r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Ksh 25,000 to improve her poultry project.

She is married and the mother of one son who is 19 years old and attends school.  She completed school through the 10th grade but could not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her family and supports 2 stepchildren who live with her.  \r\n\r\nShe left Inhambane for Boane when her father was transferred for work when she was just 2 years old.  She has been working as a maid for over 2 years and has a monthly salary of 1.300.00mt which she uses for household expenses.  With the help of her husband who is a stonemason, she is able to save a bit of money through xitique (a traditional rotational savings plan). \r\n\r\nShe has never had a loan with other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are clients of this institution.  This is her 4th loan, in the amount of 11.000.00mt, which she will use to purchase construction material (cement, sand, stones, etc.) to continue building her home.  Her previous loans were for 5.000.00mt, 5.800.00mt, 6.000.00mt for housing and business. She promises to pay back this loan on schedule in order to have access to additional loans.  In the future she plans to request more loans to complete construction.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

de comidas y la contrat\u00f3. Luego de unos meses la hija de Alida le coment\u00f3 que en vez de trabajar para otros deb\u00eda trabajar lo suyo de manera propia. Entonces Alida un dia sintonizando la radio escuch\u00f3 la publicidad de FAMA y se aboc\u00f3 a las oficinas a solicitar un prestamo, el cual unos dia despues le fue otorgado por Lps. 2,000 y solamente con ese poco de dinero comenz\u00f3 con una venta de golosinas. Actualmente su negocio a crecido y ahora es un comedor y se llama Comedor Ingrid, trabaja sola, y su horario laboral inicia desde las 6:00 am y culmina las 4:00 pm y tiene una muy buena clientela. Su meta es llegar a tener un local propio ya que donde tiene instalado su comedor es alquilado y el costo es alto. Ademas sue\u00f1a en que poco a poco su peque\u00f1o comedor se ira convirtiendo en un restaurante de comida buffet.\n\nEl prestamo que Alida solicita lo necesita para comprar refrescos, agua, jugos, verduras, salsas, carnes, pastas, pollo, embutidos, frijoles, arroz, platano, azucar, cafe, lacteos, entre otros productos necesarios para la elaboracion de las comidas. Alida confia que con el apoyo de este financiamiento pueda comprar todo lo necesario para surtir su negocio y mantenerlo activo, y que pueda obtener ganancias para cubrir los gastos mas necesarios de sus hijos y hogar.\n\nAlida tiene mas de 5 a\u00f1os de trabajar con los prestamos de FAMA y siempre ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente, y con tambien ha podido ampliar su negocio y ha mejorado su vivienda.\n\n \n\n","en":"Alida is 44 years old, and works selling food and drink.  She is married with one daughter and three sons, and lives in La Colonia Trochez in the municipality of Juticalpa. \r\n\r\nAlida learned this trade eight years ago, thanks to one of her friends who had a food stand and hired her.  Several months later Alida's daughter suggested to her that instead of working for other people, she should work for herself.  So one day Alida was tuning the radio and heard the advertisement for FAMA, and she took herself to the offices to request a loan.  Some days later, they offered her Lps.2,000, and with only this small amount of money, she started selling candy. \r\n\r\nToday, her business has grown and now she has a diner called \"Comedor Ingrid\".  She works on her own; her works schedule starts at 6 a.m. and goes till 4 p.m., and she has a very good customer base.

He is a very hard working young man who lives in his own home with his dear, 5-year old son, Dayron.  He instills in his son the importance of education.  Even at his young age, Erick is focused on his responsibilities and obligations.  Life has given him obstacles, but he is undaunted.  Today he tries to excel at growing cacao, coffee and citrus fruits.  After harvesting his plants, he brings them to the city of San Francisco to sell.  In San Fransisco, he has various purchasers who are familiar with the quality of his products and are always sure to wait for him to purchase his whole crop.  What Erick likes most about his work is planting his fields and making them fertile and productive.  He has been in this line of work for 6 years and feels that the most difficult part is spraying his parcels of land, which is something he must do very carefully so that the chemicals don't damage his health.  In the future, he hopes to keep saving his earnings so he can purchase additional land.  This is Erick's second loan with MFP, and he hopes each one of you can help him, as he knows the money he will be loaned will be very beneficial in the progress of his labor.  He is happy to a part of the group of members that make up his communal bank.  With the requested money, Erick will contract day laborers to help him maintain his crops: pruning, clearing and spraying.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":872514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to contract day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":213.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":218.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":229.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":235.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":243.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":255.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":261.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":272.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":280.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":288.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.97},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.14,"local_amount":213.88,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":216.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666546},{"amount":80.91,"local_amount":218.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":220.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621695},{"amount":84.79,"local_amount":229.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":231.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835777},{"amount":86.97,"local_amount":235.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":237.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245536},{"amount":90.14,"local_amount":243.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":246.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385588},{"amount":94.63,"local_amount":255.76,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":258.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098660},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":261.84,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":264.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712882},{"amount":100.8,"local_amount":272.41,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":275.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201985},{"amount":103.84,"local_amount":280.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":283.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097775},{"amount":106.9,"local_amount":288.91,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":291.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400657}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T02:18:28Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":340953,"name":"Trinidad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trinidad, a 39-year-old married mother of four school-aged children, lives in the village of Katipunan in Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

When she first joined TYM, she just borrowed 50 USD because she wanted to get used to the weekly repayments policy.  The profit she earned after the first year was not a whole lot, yet it helped her gain more confidence for the next loans.  With Ms. N.'s cleverness, there is a significant increase in her family income.  The loan is used more efficiently.  Each month she earns about 100 USD from making sedge mats.  With the savings from many years, she is able to build a new house.  Ms. N. is very happy because TYM Fund helps her have a better life and her children are able to go to school.  Now Ms. N. is thinking about breeding fish.  Since the cost of food is increasing, she needs more money to buy good food for her fish.  Thus, she would like to borrow 375 USD to buy breeding fish and fishfood.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec7t, 37 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean n\u0103m th\u1ee9 4 c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Umedullo is a young clothing merchant from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He started his small business when he was in his late 20\u2019s and gradually, though much hard work, has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. Umedullo has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man.\r\n\r\nFunding from IMON International has been instrumental in helping Umedullo build his business. His first loan was for $600 and since that time he has benefited from one additional loan while establishing a great credit history.\r\n\r\nHe has now requested a loan of 6200 Somoni to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Umedullo. He would like to buy a supply of women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing that will boost his inventory before the busy summer season.\r\n\r\nUmedullo appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family.  \r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 35; married; and the mother of 3 children who are 17, 14, and 10.  All of them go to school.  She studied only through the 7th grade and stopped due to an untimely pregnancy.  She lives in her own home with her family in neighborhood 5 in Boane.  She doesn't support anyone besides her family.  She left for Matola for Boane in 2008 with her family and built her home in Boane.  She has had her own business for 2 years and buys and sells chickens.  She buys chicks for 19 meticais and sells the chickens for 95 meticais.  She has 2 workers, and she works from 9 am.-2 p.m.  Her monthly income is around 5,000 meticais, with which she supports her family and saves some via a tradtional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her neighbors.  This is her first loan and it is for 11,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy chicks and feed to increase her quantity of chickens and respond to the demand for her product during the holiday season that is approaching.  She promises to pay back this credit on time so she will be able to receive more loans.  In the future, she hopes to buy vehicle that will help her transport her merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":433106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To raise chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T02:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":551.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.9},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":583.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":599.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":617.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":635.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":653.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":672.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":691.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":711.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":731.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":752.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":774.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":796.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":819.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":843.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":1278.49,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709073},{"amount":89.25,"local_amount":2454.3,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2614.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938192},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":1312.21,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1397.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938193},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":1322.61,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1408.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":128972059},{"amount":100.65,"local_amount":2767.98,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-25T07:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2948.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916086},{"amount":64.06,"local_amount":1864.41,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.74,"payment_id":159878513}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T03:55:37Z","paid_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":160026,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cJes\u00fas de Nazaret\u201d, en el distrito de Ilave, provincia de El Collao, departamento de Puno.
