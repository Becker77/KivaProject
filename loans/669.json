Con el apoyo de este financiamiento ella podra surtir su negocio de ropa y de sandalias de diferentes colores y estilos para satisfacer a sus clientes. \n\nMuy contenta Kenia expreso que con los prestamos obtenidos en FAMA a podido ir mejorando su casa y tambien pudo comprar su refrigeradora y eso le ha a ayudado a ahorrar algunos centavos porque antes se le arruinaban algunos productos que necesitaban refrigeracion.\n\nSu meta es seguir apoyando a sus hijos para que culminen sus estudios academicos y su sue\u00f1o es culminar las mejoras de su casa. Kenia tiene mas de dieciseis ciclos en FAMA y ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente.\n\n","en":"The 'Unidas para Vencer' community bank has ten members who are engaged in different business activities in the village of San Nicolas, in Juticalpa.  The bank's coordinator is Kenia Jacqueline and she sells second-hand clothes and sandals.  She is 33 years old, married, and has three sons.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, following the example of one of her neighbors, Kenia decided to start selling second-hand clothes and bought her first bundle of clothes with the financial support of her husband.  Although it wasn't a lot, it was enough to get her started.  Her business doesn't have a name because she makes her sales as an itinerant vendor.  She also sometimes makes sales from her home when her neighbors or friends come to find her.  The biggest difficulty that Kenia faces is the rainy season because it means she can't go out and she loses sales.  She also has problems when she sells merchandise on credit because sometimes her customers take a long time to pay her back.\r\n\r\nKenia needs the loan that she is requesting to buy a bundle of second-hand clothes and also to buy sandals so that she can do something a little different with her business.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to stock her business with clothes and sandales in different colors and styles in order to satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\nKenia commented very happily that, as a result of the loans she has received from FAMA, she has been able to continue improving her home and has also been able to buy a refrigerator.  This has helped her to save a few cents because, before she bought the refrigerator, some products that needed refrigerating used to go off.\r\n\r\nKenia's goal is to continue supporting her children so that they finish their education.  Her dream is to finish carrying out improvements to her home.  Kenia has been working with FAMA for more than 16 loan cycles and she has made her repayments punctually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":864529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy bundles of second-hand clothes and sandals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenia Jacquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leda Suyapa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gesi Elminta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Ondina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ada Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784962},{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589359},{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547454},{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758092}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T13:21:16Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":337631,"name":"Evangeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evangeline is 61 years old and married.

Since the time is approaching when she is asked for graduation gowns, caps, and men's suits she needs fine quality fabric to satisfy her customers.

He is known for his honesty and compassion, extending credit to families that would otherwise go hungry between paydays.  With this loan he plans to increase his inventory and provide a working capital cushion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Roma, commonly known as gypsies, is a severely marginalized social group in Bulgaria and throughout the Balkans.<\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital (inventory)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BG","country":"Bulgaria","town":"Sliven","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42.685833 26.329167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":3,"posted_date":"2006-09-06T22:39:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Portocal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-09-26T21:38:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2006-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2006-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2006-12-07T17:39:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2900},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2007-02-12T13:36:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7364},{"amount":304,"local_amount":304,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T02:01:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":304,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10690},{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T11:26:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23292},{"amount":141,"local_amount":141,"processed_date":"2007-07-30T12:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37101},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T10:44:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71082},{"amount":211,"local_amount":211,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T13:03:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":211,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87109},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T12:49:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106707},{"amount":12,"local_amount":12,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T07:17:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279244}],"funded_date":"2006-09-12T21:38:09Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T07:17:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":4897,"name":"Elnur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elnur H. is an Internally-Displaced Person (IDP) from the Lachin region of Azerbaijan.

She later married and started a family. Due to the need to stay at home to care for her children, she got the idea of starting up the business she currently has. Things have gone well for her, since she is the only person in the neighborhood who sells these products. She has always noticed the unmet needs of consumers and realized that there was no good place for visitors to stay in Mache, so she opened a small hostel. <p>She is one of the founding members of the \u201cMujeres con Futuro\u201d (Women with a Future) communal bank, which she joined 5 years ago. The first loan she received was for S\/. 300.00 and she used the money to start her agriculture\/veterinary supply store. <p>With this loan of S\/. 2000.00, which she will repay in 4 months, she will buy 1 box of Hieloxil, a product that is used to cure infections of potato plants and which is very much in demand during this season; 1 box of Tif\u00f3n, which is for killing weevils; and 1 box of Extrafox. <p>Santos dreams of having another business location, which she would make into a large and modern hardware store. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>La se\u00f1ora Santos Evelia Rodr\u00edguez A. tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  Feeds and Rice Retailer and an Egg and Balut(fertilized duck eggs) supplier businesses. Her husband Joel, who is 41 years old, works as a retailer to earn his living.  They have 3 children who are between 4 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,900 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing  24,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more addtional capital for stocks of rice and feeds to resell so that she could continue to save up for the future to have an additional business (a grocery). \r\n\r\nGina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

L. C. is just 25 years old and already owns a snack bar called \u201cEstadero DonD. Nataly.\u201d  She lives with her spouse and two children, who are 3 and 6 years old, in the Pastrana neighborhood of Puerto Colombia, very near the ocean.\r\n\r\nShe started the business a year ago when she acquired the locale and started a family-oriented snack bar.  She sells all kinds of refreshments and cold beverages maD. more appetizing by good Caribbean music.  \r\n\r\nNataly started her entrepreneurial activity in order to contribute to family income because her husband works as a mototaxi driver in this municipality where this type of transportation is the norm.\r\n\r\nThe business has been very well received and her customer base is growing, especially on weekends which is when families go out to have fun and enjoy being near the ocean.  Besides, they enjoy a pleasant atmosphere at \u201cEstadero DonD. Nataly.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is Nataly\u2019s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to use it to buy beverages and refreshments avoiding buying them from middlemen who sell them at higher prices.  By buying direct, she will save $105,000 COP a month compared to what she spends when she buys from middlemen.  She buys 30 cases of beverages per week and each case she buys from them has a $3,500 COP surcharge so she earns little or no profits from them that way.\r\n\r\nHer dream for the future is to improve the locale\u2019s conditions thereby providing better service.  Her greatest challenge is competition because there are similar locations that are more comfortable.  However, Nataly\u2019s answer to her shortcoming is to proviD. excellent, personalized customer service.  This is why she has regular customers that recognize this quality of hers and prefer to spend a pleasant time with their families in her less flashy establishment.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":608532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tourism","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":" To buy beverages at wholesale in order to avoid purchasing from middlemen who sell at higher prices.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nataly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":81414,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550756},{"amount":90,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":162827.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427585},{"amount":90,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":162828,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289011},{"amount":45,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":81414,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509045},{"amount":90,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":162828,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319837},{"amount":90,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-19T08:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":162827.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568964}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T23:43:00Z","paid_date":"2011-12-19T08:53:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":239284,"name":"Wina Lyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wina Lyn B. is from the village of Del Pilar, Baliangao.

Maribel's husband also works hard and both of them make every effort on a daily basis to improve their economic situation and to give their son the best education.  Maribel and her family live with her father-in-law and they all get along well.\r\n\r\nMaribel has set up a grocery store at home where she sells fruit, vegetables, groceries, sweets and cookies.  She works at this business during the week.  And on the weekends she sets up a stall at the San Felipe del Progreso market where she sells women's stockings and men's socks in different textures and colors.  She also sells women's underwear.  Maribel says that these are difficult times but she does all she can to earn a living.  She says her husband works hard and gives her a lot of support and this makes her even more enthusiastic because otherwise things would be too difficult.\r\n\r\nShe says that sales from her stall have good days and bad, but she says business is like that.  The hardest part is setting up and taking down the stall.  She leaves the house in San Agustin at 5:00 a.m. in order to reach San Felipe by 5:30 a.m. and start setting up.  At 7:00 a.m.people start buying at the stall.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Maribel's goal is not to owe money for the goods she buys.  She is requesting a loan now but is determined to pay it back with hard work.

She can weave and then embroider four of them in a 15-day period, and then she sells them in the market in Chimaltenango for about US$70 each.  This will be her second loan with Friendship Bridge, and she says that having the capital lets her make just a little progress on the economic front, making just a little more profit, since she doesn't have to struggle so to save up to purchase the yarn.\r\n<p>\r\nPaulina's group, the \"Flor de Pascua\", or \"Easter Flower\" group, takes their loan commitment very seriously. They receive their loans as a group and are jointly accountable for them. They're very proud of their repayment record. \r\n<p>\r\nPaulina, like several other women in her village, reports that the children under age 2 are very regularly sick, with fevers, headaches, and stomach aches.

Their aim is to expand her business so that Maria's customers are satisfied and their dreams are to construct a house in order to leave a place to live to their children as it's very important to her husband that they all live together as a family.  Her husband has already taught the children many important lessons on how to be good men and women serving society.  Their wish is to improve their family's quality of life, as they have only managed so far with their business to secure stability through the payment of certain debts.  A further desire is to travel abroad as there she would be able to work and send back money to her sons to cover all the necessary expenses.  \r\n\r\nMaria's economic activity is to run a grocery store in which she offers good such as:  basic grains, sweets, natural juices and bread.  Her business is located in her home, and she has run her business for 6 years.  Mar\u00eda began her business because she possessed some of her own funds and saw the opportunity to start-up a business in her house. As the place where her house is located was a new delivery point, she decided to start with a few products such as soft drinks, sweets and fire wood.  As a result she had few customers as the area wasn't very populated but with the little she sold she was able to increase her stock which would serve right up to the present day when as a result of this source of income she has been able to obtain all that's necessary for the maintenance of her family.  The loan is for wok capital designated for the purchase of more products for her grocery in order that she can quickly satisfy customer demand.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":264302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Work Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":590.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":590.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400038},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092036},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985419},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:57Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446034},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":590.91,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":597.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956672},{"amount":177.26,"local_amount":3545.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3586.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174095}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T16:25:21Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":90953,"name":"Mohamad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohamad is a 44-year-old man who lives in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, with his wife and their four children.

They live together in the community of Manitea Alta, located in the beautiful Cuzque\u00f1an rainforest, where they have their own house made of wood.  Nineteen years ago Victor did not have capital to invest in a business, but thanks to the help of his family he was able to establish himself in the cultivation of cocoa.  At times he receives help from his family, but at harvest time he hires and supervises workers who help him with the harvest of his product.   Now he has found a niche in the market, and for this reason the production of this fruit is generating a good income for him.  But he is aware that there is much that he lacks to be able to grow.  For this reason, he has an ambitious plan, so that he will be able to meet the needs of his customers.  His plan is to buy land to cultivate other products that are in high demand.  His products are sold at a collection center in his own community.  This is his 4th loan with MFP, and he is committed to making his payments according the payment schedule.  In addition, he feels good about the work with his communal group.  With the money he requests he will buy land with the objective of cultivating cocoa, so that he can supply his potential buyers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":551664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy lands to cultivate cocoa","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3062.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326788}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T16:37:54Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":210615,"name":"Mareme","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Mareme D. est une ancienne soci\u00e9taire  de la caisse de Ouakam ou elle est membre depuis 8 ans.

She travels a long distance to be able to leave her house and get to the center of town and she has to do this because there is no transport service available unless she pays for a special taxi but no one does this because it\u2019s a service that is way too expensive. \r\n\r\nThe community is pretty because there is an abundance of corn fields and crops.  Everyone has a field and takes advantage of water from a huge dam to water them. People in this place have their animals.  Many people have sheep, pigs and chickens and there\u2019s always someone around who has cattle.\r\n\r\nIrma raises pigs to sell.  She\u2019s been doing this for five years and she tells us that the difficulties she has in raising them is the feed because they are a bit delicate and one has to strive to keep them clean and that they don\u2019t eat whatever they see that can hurt them.  They also have to be freed from parasites so that they\u2019ll be healthier.  \r\n\r\nIrma\u2019s goals are to have more animals.  She wants to arrange a corral to hold more pigs and to have sheep and if profits allow, buy cattle to have a complete herd of livestock.\r\n\r\nIrma has been living in a common law relationship for the past 14 years.  She is 35 years old and has three children who are in school.  She lives in her own house and her husband works as a driver but she wants to get ahead for her family so that they can improve the life they currently live.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":808763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to raise pigs to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-07-19T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.56,"local_amount":562.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":602.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223524},{"amount":85.94,"local_amount":937.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201806},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":803.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807396},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":803.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618491}],"funded_date":"2011-07-19T08:11:39Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":321258,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana is 32 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is 46 years old. Marietta is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Marietta owns & operates a fishing business, harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Marietta has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Marietta joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marietta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Marietta is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marietta from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Besides that, she manages to look after some cattle. The fact is that long ago, before their marriage, Suiun\u2019s husband already had some livestock. Suiun and her husband have made best use of their opportunities and have achieved great success in increasing the population of livestock and in improving the quality of their living. The livestock allowed them to meet various needs like providing education for their sons, buying convenience goods for the house and making repairs to their home, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty-five years, raising livestock has been an extra occupation and an extra source of income for the whole family, which every member of the family has shared concerns about. Suiun wants to continue dealing with cattle as it allows them to have quick and large amount of money whenever they need it. Therefore, she has applied for this loan to be able to buy two calves.\r\n\r\nSuiun\u2019s partners are Tolobek, Gulzat and Sveta:\r\n\r\nTolobek, 48, has three children and his wife is a teacher.

She and her husband work together making and selling charcoal.

He is very dedicated to his work and maintains frequent contact via cellphone with the parents of the children he transports, and with the schoolteachers, since he is not only responsible for transporting students but also for informing parents of school events and meetings. The cellphone is also one of the most secure ways to contact him directly when someone wants to hire his services.\r\nJorge is requesting a loan from Integral to buy some spare parts for his vehicle, and to provide all necessary maintenance to his vehicle.

She makes adult sports clothes, which she hopes to watch grow into a large company.  Since 2006, she studied design, cut, and tailoring at a technical college.  In 2008, after investigating her idea, she started her own business, purchasing a domestic sewing machine and beginning her work in her tiny apartment.  With discipline and responsibility, her capital began increasing little by little until she owned 5 semi-industrial sewing machines and dominated her neighborhood's market, keeping in mind that there is a lot of competition from other nearby workshops.  Currently, she is seeking her first financial loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that she felt encouraged to join for their available services.  She wants to add an industrial sewing machine in order to improve the finishing on her pieces and their production time.  Her dream is to expand her workshop and to offer a selection of products that capture the attention of potential clients located in other areas of her locality that have yet to know about her business.  Her main challenge has been winning her sector's market since she is surrounded by three other workshops.  Nonetheless, she is situated in front of an important shopping center, where there are accessible means of reaching her business and serve as a strategic point for its growth.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  Farming and buying and selling rice. Her husband Nestor F. is 55 years old.  He works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 3 children between 26 and 32 years old.  One child has a family and the other 2 are working. \r\n\r\nElisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future. Elisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its programs, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to pay for an additional game unit and stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for a future business expansion.

They have 30 quintals of coffee, orange trees, lemons, and avocados planted on 5 hectares.\r\n\r\nThis activity allowed them to save up the necessary capital to buy a small truck, which one of their older sons drives.  They provide freight services with this vehicle and move the harvests, most of the time crates of fruit, for their neighbors in town.

","en":"Shavkat has been involved in animal husbandry for over ten years, with the goal of increasing livestock headcount.  He spent several years working in Russia, and earning that money was not easy.  He returned home and got involved in animal husbandry right away.  Shavkat used his earnings to purchase eight heads of sheep and two heads of cattle and was able to increase livestock headcount over the years like this.  Currently, he has forty heads of sheep and six heads of cattle.  Today, he needs to expand the barn for his livestock because it will not fit there in the winter.  If Shavkat does not build a barn for the livestock, then he would have to sell some of the sheep, which would not be economical, since he is buying sheep at low prices now.  Shavkat is requesting a loan in the sum of 7000 Somoni to purchase construction materials to build a barn, and to use the rest of the money to purchase sheep and fodder for it.

Her three children, who were still young at the time, were the ones who motivated her to start her business. Thanks to a friend she was able to obtain the start-up capital to begin working, and she hasn't stopped since.\r\n\r\nShe used to work in people's houses, cleaning and doing laundry, but she left that work because she didn't have anyone to take care of her children, since she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nNow that she is 48 years old and her children are grown-up and independent, she not only sells fish but also prickly pears when they're in season. In the future she is thinking about selling food in her own home on the weekends, hoping to have work that is more stable and not as damaging to her physical health. She would also like to have a store, but that will require a larger investment and she must make sure the financial risk is worth it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":264394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy food to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-01-31T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":135,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.11,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":81.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393196},{"amount":18.89,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":18.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084886},{"amount":50,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978350}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T22:04:57Z","paid_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":91001,"name":"Nolasco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nInvirti\u00f3 para aumentar la mercanc\u00eda de su tienda.\nA sus sesenta y un a\u00f1os, Nolasco tiene a cargo el negocio que sustenta la familia, un hijo todav\u00eda menor de edad, y a su esposa inv\u00e1lida. \nNolasco dedic\u00f3 casi toda su vida a trabajos en diferentes empresas, como personal de limpieza principalmente, trabajo en el cual reci\u00e9n, en enero de este a\u00f1o, logr\u00f3 jubilarse y conseguir una pensi\u00f3n que lo ayude ahora a cubrir los gastos del hogar y de su familia.\nHace seis a\u00f1os su esposa perdi\u00f3 sus piernas, as\u00ed que el tuvo que encontrar una manera de trabajar y poder cuidar de ella a la misma vez.

Triunfaremos\" (We Will Succeed with Effort), are requesting their second loan since they've been clients of Esperanza International. This group of entrepreneurs lives in Consuelo, an area of San Pedro de Macoris known for being the hometown of baseball stars like Sammy Sosa. Consuelo was established around a sugar cane factory that is no longer operating. This has brought serious unemployment and left many acres of State-property land that are not being used right now because no one is planting on them after the sugar cane industry collapse. This has forced many people to become self-employed and set up their own businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nRoxana O. is the group representative and has a miscellaneous store.

For the last four years she has operated a store from her home and, little by little, and with the help of loans from EDAPROSPO, she has improved both her economic and personal status. She will invest the majority of the loan of S\/ 1,000.00 [approximately US $340] to further supply her store and, with any leftover money, will improve her home.\n\nThe Alcom las Violetas is comprised of 10 members, is in its third cycle, and has until now spent a total amount of S\/ 8,400.00. Each member is dedicated to a different activity such as the sale of CDs, orange juice and candy, among others. They are very punctual and responsible clients that help each other out and do not allow any individual member to fail.

After she separated from her husband, she dedicated herself to taking care of her two children who were young at the time.  They live together in a house that took much effort to build.  Elena always had an interest in having her own business and so she worked as a traveling saleslady for several years.  Over time, she saved enough money to buy some products to open a grocery store from her home.  The children help with the business.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe works from 6pm to midnight, since demand in her area is greater at night.  Her business has to be well-stocked with a diversified line of products.  The grocery has been in operation for 5 years, thanks to the support of the children.  Elena hopes the investment she has made is worthwhile, because she has ambitions of expanding her shop and opening a bazaar where one can find a variety of products frequently requested by her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and she thanks her communal bank group for utilizing the power of its social network and demanding cooperation among the members.  Her loan of 2000 soles will be used to buy groceries and other new products that she would like to introduce into her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":356158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase her inventory of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-22T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":301.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":307.03},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":326.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":340.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":354.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":369.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.79},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.83,"local_amount":301.71,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":309.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212057},{"amount":103.62,"local_amount":307.03,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":314.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641598},{"amount":110.04,"local_amount":326.04,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":333.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081038},{"amount":114.99,"local_amount":340.72,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":349,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997188},{"amount":119.79,"local_amount":354.94,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":363.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842532},{"amount":124.73,"local_amount":369.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":378.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734108}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T05:05:53Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":127867,"name":"Buligo United Nabatazi Shifa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

For the past 2 years she has dedicated her professional career to the sale of fuel like petroleum, gasoline, and kerosene. Her business is known for selling unadulterated fuel, and for this she earns about 280 Soles per day in profits. For supplies, Laxmi travels every three days to the location where the tap is located that provides said fuel at the lowest price, and in this way she is able to sell it at a modest price. Because of this all of her clients prefer doing business with her. Laxmi is very content with her business, and even more because her husband primes the cylinders for the fuel in an appropriate location so that she does not have to bear so much weight and so that she does not contaminate her children. In the past her loans were under her husband's name, but she attended all of the meetings of the community bank and because of this decided to change the ownership of the loan and Laxmi feels very much a part of the group. Futhermore, she is the treasurer and she is in charge of the monthly collections. The money that she is requesting she will invest in the purchase of cylinders and more fuel. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":386360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing her commodities and purchasing cylinders","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-10T16:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2563.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717251}],"funded_date":"2009-09-11T12:26:58Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Schapiro","image":null}},{"id":140214,"name":"Justus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justus is 27 years old.

Her name is Cirila G.. She lives in Yulo\u2019s Park, Brgy 14, Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She is 53 years old and is married to Rogelio G. who helps her in running their business. The couple is blessed with three adult children and some of them have their own families already.  Cirila is happy to have three grandchildren.\r\n\r\nBecause she had the knowledge and skills to make \u201cBibingka\u201d, a native Ilonggo delicacy that is made with rice flour, coconut milk, sugar and young coconut strips cooked in a top-fired oven, she started this business in 1996 with the help of her husband. They set up a cart with a specially made \"bibingka\" oven that enabled them to make and sell hot \"bibingka\" in different places that have high foot traffic. On Sundays, they setup their mobile \"bibingka\" bakery in front of the cathedral where Sunday mass goers could buy their product when they come out of the church after attending mass. On weekdays, they setup in front of schools with high student population. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to gain access to additional capital for her business. Because of the additional capital, she was able to improve her business income so that on the 3rd cycle, she decided to invest her loan not on her \"bibingka\" business but instead invest it in a backyard pig-fattening venture. This gave her a good return on her business after three to four months when she sold the pigs, enabling her to increase her income even further. The two ventures give her a combined average income of PHP 3,000 per week, which pays for their household expenses and school expenses, with some left over for savings.\r\n\r\nCirila is happy that her husband and children also help out in her business. For one week this October, they have setup their mobile store at the Bacolod Public Plaza because of the high pedestrian traffic in the area when Bacolod City celebrates its weeklong \"Masskara\" Festival. Cirila's \"Bibingka\" has gathered many regular customers and she has started receiving advance orders.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed Php 27,000, which she used as additional capital for her business and it was fully paid on time and in full within her loan term. Now she is borrowing for her 12th cycle, a loan of Php 29,500 to be used as additional working capital for her business. The income from it will be be used to improve the living conditions of her family and some will be set aside as savings for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":405566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Other borrowers make handicrafts or work in repairing broken household items, dressmaking, and weaving.  Some borrowers work in sales, selling food, clothing, and maintaining their grocery shops.\n \nThis group's objective is to grow in their respective businesses and reach their goals, while promoting their quality products.

She will use this loan to purchase more materials for her artisan work in order to expand the diversity of her products.\n\nThe experience that they have had with Fondo Esperanza, according to Jocelyn, has surpassed the group's expectations. Beyond giving them the tools they need to meet their businesses' needs, they have felt an unparalleled quality of people among the group's members and they have found this very gratifying.\n\nThe Chilean province of Talca is located in the Maule region of central Chile. Maule has the largest rural population of any of Chile's 15 regions.  Its citizens typically work in farming and agriculture.  Talca is known for its beautiful artisan work, colonial architecture, vineyards, and scenery.  \n

Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her daughter helps her to make the decorations for important celebrations because detail work on Styrofoam is difficult to do alone.

Her husband, Jumabek, is a pensioner and helps her in the household. Four years ago, in order to find means of subsistence and to make some savings for old age, Narynkul decided to engage in cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nUsing her starting capital of only 2,000 KGS, Narynkul decided to start her business in cattle breeding and bought bull calves. She concentrated all her efforts on supporting and expanding her household and managed to raise her capital to 40,000 KGS.  Now, Narynkul wants to take out a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy three bull-calves and four sheep for fattening and reselling. With the revenues from this investment, Narynkul plans to develop her farm by means of livestock breeding. In the future, she dreams to open a small shop with meat products. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Marites has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Marites is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.
