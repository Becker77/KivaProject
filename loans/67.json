It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Isabela, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Rosine is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy more stock to sell. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosine aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is convinced that the variety of products she offers increases her sales.  For this reason, she takes a lot of care not to repeat designs.  In addition, she makes good income from selling her own creations.  \"My husband helps me in making my tapestries and blankets\" Enma says \"while I knit with wooden needles\".  In this way, Enma is able to pay for her children's education.  She has been in this business for 20 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her handicrafts to her sales stall as she lives a very long way away.  However, she is comforted by the fact that she is putting together some money in order to be able to buy her own vehicle as she also receives a percentage of .400 to .500 Peruvian soles from charging people in her area for electricity.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Enma hopes to put together the money she needs to set up a store where she can sell her items more peacefully.  She belongs to the 'Mujeres al Futuro' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goals.

The flood-tide of any kind of business success, however, comes with an unwavering hard work ethic, enterprise, tenacity and a sense of determination.

Along the way, notwithstanding, he has had to grapple with the inevitable hurdles that come with running any kind of business. He was mostly hard pressed in consolidating his finances in his business's fledgling years. This, in a way, meant stagnation in his activity. He had less farm inputs like harvest baskets, hoes for weeding, etc. He was also hard pressed in purchasing better manure for his farms. In the face of all this, his philosophy was to remain upbeat and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nAmos says he set forth in his business with savings from his coffee sales enterprise. He plys his business in Kihihi, in the West of Uganda. He has not dispensed with the coffee sales business, however. Amos says, though, that he has much more leeway to make up. Where he has gotten so far is encouraging. He plans on buying more land to expand his tea farming business.\r\n\r\nMonthly this business's gross profits total up to Uganda shillings 250,000. Amos says he intends to utilize this Kiva Loan to purchase high grade manure for his

This is 39-year-old Hawa M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 2 and 14. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting 2 dependants because their parents had passed away due to HIV\/AIDS.<p>\r\nHawa has been running a kuku (chicken) business since 2007. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing, they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.<p>\r\nShe works at the business 16+ hours a day, 7 days a week, with the help of her children when they are home from school. She is requesting a loan of $250 in order to build a chicken coop so she has more room for more chickens to expand her business. Hawa thanks you for her support!<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":220712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To build a chicken coop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970726},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886943},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436203},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130476},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027278},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613301},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010384},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232695},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664511}],"funded_date":"2008-11-08T08:48:33Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Wigg","image":1373520}},{"id":76821,"name":"Mrs. Sarun Nop Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The village bank which consists of seventeen members is located in Angk Ta Nu village in Takeo Province.

Not having had the chance to go to school due to societal reasons, she chose to work to earn an income.  Thus, she decided to become specialize in making and selling \"djafarana\" powder about 17 years ago.  She learned how to do this from a woman from Cote d'Ivoire who had come to Sikasso to make it her principal business.  \r\n\r\nThis powder, commonly called \u201cdjafarana mugu\u201d or \u201ctamati mugu\u201d, is made with millet, the seeds of the djafarana tree or plant, and shea nut butter.  She pounds the millet and the djafarana seeds to make the powder, to be mixed with shea nut butter, in turn yielding the powder itself as mentioned. \r\n\r\nT\u00e9r\u00e9ko has been collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso for five years now.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association of her area, she is on her second individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  With the current loan, she intends to buy three sacks of millet, eight sacks of \"djafarana\" seeds, and 30 kg of shea nut butter.  Supplies of the seeds, millet, and the butter are gotten in towns surrounding Sikasso City (Loulouni, Lobougoula, Gnangasso, etc.) by special order. \r\n\r\nHer business cycle is very rapid, and she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used to ensure that certain expenses are covered, to help her husband support the family, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is 30 years old. Charlen is married and has 3 school-aged children. Charlen owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Charlen has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Charlen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Charlen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Charlen is requesting a new loan, her third, of 11,000 PHP, which will also be used to expand the business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

K., 32, is married to a businessman and they have two children, 6 and 10 years old. Her business is located in a busy market in Mwingi that has a lot of goat selling activities taking place. She is, however, served by the Thika branch of SMEP. She has been in this business for the last three years. She says that the business is profitable and the only major challenge she faces is the means to transport the goats to the market. However, she works very hard to keep her business going well.

Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supoorts her family. \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy seeds and fertilizers for her farming.  In the future, Rachana plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He has two children. Yuri is 22 years old, and Joel is 17 years old.  Prudencio lives in his own house and tries very hard to provide a better life for his children.  Prudencio works as a farmer, where he cultivates cocoa plants.  He works very hard on the farming field.  He has been working for 30 years on his own land.  During the planting season, he counts on the support of his children and day laborers who see to the planting and move the collected products to a certain place so that later in can be transported with small vehicles.  He feels very dedicated to his work.  Thanks to his daily effort, today he enjoys seeing his plants give him a good crop.  He says that he does not like the winter season because there is a large quantity of insects and rain during those months, damaging his floral fields.  With the loan that he is asking for, he will buy more pineapple seeds to expand his sown fields.  This is his 11th loan with MFP.  He knows that if he pays it on time, he will be able to obtain another loan with greater ease and will not bring complications to his communal bank where he is well-liked by the rest of the members.  With the 1,000 nuevos soles, he will buy chemical and fertilizer products to maintain his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":981636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chemical and fertilizer products to maintain his plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prudencio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451261}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T10:36:53Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Dupre","image":170204}},{"id":413879,"name":"Doreces","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doreces lives in Buluk.

Yudaya takes care of additional family members. The family gets three meals a day.  She incurs additional transport costs to and from shopping in Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda. She sells to all categories of people but mainly to schoolchildren because she resides near the school.

On average, she receives 50 customers a day. Her business premise is her residence. Yudaya has been in this business for eight years and with MCDT for four years, servicing her eighth loan. She has worked all along with the same group mates. Her monthly expenses include school fees for her child and feeding the family. Yudaya wants to use this loan to buy more boxes of biscuits, cooking oil and wheat flour for frying chapatti and samosas.

She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Sela currently earns about 150USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more shop items such as cartons of sugar, soap, salt and cooking oil in bulk.  In the future, she plans to increase the size of her business. Sela thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":430610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more shop items such as cartons of sugar, soap, salt and cooking oil in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757735},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146829},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984974},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015647},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740653},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773767}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T07:40:42Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":158979,"name":"Nelly Atieno","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelly Atieno O., 31, is married and has four children ranging from the age of 4 to 13.

Barring the achievements he has registered, he is still behind schedule in many of his other set objectives. It\u2019s for this reason that he wants this loan.

Nurlan Manapovich was born in Orlovka village (Kemin region) where he still lives at the moment. He\u2019s 37 years old. After graduating from school he went into the army. After this, he married Kanaeva Raihan, with whom he has four children: three daughters of school age and a little son who is only one and a half years old. Nurlan works as a security guard in the Altynken goldmine. Nurlan\u2019s spouse is a housewife.\r\n\r\nSince Nurlan is the only breadwinner in a large family, being a hard-working, responsible and enterprising man, he decided to open up a small shop in his garage three years ago. The garage was refurbished into a shop within one week. With a part of his salary of 3,000 Kyrgyz Soms, Nurlan bought groceries. The range of products in his corner shop was not sufficient, and after thinking for a while and considering all the risks, Nurlan got his first loan from Bai Tushum & Partners. Thus, he could widen the range of products and his shop, which he runs with his wife and older children (in their spare time), allows them to earn some extra money. The shop is open 24\/7 and Nurlan has his permanent customers, to whom he gives some discounts and, in case of need, lends goods.\r\n\r\nAbout one month ago, Nurlan\u2019s shop was robbed. More than half of the goods (with a value of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms) and the sale proceeds of a whole day were stolen. It was a big loss for Nurlan, but he quickly gathered his courage again. In view of the importance of the additional revenue from the shop for his family, Nurlan wants to obtain a loan of 40,000 Kyrgyz Soms to restock his shop with products.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing for Nurlan is his family; he wants to provide his children with a good education. This in turn will allow them help advance their country and their

Currently she only has light services; they are in the process of installing water services. \r\n\r\nFor more than 2 years, she has had a store where she offers a sale to her neighbors and customers in the area on a variety of everyday consumer products including staple items and groceries.

She lives with her partner, 38 year-old Daniel, and they have three children.  They own their own home in Santa Rosa district.\r\n\r\nMarina learned farming techniques and how to care for cacao plantations when she was still very young.  However, things didn't all go well for her and her family.  They suffered some damage to their crops, there weren't any buyers in their community and there were constant landslides in their area.  As a result, everything they invested in their crops was a complete loss.  For two years, Marina was paying off debts that she had with her suppliers and her workers.  However, she recovered her confidence and continued committing herself aggressively to her farming.  This time she sowed a new coffee product.  Since then her sales have increased compared to other years and now she has agreements with her customers.\r\n\r\nIn general, Marina works alongside her husband.  However, at harvest time she needs to hire laborers in order to make her harvesting go more smoothly.  She normally sells her crops to the food warehouses in her community.  Marina will use the loan she has requested to buy cacao plants which she will later graft.  Her future plans are to buy more land and to start growing citrus fruits.\r\n\r\nThis is Marina's eighth loan from MFP and she pledges to continue making her repayments on time.

Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de productos de belleza en la siguiente campa\u00f1a de ofertas.  \n\n","en":"Marisol is 36 years old, single, and she lives in alone in a house she rents. She has been selling beauty products for the past 7 years. Her sales method is to take orders from her clients that choose products from catalogues that Marisol displays. When the products arrive she distributes to the clients who requested them. She has a display case where she displays the various products in stock that way clients have an option on choosing and there are more advantages to gain. She needs a loan to purchase products to have in supply and when they are on sale to immediately offer then at a better price. She will secure more income this way. This is her 4th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she feels that participating in a group loan has been one of the best decisions she has made with regards to the development of her business. She feels very thankful and she will once again begin this work with the group of her communal bank. She gives her word to keep on being on time with her payments. With the loan that she requests she will invest in the purchase of beauty products on sale in the next campaign."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":770943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase beauty products for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-19T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":218.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":221.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":236.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":245.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":253.53},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":265.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":276.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":286.41},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":296.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.12,"local_amount":200.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":204.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550327},{"amount":80.85,"local_amount":218.53,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":223.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719004},{"amount":82,"local_amount":221.62,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":226.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850958},{"amount":178.23,"local_amount":481.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":492,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621234},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":126.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":129.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245200},{"amount":111,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":306.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714202},{"amount":34.18,"local_amount":92.37,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":94.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099049},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":153.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402125},{"amount":71.59,"local_amount":193.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":197.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456614},{"amount":120.85,"local_amount":326.63,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":333.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452395},{"amount":69.8,"local_amount":188.63,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":192.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869160}],"funded_date":"2011-06-01T03:53:00Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303038,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos es un joven trabajador  de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive en casa de su madre en la zona urbana marginal del distrito de M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque.

She buys from delivery vans that pick up the charcoal from the villages and then deliver it directly to her home. Besides her charcoal business, she also sells airtime. Her major business challenges include thieves, ever-increasing charcoal prices, the rainy season which hinders her customers from reaching her, and even the delivery cost of transporting the charcoal.  She has been in this business for over fifteen years and with MCDT for twelve years.  She is now requesting her fourteenth loan.

There are 5 members: Humberto Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Rodr\u00edguez who sells tamales and maize drinks, Anastasio D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda who wants to start a business (magazines and newspapers), Antolina X. F., who sells catalog products (perfumes), Maria Elena O. M. (boiled corncobs and corn kernels), Eutimio G\u00f3mez T. (services, bricklaying).\r\n\r\nDon Tacho, as the other group members call him, is who we are going to talk about.  He is 63 years old, and is going to start a business selling magazines and newspapers.  He tells us that the neighborhood where he lives doesn\u2019t have a magazine stand.  Currently, he lives with his wife, Isabel Santamar\u00eda Nopaltlali, and they have 4 children: Arturo D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 39 years old (married), Macario D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 29 years old (married), Armando D. L. R. Santamar\u00eda, 27 yeards old (married), Carlos D. L. R.

Currently, he works in the country and, since he is now older, it is more difficult every day for him to find work.  This is why he needs this business, and to be able to grow it.\r\n\r\nHe is happy to have been given the opportunity to receive this credit, and he gives thanks ahead of time for the confidence placed in him.  Thanks to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad he can try to get ahead.

H., who is 53 years old and is in the business of selling rice and wheat. \r\n\r\nFarida is a housewife who also owns a buffalo and sells its milk to people who live in her community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Narra, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Arcelita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to fund her frozen foods business. This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arcelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He lives separately from his partner and they have a 6-year-old daughter named Yohalibet.  He is a responsible parent and does not neglect his duties as a father, paying monthly support.  He has his own house which is half-built in the community of Sampantuari Alta, located in the District of Quimbiri.  Edwin is a farmer and his parents taught him the trade when he was very young.  Since then, he has worked his own lands for the past six years where he grows the following products: cacao plants, coffee, and coca leaves.  During the harvest, he has the help of workers.  He knows very well that the money he earns is thanks to the good fruit production, which is why he sells them in the cities of San Francisco and Quimbiri where they pay him higher prices for the quality of his coffee beans, cacao, and coca leaves.  What he likes most about his work is the harvest, as he feels as though the months of hard work pay off in the quality of his fruits.  The loan requested is for the purchase of wood and corrugating roofing, as he plans to build his home using rustic materials.  He considers the most difficult part to be transporting his products from the farm to the dryers, located two hours away on foot.  In the future, he hopes to buy new lands to increase his production.  This is his first loan with MFP and he says that the loan will help him greatly to progress with his work.  He feels grateful to the lending institution for granting him the loan.  With the 1,500 Peruvian Nuevos Soles (PEN) requested, he will purchase wood and corrugated roofing to build his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":742021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy woof and corrugated roofing to build his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-30T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":106.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":109.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":114.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":121.55},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":131.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":140.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":145.26},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":150.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.27},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.45,"local_amount":107.59,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":110.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196452},{"amount":37.06,"local_amount":101.06,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270130},{"amount":40.04,"local_amount":109.21,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":112.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550150},{"amount":42.13,"local_amount":114.91,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":118.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718826},{"amount":391.32,"local_amount":1067.23,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1100.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350289}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T11:48:42Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":290760,"name":"Rakita Ole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rakita Ole N. is 36 years old, married and has two children.

be just the right words to describe 55-year-old Robert, who operates a retail enterprise in Lugazi. This enterprising father of 12 started giving a good account of himself in this trade a decade ago. Robert exudes nothing but confidence.\r\nHe set forth in his business on his own hook and all the strides he has made have come as a result of his unwavering and tenacious hard work ethic.\r\nIt\u2019s fair to say Robert is now on the inside lane to become a past master in business. He has soaked up loads of experience, and day in, day out, Robert feels he is getting well posted with the nitty gritty and fundamentals of running a business. Does this spell success for his enterprise? In many respects it does.\r\n\r\nHe has been able to handle most of his adversity philosophically. Robert has also made sure he does not get complacent as his business grows. Before he nurtured the idea of bearing a hand in this business, Robert was mostly inclined to a coffee selling business. His auxiliary businesses (to wit, cattle and food sales) have aided him in the consolidation of his business profits. Weekly, Robert says this business generates him sales returns totaling to Uganda shillings 25,000.\r\n\r\nThe records indicate that Robert's group is on their 4th loan cycle. Their repayment record is up to the mark. Robert says he is going to use his loan proceeds to purchase more retail commodities such as maize flour, beans, rice, salt, sugar, etc. to resell.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":870547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more retail commodities such as maize flour, beans, rice, salt, sugar, etc. to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jothan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halunah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":339953,"name":"Madelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madelyn is 46 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He has a customer base that knows him and places orders with him.

Her net profit amounts to 5,000 Grivnas a month. \n\nReflecting on how everything started, Tatyana confesses she is very happy she took the risk and ventured into the unknown, starting her own business. Looking back, she sees all her failures and successes and feels sure all her efforts were invested in the right cause. \n\nToday Tatyana would love to get another small loan of 1,500 Grivnas to increase her assortment of inventory and continue expanding her business. She is hoping to repay her loan in one month.  \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":231644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her assortment of inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Beregovo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.216667 22.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T20:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tatyana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1602.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14866279}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T21:54:15Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T13:04:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":80965,"name":"Dolores De La Concepci\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa se\u00f1ora Dolores de la Concepci\u00f3n es originaria de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n donde muy alegremente comercializa frutas desde muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana en una localidad a la intemperie en el mercado central por lo que requiere de inversi\u00f3n para obtener un tramo donde vender sus frutas y no estar exponi\u00e9ndose al sol y a la lluvia.\n\nPor estas razones es que ella ha acudido a Ceprodel para ser beneficiada con un cr\u00e9dito que le permita en este momento la compra de las frutas para su respectiva comercializaci\u00f3n y para continuar brind\u00e1ndole mejores condiciones a sus tres hijos en edades escolares.\n\n","en":"Dolores de la Concepcion is originally from the city of Leon where she very happily markets fruits beginning early in the morning in a location in the central open-air market.

The greatest challenge he is faced with is that he does not have the resources to be able to purchase materials for the service that he offers, and this has caused his work to decline, which affects not only his business but also his family, because there is less money for food.  On the other hand, he is also affected by the conditions in which he works, which are not safe enough.  Currently, he is renting the workshop where he works, and his dream is to be able to buy it some day.  He started up this small business thanks to the support that his father provided him.  Previously, he had sold fruit and vegetables in the streets of his municipality.  He has a family of four children and a wife who works and helps him with basic domestic expenses, such as water and electricity, among others.

The association, named after an important <i>marabout<\/i> (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a <i>tontine<\/i>, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  \r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC, a Kiva partner. Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments. CurrentL., there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. Coumba Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \r\n\r\nNdeye Fatim P. heads group No. 1. She is partners with her older sister, Arame P., who is also in the group. Together, they take turns making the trip to their aunt's farm to purchase peanuts to sell in the market of Grand Thies, a neighborhood in the middle of the city. They have been in the business for some six years.  Ndeye also sells breakfast to her neighbors, mainL. sandwiches with <i>ni\u00e9be<\/i> (bean spread), mayonnaise or tuna.\r\n  \r\nThe other three members are: Coumba L., who also sells peanuts; Mame Saye D., who sells Marmite cooking pots; and Diarra D., who sells detergents and soaps. Each member of the group receives 100,000 CFA francs to finance their activities.

They know each other well and all live in large traditional famlies with their husbands and children. They are 38 years of age on the average, and  each woman has at least four children. The women of the Djiguiya group trade in various articles: cereals, heating wood, preparation and sale of pancakes (such as the ones   Mariam B. bakes), clothing etc. In order to enlarge the scope of their activities, two years ago they have decided to take advantage of the loan programs of Soro Yiriwaso. Mariam B., who is in food sales, plans to use her loan in order to purchase millet grain, oil and sugar  at the big market of Kouiala and heating wood from the vendors of nearby towns. Je sells her pancakes each evening in front of her front door,  on the pavement by the Catholic mission school.  There is a lot of customer demand as she is good at baking pancakes and they are very popular. While other members of the Djiguiya group plan to obtain a monthly income of 80,000 West African Francs each, Mariam B. plans to achieve an income of 110,000 West African francs. In addition to repaying the loan, they will use the income to help meet the family expenses. They seek collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso in order to avoid running out of stock on their goods. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":522975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing millet grain and other ingredients for the preparation of pancakes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma\u00ef ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746621},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779177},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961380},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699495},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913400},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":100136.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180570}],"funded_date":"2010-04-15T14:36:32Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":196529,"name":"Josesa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josesa A. is from the village of Guinsiliban, Camiguin Province.

She has had her business for three years, starting with some capital she saved by working after she came from Haiti. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing, in different size, and for men, women and kids. She will re-invest the profits in her business because this is high season for sales. She dreams of having her own house and return to Haiti.\n\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she invested in her business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and the tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\n\nThe woman with face pic in the right

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for everyday expenses and to save for the future of her children.\r\n\r\nGemma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Gemma earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 450 Philippine Pesos in sales every day.   \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGemma hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Microfinance

as she is fondly known to her friends and customers, decided approximately a year ago to open her small grocery store in her house, which she built with much effort and sacrifice and with the help of

She has 0.5 hectare plot where she can cultivate rice. In this plantation, she now faces a small problem because her field is infertile which has a bad effect on her crop. To solve this problem, Mrs. Srey Hong M. has decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to amend her field to make it more productive.<P>\r\n\r\n Her husband, Mr. Uk Thon, is a laborer who can make US$ 2.50 per day which is very little to support the family. Mrs. Srey Hong M. is 45 years old and the mother of two children, one of whom is working in a garment factory while the younger one is attending the local school. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Three members have end-of-term loans and the other two have monthly payment loans. The former are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":303310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T16:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abigail M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613677},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010756},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233042},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:04Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664833},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105545},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":138229.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022670}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T13:02:50Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":105557,"name":"Kossiwa Ameniuade","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme est une r\u00e9sidente du quartier d\u2019adidogom\u00e9, elle est mari\u00e9e et a 01 enfant.

She lives in her own house and her greatest desires are based on the well-being of her family, which consists of her partner and her son who is only five years old.  She makes a living by gathering a large quantity of stones of diverse colors and shapes, to later send them to her sister, who lives in Argentina and is in charge of converting the stones into precious jewels.  For this task, Maritza is in contact with various people from other cities, above all from the country's jungle, where the most extraordinary collections are found.  She has been doing this business for 5 years and the thing that she likes most is being connected to people from other cities, who share her passion for collecting stones for exportation.  However, she considers the most difficult part transferring the merchandise to the capital, because they are very expensive and heavy, and therefore requires the support of her partner on some occasions.  In the future, Maritza hopes to travel to other countries and make contacts with entrepreneurs who work in the production of jewelry.\r\n\r\nThis is Maritza's fourteenth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, where she has always shown commitment to her communal bank and stands out for her enthusiasm.

Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a northern port town which is economically-focused on tourism.  In Puerto Plata, running water (which is not potable) and electricity are unreliable.  She makes her home here in a simple structure, and she lives with her long-term partner and their child. <p>\r\n\r\nEdlina is excited to be seeking her third loan through Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans.  She plans to use this loan to invest in her business.  To earn a living, she sells clothing and food; more specifically, she purchases pants, polo shirts, sheets, curtains, rice, sugar, flour, oil, and cups, and she either sells these goods (in the case of the clothes) or cooks with them (in the case of the food, which she later sells).  She will use the profits generated as a result of the loan to invest in her home and her family.  In particular, she would like to purchase chairs for her home and a backpack, shoes, and clothes for her child.  Her long-term goal is to save enough money so that she can send some money home to Haiti to finish building her home.  She thanks all of you for your support.

The malt is produced in a series of phases.  First, the corn is soaked in a rectangular stone well ten inches deep for 12-14 hours.  The soaking water is periodically replaced to remove any grass or other debris.  The entire process can last between 8 to 15 days.  The corn is then provided enough exposure to the sun until it germinates.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
