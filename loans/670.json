She is 43 years old. Crisanta is married and has seven school-age children. To make a living, Crisanta owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as sugar, salt, vinegar, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Crisanta has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Crisanta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Crisanta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Crisanta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the range of products offered. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Crisanta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our field partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":489260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new items to expand the range of products offered","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sumalig.

It is human nature to seek fault with someone else, and usually people find someone or something to blame: their boss, the government, life in general, anything but themselves. Nevertheless, there are people who, instead of assigning blame, do their best in order to change their lives for the better. All members of the group being presented is middle-class. No one has any special financial advantage. The leader of the group is Damira B.. She is 32 years old. She is married and lives with her family in the town of Karabalta. In order to help her husband meet the family expenses, three years ago she started a business retailing various everyday goods (foodstuffs, matches, salt, sugar etc). Before launching this business, she discussed it with her sister, and they invested their savings jointly. Now, three years later, Damira has a monthly income of 8,000 somos ($180). Moreover, her business made it possible for her to buy a car. Now Damira needs a loan. She needs it in order to buy a new stock of goods for the upcoming season of spring holidays. In the future, she hopes to buy a retail kiosk.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Damira, there are three more individuals in this group:\r\nAlfiya F. is 31 years old. She is married and has two children.

Sometime ago he was working as a welder\u2019s assistant, but later he decided to work independently. Now Alfiya\u2019s husband is in need of a loan. He needs to purchase work supplies.\r\n\r\nJyldyz B.-K. is 27 years old. Jyldyz\u2019 husband works in a private company. Jyldyaz has two children. The children are still young, and so it mostly falls to the husband to provide for the family. He also resells sheep on the side. Jyldyz is hoping to obtain a loan in order to buy sheep for resale. \r\n\r\nBekjan S. is 23 years old. He is single, and his business is passenger transport. Three years ago he and his brother bought a car and started a taxi business. Bekjan also supports his 14-year old sister.

She is applying for another loan in order to expand her activity a little more and to satisfy better her customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":516244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cassava","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Allada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-29T11:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8571.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":8571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653393},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835600},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575997},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954511},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056168},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":8571.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347703},{"amount":17.86,"local_amount":8571.42,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-22T09:33:59Z","rounded_local_amount":8723.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482759}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T13:05:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-22T09:33:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":193900,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nFrancisco es un padre de familia de 46 a\u00f1os de edad que vive junto a su esposa y sus hijos en el sector Molino El Carmen del distrito de Motupe,un distrito que pertenece a la provincia de Lambayeque y que se encuentra ubicado a una hora y cuarenta y cinco minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica a trabajar en labores agr\u00edcolas desde que era joven, empez\u00f3 trabajando como pe\u00f3n agr\u00edcola en diversos cultivos de la zona y con mucho esfuerzo pudo adquirir hace cinco a\u00f1os un terreno agr\u00edcola propio en donde suele sembrar ma\u00edz, el suele poner todo su esfuerzo en esta actividad ya que de ella depende el mantenimiento de su familia.\n\nEl cultivo ya esta muy avanzado y dentro de poco dar\u00e1 frutos, Francisco quiere asegurarse una buena producci\u00f3n brindandole riegos y fertilizantes, por ello se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que le ayuden a realizar la actividad propuesta.\n\nFrancisco es una persona bastante empe\u00f1osa y trabajadora, su mayor anhelo es seguir creciendo como empresario para brindarle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.

He relies solely on the income from his farming activities to cater for his family's needs. His main challenge in this business is the low price of bananas, especially during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nGodfrey has requested this KES 46,800 loan from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This loan will improve his family's living standard because, with the income from selling milk, he will be able to construct a house and the family will have enough milk for consumption.\r\n\r\nIn future, Godfrey plans to acquire more cows and construct a zero-grazing shed (to raise improved breeds of livestock under confined conditions in order to make better use of limited land area, feed and organic resources). He plans to lease more banana plantation land to increase his income.\r\n\r\nGodfrey says that Juhudi loans are repaid monthly and this gives him ample time to look for money compared to other organizations where they repay weekly.

Thanks to the profits they have made from baking bread, she has been able to buy a car that enables them to sell the bread in communities that are farther away. Her customers are grateful to her, since they can now buy bread in their communities without having to go far away, in addition to the fact that her bread has a different flavor than other bread. Matilde is seeking this new loan to buy flour and to buy more baskets to increase her production and so meet her goals. She is fighting to give her children a better education. She comments that she would not like her children to live through and suffer what they did. She would like to give them careers so that they have a better life.

She has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy a young dairy cow.  In the future, Radha plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Katmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Rael always says, \u201cI eat from my sweat.\" Her primary sources of income are milk and planting different varieties of crops. <br \/><br \/>Because of poor productivity on her farm and reaping nothing, Rael wants to diversify and start sheep farming. The Kapsowar area has a ready market for sheep meat (mutton) and wool, hence she will not have a need to go and look for a market. Being a hardworking mother, Rael has always ensured that she puts food on the table for her family. She also ensures she is able to take her children to school. <br \/><br \/>Rael detests living in conditions of poverty and she has a plan to improve her standard of living.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All of the members have incomes independent of each other, so there is no risk of dependence within the group. The majority of the members work selling products including cosmetics, meat, party favours, food, clothing and groceries, or work in the service sector offering computer repair, house painting and public transport services. \r\n\r\nWithin the commercial sphere there is competition between supply and demand, and the members rely on being able to offer high quality products at low prices. They also draw on their capacity to make progress despite any obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy basic supplies and materials to improve their businesses, increase their income and improve the quality of life for their families. Within the group some members have previous experience with solidarity groups, while others are receiving their first loans but feel able to fulfil their obligations to the group and to the Agrocapital Foundation, which offers them the opportunity of credit on favourable terms.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":275814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-03-03T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jassivi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1860.8},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1882.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1903.87},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1925.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1947.94},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1970.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1993.03},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2016}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":270.19},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":273.3},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":276.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":286.1},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":289.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":810.6,"local_amount":5646.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:25:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5690.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091183},{"amount":276.44,"local_amount":1925.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1940.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091184},{"amount":279.62,"local_amount":1947.94,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1962.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984506},{"amount":282.84,"local_amount":1970.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984507},{"amount":286.1,"local_amount":1993.03,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445077},{"amount":289.4,"local_amount":2016,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2031.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445078}],"funded_date":"2009-03-06T21:25:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Bolton","image":517266}},{"id":94737,"name":"Mrs. Nhor Martt Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank, which consists of 13 members, is located in the Kor village in the Takeo province.

In this plantation, she faces an obstacle because the field is infertile; thus, she decided to request a loan to buy fertilizer to make her crop more productive. Her husband, Mr. Um Sam Arth, is a cook who is hired by people for wedding ceremonies, festival ceremonies, parties, and so on. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nhor M. is 51 years old and the mother of three children: one is a security guard, another stays at home to do housework, and the remaining one attends the local school.

They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

padres. Desde hace m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de artesan\u00edas, paralelamente vende fruta por pedidos que lleva a las casas de sus clientes. Las artesan\u00edas las vende en un puesto cercano al centro de su ciudad, todos los d\u00edas por las ma\u00f1anas y para incrementar su mercader\u00eda tambi\u00e9n vende art\u00edculos que no fueron hechos por ella misma. Nora comenta que las temporadas m\u00e1s exitosas para su negocio son para fiestas patrias (julio), navidad (diciembre) y otro tipo de celebraciones, como las fiesta patronales y c\u00edvicas de su ciudad. En los a\u00f1os de experiencia que tiene en esta actividad ha ido aprendiendo a crear y mejorar los dise\u00f1os de los art\u00edculos que realiza. El deseo a futuro de Nora es tener un puesto de ventas con grandes y bonitas vitrinas para exhibir sus artesan\u00edas. Esta es la tercera vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP y durante este tiempo de trabajo en grupo ha notado que ha crecido como persona, esto la anima a continuar con esta modalidad de cr\u00e9dito. El dinero que viene solicitando ser\u00e1 destinado a la compra de los materiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n de sus artesan\u00edas (mu\u00f1ecas, mantas t\u00edpicas, etc.), tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1 art\u00edculos de madera ya elaborados y fruta al por mayor. ","en":"Nora is a hardworking woman who is 31 years old.  She lives with her son in her parents' home.  For more than 3 years, she has been making and selling handicrafts, and at the same time, she accepts orders for fruit and delivers them to her customers\u2019 homes. Every morning, she sells her crafts from a stall near the center of the city.  To increase her inventory, she also sells works produced by other artists.  Nora says the best times for her business are during the holidays, mainly Founder\u2019s Day (July), Christmas (December), and other celebrations such as patron saint festivals and civic gatherings.   In her years of experience making handicrafts, she has learned to improve the design of her creations.  Nora hopes that in the future she will have a shop with large beautiful display cases for exhibiting her work.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and during that time, her fellow members have noticed that she has developed as a person.  She is encouraged to continue taking advantage of this form of credit.  The money she is requesting will be used to buy materials used in her creations (dolls, traditional blankets, etc.).  She will also purchase finished pieces of wood and fruit in bulk.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":355096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase craft materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-20T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212041},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641576},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081016},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997166},{"amount":600,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1806.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842510}],"funded_date":"2009-07-21T03:41:44Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":127505,"name":"Gina Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora GINA ELIZABETH R.

Liutofaga  needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liutofaga  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Liutofaga 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Liutofaga  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International: \r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

She wants a larger amount of capital to be able to purchase more pigs. She started this business in 2004 in order to augment her husband\u2019s income as a farmer. With their children\u2019s needs, Josephine and her husband\u2019s sporadic incomes are insufficient to be able to grow their businesses at the same time.\r\n\r\nStarting her business with a few pigs to be raised and sold after a period of time, Josephine then became a member of ASHI where she has been able to obtain a loan, so her ability to raise more pigs has improved.  Her husband has been supporting her and has been partnering her in running the business. Out of the profit Josephine is making through her business, she has been able to support her grandchildren\u2019s education and she hopes that her business will grow more in order to support her family\u2019s dreams. \r\n\r\nHer long term goals are to have a full-fledged hog fattening business, to invest in her home, and to have a sustainable secondary farming business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":599565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

G. is a member of the Huitzililla group.  She is 38 years old, lives in common law union with her husband who is a field day laborer.  She finished 5th grade.  She has three children, a boy and two girls.  Santiago is 21 and works in Cuautla in a shoe store.  Arisbeth, 16, is in school and works in a natural products store.  Lorenza, 12, is in school.\r\n\r\nMargarita has a grocery store and also sells Jafra brand catalogue products.  She asked for the loan to buy soap, soft drinks, candies, soups, cooking oil, sugar and eggs to stock her store.  The store is called \u201cAbarrotes Pe\u00f1a\u201d and it was passed down to her by her in-laws.  She started the business two years ago when she still had her mother-in-law.  She has since passed away and left the store to her and she tends to it now.  She offers her customers, who are her neighbors, beverages, candies, Sabritas (brand of snacks), Gamesa (cracker and cookie brand), Marinela (packaged pastry brand) and Jafra catalogue products. The store is in her home.  Her son Santiago helps out on Sundays.\r\n\r\nShe considers her store to be important because it provides benefits for her family; it has helped her provide her children\u2019s education.  She enjoys taking care of her customers and feels proud to produce family income for any emergency and not having to seek out someone to get a loan from. She uses profits for household expenses and to buy more merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe faces competition from two other stores near hers.  Her plans and hopes are to continue in business and to sell more.  Her hopes for her children are that they continue to study and be in good health.  She hopes to reach these goals by working hard at sales so that the business grows.\r\n\r\nMargarita likes the town of Huitzililla because that\u2019s where she was born and where she lives.  They plant onions in irrigated fields and corn and sorghum seasonally.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":605601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy soap, soft drinks, soups, cooking oil, sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huitzililla, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121215},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415391},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415392},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554975},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4544.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691465},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2272.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430649}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T01:21:21Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":238988,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine M., 32, has been operating a grocery store in Nyalenda estate in Kisumu City for the past 11 years.

For this reason, and because Fredy is a very inteligent person, he also raises livestock, especially sheep, hogs, and guinea pigs, which he cares for and sells at a good price, covering his family's costs of living.

Her son, who is a teacher, visits them on weekends.  Norma was a member of Banco Mujer in the area known as R.R.P.M and she obtained several loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer.  She repaid all her loans on time and held the post of treasurer.  Norma is an organized and very hard-working woman.  She would like to restart her business in premises which are located in her home with the aim of continuing to support her family.  Norma's business has important assets and she also has capital to invest.  Her loan will support her business activity.  \r\n\r\nNorma has five years experience in this business.  In the beginning, her husband supported her with capital.  Once Banco Mujer was formed, she obtained two loans which she invested in merchandise but she sold her products to her customers door to door.  On this occasion, with her existing assets, she would like to continue offering her services to her customers but from her own premises.  With this loan, the client will invest 300,000 colones in buying merchandise and have inventory valued at 150,000 colones.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this business activity, the client also makes rental income from two premises belonging to her family.  When she re-starts her business, she plans to have a two-month adaptation period since she must get her premises ready (cleaning and decoration).  For this reason, she is presenting a revenue forecast.  She will cover the initial repayments of her loan with the rent she makes, which is why a grace period is not being awarded.\r\n \r\nNorma has business premises located in a large residence, at the entrance to R\u00edo Fr\u00edo.  There is evidence of this in the presence of a large store there.  She plans to re-open these premises and continue serving her customers who come from neighboring properties.  She has the support of her husband and five years experience in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":803239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In the first round of funding she borrowed 200USD to raise pigs, by the year\u2019s end she took in 120 USD.  Although she was able to put the loan to good use, Ms. N. realized that raising pigs does not make enough money to pay for her children\u2019s schooling; her husband still has to work as a bricklayer to bring more income.  In addition to 2000 USD of capital that she raised herself, Ms. N. plans to borrow 950USD to buy decoration equipment and flower gates to serve weddings.  She makes the weekly payments from investments in a wedding hall and her husband\u2019s sidejob.

For a little over a year now, she achieved her dream and feels extremely satisfied.  Now, she must purchase more cows to build her stable.  As a result of her cattle activities, she is able to sell the milk they produce which is why she is meticulous in caring for her animals.

She has worked in this business for 20 years and knows that the most difficult part is harvesting the crops that she sells, since she has to bring them all the way from her farmland on the outskirts of Juliaca.  This is her 5th loan from Prisma Microfinance and she has always been punctual with her payments and she hopes to be now as well.  She is the happiest member of her village bank and is always making the other members laugh.  She will use the money to invest in her farmland to increase her production and, in that way, grow her sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":275870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Increase her agricultural production to grow her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-22T15:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117140},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012053},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595639},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989900},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211032},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640528}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T17:22:58Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":94753,"name":"Trob","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trob M., 50, lives with her husband in the Siem Reap province.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Bernadito, who is 65 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have nine children who are 25 to 43 years old. \r\n\r\nMaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 9 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her last loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,500 PHP, improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase additional stock for her general store.  She hopes the additional income will help her continue to save up for house repair. Maria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Inici\u00f3 el cultivo de Yuca y Malanga con un poquito de dinero que se gan\u00f3 trabajando como jornalero, y logr\u00f3 cultivar media manzana de tierra y esta le dio buen resultado, as\u00ed que dej\u00f3 de trabajar como jornalero para dedicarse a tiempo completo al cultivo. Su horario de trabajo comienza a las 6:00 am y culmina al mediodia y de vez en cuando sus hijos le ayudan con tareas que no son muy pesadas porque aun son peque\u00f1os y su esposa tambien lo hace pero se encarga mas de los quehaceres del hogar. Su ventaja es que los productos que cultiva son parte de la dieta alimenticia diaria y por eso son faciles de comercializar, su desventaja es que no cuenta con el suficiente dinero para incrementar el area de cultivo. El prestamo que Yonis solicita lo necesita para comprar urea, melaza, fungicidas y tambien para el pago de mano de obra por preparacion de la tierra a cultivar. Su meta es tecnificar su cultivo para asi convertirse en un gran productor y poder darle a su familia una mejor condicion de vida y que sus hijos sigan asistiendo a la escuela para que se hagan profesionales. Don Yonis tiene tres ciclos en FAMA y ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente, y eso le ha permitido obtener mas prestamos de mayores montos. ","en":"Yonis Marel is 34 years old.  He is a small-scale farmer of cassava and malanga (a native tuber).  He is married and has three children.  He lives together with his family in the community of La Concepcion, in the town of Patuca.  He started out growing cassava and malanga with a little money that he earned working as a laborer.  He managed to sow half a 'manzana' (one 'manzana' = 1.68 acres) of land and he obtained good results so he left his work as a laborer and started working full time on his farming.  His work day starts at 6.00am and ends at midday.  From time to time his children help him with some light tasks as they are still young.  His wife also does this but she mainly does the household chores.\r\n\r\nYonis' advantage is that the crops that he grows are part of people's daily diet and so they are easy to sell.  His disadvantage is that he doesn't have enough money to increase his growing area.  Yonis needs this loan to buy urea, molasses and fungicides, and also to pay laborers to prepare his land for sowing.  His goal is to apply technology to his farming so that he can become a big producer, provide his family with better living conditions and keep his children in school so that they can become professionals.\r\n\r\nYonis has been working with FAMA for three loan cycles and he has repaid his loans punctually.  This has allowed him to obtain subsequent loans of increasing size."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":853375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fungicides, fertilizers and molasses, and to pay laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yonis Marel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":12223.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476856}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T13:42:35Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":333263,"name":"Konana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Konana has been operating a \"boda boda\" motorbike for the past three years.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She lives with the father of her two children, seven-year-old Yasmin and three-year-old Estaban.  They live in the house of her in-laws for the time being.  Since she was a little girl, she has worked at planting and growing peas and potatoes because they have always been very profitable.  But even more, because she works with the support of her husband, she feels that these activities provide her with a lot of energy in her daily life.  At the same time, she decided three years ago to raise sheep with the objective of obtaining additional profits.  So she began with a couple of little lambs and then the quantity increased.   With the passage of years this activity is providing her with very good earnings because she sells them at a price of between 100 to 120 Sols on the hoof, depending on the size and weight.  To do this, she puts them out to pasture during the afternoon, but when she has to work in her fields she leaves each lamb tethered to a stake in such a way that it advances as it grazes.  \r\nThis is her ninth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  During the previous cycles, she has been punctual in her payments and so has won the confidence and respect of the other members of her communal bank, where she has been appointed treasurer and she has happily sworn to fulfill this responsibility.  She is planning on investing the money which she is requesting in the purchase of animals as well as in acquiring 10 bags of chemical fertilizer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":365227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy animals and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-08T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":507.86,"local_amount":1493.72,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1498.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959573},{"amount":342.14,"local_amount":1006.28,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992364}],"funded_date":"2009-08-08T16:54:48Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":131657,"name":"Dakila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dakila is 39-years old and a resident of Barangay Anguapan Tumauini, Isabela.

Ritchel\u2019s fondest hope is for her children to finish college and have good jobs or livelihoods when they grow up.\r\n\r\nRitchel realized early on that if they only relied on one source of income, she would probably not be able to fulfill her dreams for her children. She knew that she had the necessary skills to run a general store but she did not have the capital to even start one. When a friend informed her about how NWTF could help her, she immediately joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005.\r\n\r\nDetermined to make her new business a success, Ritchel worked hard to provide her customers with the items that they needed, and in the 4 years that she has been running the store, her monthly income has periodically increased.\r\n\r\nNow she earns about 24,000 PHP per month from her business activities which includes selling specialty products to her neighbors. Her income from her business activities has enabled her to have their house fixed.\r\n\r\nBecause she wants to pay her loans off in the shortest possible time, she has always borrowed on short terms. She used her previous loan of 19,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business. Maintaining her good credit performance, she paid off that loan within its loan term, and this has enabled her to borrow a bigger loan for the next cycle. \r\n\r\nShe is now borrowing 20,000 PHP for her 9th loan cycle so that she can sustain the inventory levels of her general store.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture, Ritchel is at the back of her general store, which is attached to her house, with empty bottles waiting for the delivery van to pick up and replenish.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":435463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional capital for her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T05:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ritchel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1538.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.69,"local_amount":1538,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849034},{"amount":98.08,"local_amount":4615.84,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4617.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739703},{"amount":130.77,"local_amount":6153.84,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6155.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129123},{"amount":130.77,"local_amount":6153.84,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":6155.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965919},{"amount":32.69,"local_amount":1538.48,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997831}],"funded_date":"2009-11-27T09:01:49Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Willard","image":null}},{"id":160546,"name":"Martha Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha Rosa A. de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Olocuilta en el departamento de La Paz, vive junto a su esposo el cual trabaja como carpintero y sus dos hijos menores de edad, los cuales se dedican a estudiar.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remedios has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000.00, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000.00 which she intends to use to buy more supplies of used clothes to sell so that she could continue to save up for future savings and expansion of her business. Remedios is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They got to know each other through their their husbands, neighbors and families.\r\nIn order to increase the size of their plots, they contacted Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first agricultural loan cycle. The group members are primarily going to grow groundnuts, millet and black-eyed peas.\r\nMrs. Dadi (sitting second from the left in the picture) intends to use her loan to buy one bag of urea fertilizer, 25 kilos groundnut seeds, one liter herbicide, and to recruit laborers to plow and weed in her fields. She gets her agricultural intrants from the fair in Tissala. Plowing and weeding is the work of the village's men. On her 5 acres of land, she counts on harvesting five bags of millet, twenty bags of groundnuts, two bags of black-eyed peas and their greens. Half of all the cultivated product is intended for sale, with the other half for family consumption. The profit is used to provide for the household's small expenses and for the children's support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":842498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy groundnut seeds, fertilizer, herbicide and to hire laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sirakorobougou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba   D ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayira    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayama  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00e2h       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dadi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"B\u00e2h     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama   M  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":490000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":490000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":490000,"processed_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-07T08:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":492118.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424606}],"funded_date":"2011-09-07T15:58:49Z","paid_date":"2012-05-07T08:21:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":329179,"name":"Mar\u00eda Trinidad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda es socia del banco comunal Loma de la Cruz, vive por la parroquia de Tarqui, este lugar es de clima fri\u00f3, propicio para la agricultura y para la ganader\u00eda por sus grandes llanuras.

She is a widow and mother of five children; three are studying, and the eldest is working while the youngest is still at home. By the grace of God, she has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Elvira, who believe that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nElvira operates a food and barbeque stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals on evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands (food items) cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElvira dreams for her children to find a stable job after finishing college and also for her business to grow more.

She owns & operates a business venture selling baked goods in the local community.  She has 4 years of experience in this business.  She needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make the products she sells.  She plans to use the profits from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Uini joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Uini's 1st loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

He works as a driver in a local company.  Cattle breeding is an additional source of income for Marat and his family.

In order to further increase the cattle numbers, Marat sought help from Bai Tushum & Partners and asked for a loan in the amount of KGS 130,000.  Marat will use the money from the loan to buy bull-calves for fattening and reselling.  He is planning to invest the income from the loan into the cattle raising.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She has done knitting work for three years, her decision to work independently is what pushed her to start her own business; she used to work as a domestic employee where the owner of the house taught her to knit all the types of stitches, it was a learning experience that now allows her to produce in great quantities shawls, caps, as well as bags and wallets.  Every two weeks she finishes knitting what she is going to sell and then travels to mining areas to sell her pieces, she also sells animals on weekends, which are kept at her in-law\u2019s house.  Marlene wants to get ahead and is thinking of opening a big store where she can sell all sorts of products including her knitting pieces and at the same time offer phone calls service because she has noted in the area where she lives there is a need for this service.  This is the second time that she gets a loan through MFP; she also likes to work with the community bank that she is currently part off because she learned to save money and work with a team.  The money requested is to be invested in the purchase of large quantities of wool to have supplies and boost production because during this time of year sales tend to increase.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She will use the loan to purchase feed for the growth of her hogs.  She is also planning to venture into fresh meat vending. She used to sell pork meat in kilos in their village. Sometimes, Elvie sold the product on a cash basis but most of the time, her customers would pay after a week. She is hoping for her dreams to come true to be able to support also the needs of her three children who are currently studying hard, aiming to uplift their standard of living someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":373635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

B. is from the village of Lodiong Tambulig,Zamboanga del Sur. She is 35 years old. Ruth is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Ruth owns & operates a \"sari-sari\" retail store selling daily use products and dried goods in the local community. Ruth has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ruth is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Ruth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and save as a reserve for future needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":404661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married to Roger F., who works as security personnel, and is the mother of a high-school-aged child. By the grace of God, Elena has managed to support her child\u2019s schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her child all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Elena, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMa. Elena operates a variety store. She also rents out a few rooms for transients and students. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for buying one sachet of shampoo, one egg or 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil. Juanita earns by getting supplies at a wholesale price and selling in piece rate. Elena\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $4.50 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

Her husband, Jose G., 60, works as a Winsman Operator to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children ranging in age from 22 to 37 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nThelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to purchase more stocks to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Thelma G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

He lives in his family's house with his sister and mother in a humble neighborhood in the Tuman district in the north of Peru.  He earns a living working in a business that harvests and processes sugar cane.  He has worked for one year in this business.  Currently, his home is in a somewhat deteriorated condition.  He would like to make some improvements to the home and buy some furniture.  He would like to make his home more comfortable.  In order to do so, he is requesting a $200 loan from Edpyme Alternative.

Jose Street, Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Ramon L., an employee, and is the mother of three children, two of whom are already working, while the other one is still in school. By the grace of God, Elizabeth has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send the rest of her children all the way through college, which is a dream for most Filipino parents like Helen, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has managed her own beauty salon for quite some time now. She is an all-around beautician and runs a small beauty salon in the comfort of her home. Upon the request of customers, she also provides home service, doing manicures, pedicures, haircuts, hairdressing and make-up. She also sells cosmetics offered by direct-selling companies like Avon and Sara Lee. Monthly, Elizabeth earns an estimated net income of around 12,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 48,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more supplies and new equipment needed for her salon operation. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes that her business will continue to grow and she will be able to send her youngest child to college.  She prays for good health and to be able to enjoy a peaceful life with her family. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

the local community. She needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fetu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Fetu's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":934909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is very strong-willed and resolute. Her hard work, perseverance and ability to offer a wide assortment of clothing have helped her keep loyal clientele and expand her business. Presently, Svitlana has about $2,000 of working capital. \r\n\r\nSvitlana is requesting a loan of $800 to allow her to increase her inventory and to help open a new vending kiosk in another local market. She can purchase men and women\u2019s clothing in bulk for good prices. If she is able to open a second sales kiosk, her sales activity will increase greatly and she will be able to meet the needs of more customers.  This loan will give Svitlana a chance to expand her trade, increase profits, and invest in her business and her family\u2019s future welfare.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\nThe successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The group members live in large traditional extended families in the village of Paridara on the banks of the river (S\u00e9gou region, Republic of Mali).  They know one another through ties of community and kinship, and they do almost the same work, selling shea nut butter and <i>secco<\/i> butter.  The women are in high demand in this business of theirs.\r\n<p>\r\nTo satisfy the ever-growing needs of their customers, the group members decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are on their first solidarity loan (group loan).  \r\n<p>\r\nThey intend to use this loan to buy and store shea nut butter and <i>seccos<\/i> that they buy with their husbands, who process it.  The <i>seccos<\/i> are sold in retail cash transactions on the riverbank in Paridara (where there is no marketplace).  As for the shea nut butter, it\u2019s sold at the house and at the San marketplace.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average profit of 35,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":296642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy shea nut butter and \"secco\"      ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saniya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bibia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Besou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tres\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronique ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"B\u00e9atrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033765},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621137},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:01Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020100},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242854},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678493},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678495}],"funded_date":"2009-04-04T17:59:39Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":102993,"name":"Battulga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Battulga T. lives with his wife and daughter in the Baganuur district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

The money he needs will be used to buy chemical fertilizers for his crops.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T03:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilder","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2009,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886540}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T17:36:21Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":156439,"name":"Gloria Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria Petrona tiene 57 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy luchadora y le gusta muchos su trabajo.

He is separated but he has 5 grown children who, like him, work in construction. When he was very young he learned the trade of bricklayer.  At first he only watched, but when he was sure nothing stopped him from this work.  He is currently a construction foreman, that is to say one who hires for a construction project and brings his team of bricklayers, which he leads with his experience until the work is finished.  He is passionate about his work, since he has a lot of work and has good earnings.  In addition, it is a trade that he passed on to his children, who have already formed their own families and are supporting themselves with their work in construction, like their father did.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of his age, Abraham is a man who has a strong desire to get ahead and who has many plans for the future, such as building a construction company with his own vehicle and cement mixer.  In this way he would be able to hire for large projects and would earn much more money.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP, and he assures us that he will be very punctual with each of his payments, so that he can continue to advance.  With the money that he requests he will buy a drill and other tools that he needs that will help him to do his job better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva
