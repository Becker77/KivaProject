They live in their own house, with the basic necessities.  They have 3  children, two sons and one girl, all teenagers who study at the public school.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Alba has been the owner of a small general store for more than 5 years.  She sells items for every day use such as rice, oil, drinks, flour, etc.   She runs her business from her home, and her children help her.   Her husband has worked for the railroads for more than 20 years and has a monthly salary which helps cover the costs of taking care of and educating the children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> The motivation for requesting a loan is to be able to purchase more merchandise to stock the business, such as ciders, wines, beer, soft drinks, etc.  because the demand for these items is always high at the end of the year.  One of the projects Alba has for next year is to open another business, selling clothing, items for the home, office, gifts, etc.   There is currently no such shop in the neighborhood and her customers are requesting it. <\/p>\r\n\r\nDescripci\u00f3n:\tDESCRIPCION necesidad \r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Alba M. de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada con el se\u00f1or Valent\u00edn C\u00e1ceres de 41 a\u00f1os, viven en casa propia, equipada con las necesidades b\u00e1sicas del hogar. Tienen tres hijos a\u00fan menores de edad, dos son varones y una mujer; todos ellos son adolescentes y est\u00e1n estudiando en colegios p\u00fablicos.<p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Alba es propietaria de una despensa con m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad, vende art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como ser arroz, aceite, bebidas en general, harina, etc., su  negocio lo tiene en su propia casa, que es atendida por ella y por sus hijos. Su marido trabaja como empleado ferroviario hace m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os y tiene un salario mensual, con la que ayuda a cubrir los gastos de alimentaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n de sus tres hijos. <p>\r\n\r\nEl motivo por el cual solicitan el cr\u00e9dito es para la compra de mercader\u00edas en oferta como ser: vinos, sidras, cervezas, golosinas, productos enlatados, etc. ya que en \u00e9pocas de fin de a\u00f1o la demanda de estos art\u00edculos es bastante alta. <p>\r\n\r\nUno de los proyectos de Alba para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o es la de abrir otro negocio, esta ser\u00e1 en el ramo de mercer\u00eda y bazar (venta de art\u00edculos varios como ropa, art\u00edculos para la casa, librer\u00eda, regalos, etc.). ya que   en el barrio no existe ning\u00fan comercio dedicado a esos rubros

Although she ran the store off and on for a while, it has been her only business since February 2002. Since then, she has dedicated herself full time to the store and to her parents. In fact, not only has Lourdes opened a second store in another neighbourhood, with her sister and neighbour helping her run it, she has also bought a photocopier and three computers to help turn the first store into a cyber cafe as well as a stationer's. Little by little, her business is growing. \r\nLourdes needs a loan of $12,000 pesos, which she will pay back in 10 installments, so that she can buy stationary to sell. She is short on capital at the moment. Because of the money she spent on the computers, she does not have enough left over for merchandise. \r\n. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

building materials for continued construction of his house. He liked Microinvest's loan conditions, and since he has a business he decided to request a loan for its development. Abdufatto is 51 years old, married, and has five children. His business is in the city's top restaurant, where he rents the bar. Two people work at the bar (the vendor is in the picture). Abdufatto hopes that the loan will allow him to further develop the business, and that he will be able to continue to receive loans in the future. \r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian

The mash is placed in a non-water proof bag and allowed to ferment for one or two days, while weights are placed on the bag to press the water out. It is then sieved (or sifted) and roasted by heating in a bowl. The resulting dry granular garri can be stored for long periods. It may be pounded or ground to make a fine flour.

This bank is located in the city of Cuenca in the southern part of the country in the Sierro Centro region.\r\n\r\nRosario Q. is a member of the Damas Responsible Communal Bank.  She lives in the Catamarca sector in the city of Cuenca.  She is 69, married, and has six children.  She does not remember the ages of each one of them.  All of her children are married and living independently with their families.  She only lives with her husband, who is retired from the electric company, and a grandson.  Their house, which is their own, is the fruit of their mutual work in their youth.\r\n\r\nRosario works in agriculture, and she also raises animals.  She has been doing this for many years, and it supports her.  She has been working with her communal bank for three years.  She feels satisfaction for what she has achieved from buying seeds for her crops to paying the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she will receive from the ESPOIR Foundation to fix her house; she wants to put on a roof.  She will also buy corn, lima bean, and kidney bean, etc., seeds to increase her crops.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her health and her life to keep working with her crops and her animals.  She wants to keep increasing her business for her old age when she will not be able to work.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Sulaimon is 39 years old. He is married and is the father of 6 children. Sulaimon lives in Shahristan, Tajikistan. He grows and sells vegetables, such as potatoes, onions and carrots. Since the income generated by his work is always meager, he would like to use this loan from Kiva to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer to increase the productivity of his farm. This will allow him to earn a better return on his investment. The profits from his business will enable him to pay for household needs. Sulaimon and his family sincerely thank you for you support and encouragement. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 37 years old and has worked for three years as a repairman.  He used to do the same job before but the hours were brutal and, worn out, he resigned.  With a payment that he then received, he bought supplies of clothes and cosmetics and began working as a street vendor, his sales being his sole source of income.  His wife has had three children, all now in elementary school, and what Armando most wants is to give them a good education.  He decided to go back to work as a repairman after some years because his sales were often too little to justify his hard work and the terrible hours he had to work before have improved.  \r\n\r\nHe will use this loan to improve his house.

Fredy lives with \u00c1ngela, 26, and they have two children.  They live in their own home made from flimsy materials. \r\n\r\nWith much effort, Fredy managed to turn his fields into green areas surrounded by lush trees and planted with cocoa bean, coffee and citrus fruits.

Today, he works his own lands.\r\n\r\nHis most profitable crop is the citrus fruits because he sells them at wholesale and retail at a very good price.  Thanks to profits earned he succeeded in setting up a grocery store where his wife, \u00c1ngela, works.  The months from June to August are the months when the greatest variety of planting takes place which is why Fredy has called upon the financial institution to negotiate a loan that will make it possible for him to plant more oranges and mandarins.

key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells used clothing, a business she has been involved with for the past 16 years and which earns her funds with which to help pay household expenses.  She began with her own savings as well as loans that have allowed her to maintain her sales.  This is her 8th cycle with Afodenic and she intends to use these funds to buy wholesale bales of used clothing as well as school uniforms since Nicaragua's national holiday is fast approaching and this is when parents traditionally purchase school uniforms.  She hopes to have her own store and thanks the institution for the growth attained to date which has allowed her to keep her client base and earn profits that have helped her meet her personal needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":374642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase school uniforms and bales of used clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.53,"local_amount":2670.53,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2733.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875854},{"amount":33.14,"local_amount":662.81,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":678.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713774},{"amount":284.26,"local_amount":5685.24,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5819.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601468},{"amount":148.13,"local_amount":2962.63,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002922},{"amount":175.43,"local_amount":3508.6,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3591.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841077},{"amount":225.51,"local_amount":4510.19,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873987}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T13:07:12Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":135444,"name":"Help Yourself #2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Help Yourself #2 is a group of five borrowers who live in Kolahu, Lofa County, Liberia.

She is married to Antonio R. and both are blessed with two children. Born in the province of Masbate, a province just South of Manilas, he now lives in Dasmarinas, Cavite together with her family.\r\n\r\nRiza has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow  seven times in the CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used all most all the money she loaned to buy and sell various personal products and office supplies to her clients.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying additional stock and as payment for the monthly amortization of their motorized tricycle.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that when the time comes, they will have the resources to send their children to college. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":439375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Raul is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land he works is his own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Raul feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Raul and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Raul is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Raul and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Raul, with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Raul planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Raul and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Raul, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Raul wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":618248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of agricultural nutrients and chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T20:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98352.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99991.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101656.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.97,"local_amount":40984.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":41697.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970540},{"amount":53.95,"local_amount":26973.7,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":27443.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158221},{"amount":464.08,"local_amount":232042.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":236079.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614327}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T15:58:25Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242795,"name":"Shafiqullah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shafiqullah is son of F.

is a widow and 32 years old with 3 children.\r\n\r\nAnnie owns and operates a business venture, selling chips.  She has 2 years of experience in this business. Annie needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her loan to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Annie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Annie's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She is married and the mother of two children, one of whom is in school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel for five years. Palm oil is produced from palm nut fruits, and the palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil, which is produced first. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil. \r\n\r\nGifty produces and supplies her product to food vendors, who use it to prepare their meals. She even treks to the villages to purchase the finished goods when demand is very high.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Telesia needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 220 talas or $92 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Telesia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

In her spare time she cares for her animals and supports herself in this way.  She has trouble with the droughts and frost during the last harvest and it affected production.  Each year they raise potatoes, onions, carrots, and corn.  The corn is good for feed for their cattle; however it was damaged by the drought and is completely dry.\r\n\r\nDaria is well liked and respected in her community because of her dedication to farming and the quality of the products she sells.  She and her husband are alone now that their children have gone to different parts of the country.  They are asking for this loan to buy supplies such as potato seed, onion seed, chemicals, and compost.  In this way they can improve their production.  The small plots they own are not enough, so they rent land so they can expand production.  She also has the idea of improving her quality of life with the help of this loan.  In the future she will use loans to invest in things that will make her business more efficient.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1276660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy farming supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2666.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.66},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She lives with her only son, Yeron who is 6 years old, to whom she wants to give a good education. For Mirian, bees, instead of scaring her, cause her happiness as thanks to the honey that they produce she can bring home to her family the money necessary to support her household. She has been involved in this activity for 4 years and the honey that she sells is quickly purchased by the stores to which she supplies this delicious nectar. Mirian enjoys her work as when she is hungry she does not hesitate to open some of her plastic containers and taste the product that she sells.  But what she likes least is having to walk so much during the day to sell her product.  Despite this she knows that she has to work hard and hopes to be able to open a more stable business such as a grocery store or a bookstore as the neighborhood where she lives is new and still lacks these services.  This is her second loan with MFP and she knows that she has to pay it on time and feels the responsibility to do it.  In her communal bank she acts with solidarity and concern.   With the funds that she is requesting she plans to increase her working capital and purchase more honey to be able to have the money necessary to open her own business that see so much wants.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":305650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":285}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.55,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":284.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012470},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":284.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596060},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":284.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990324},{"amount":91.57,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":284.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211447},{"amount":91.56,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":284.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640950},{"amount":92.2,"local_amount":285,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":286.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080418}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T21:41:55Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":106765,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulina A. is thirty years old.

been making loans for several years. The women in the Bank are very thankful because through these loans they have been able to better themselves and provide a better life for their families. They are very proud of their achievements. As a group, they are very cheerful and extroverted and get along very well with one another. <p>\r\n\r\nLuz lives in the North Pan American Highway (km. 7 1\/2), about 40 minutes outside the city of Cuenca. She is 32 years old, is married, and even though she currently has no kids she plans to have them soon. Luz and her husband live in a house they own and her husband works as a driver. They have a stable and loving relationship.\r\n<p>\r\nLuz studied Beauty and makes a living in this field. She has had her own business for 6 years and is doing very well because she has a good customer base. The greatest advantage of owning her own salon is that she can work peacefully and independently.

In this way Lucilda receives the requests by telephone and her oldest son distributes the tanks on his motorbike. Lucilda is very happy now that her business is making money and growing. It is because of this that she wants to increase the room that she has to store the tanks.

She is 50 years old. Erlinda is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 24 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Erlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Erlinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

She worked very hard at several activities just to have her own income to augment that of her husband, a fisherman. Looking back on how she painfully started her life being a mother and a wife, she has learned that getting away from poverty was never easy. However, the determination she saw in her children to attain a higher level of education and finish college gives her courage and strength to combat poverty. With the help she has found in ASHI, KIVA's field partner in the Philippines, she is certain that she will change her family\u2019s standard of living in the near future. \r\n<p>\r\nGemma believes that in scrap and junk there is wealth. Aside from her desire to help her community maintain the cleanliness of its surroundings, Gemma also wants people to realize the value of maximizing things that they thought were useless in earning money. Therefore, she thought of putting up a business buying and selling scrap and junk. Empty plastic bottles, cans, used papers and metals are examples of things she buys from people and sells to a junk shop. For two years now, this business has been Gemma\u2019s great financial provider. Someday, she really hopes to put up her own junk shop and to increase the proceeds from it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":444102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Immediately after the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which would go on to completely destroy the town of Goma in 2002, Noella started a business with her own funds selling used clothes, running the same type of business as her husband. She displays her goods at the central market in Virunga. This new loan should serve to supply her stock with one bale of (used) clothing, with the remainder being used to pay for her children's school expenses and to build up some savings for a safety net.

She sells delicious and hygienically-prepared tortillas.  She has been selling tortillas for many years and so she is very well known in the area.  Her customers are loyal to her business because she provides a good service, prepares her tortillas hygienically and sells them at a good price.\r\n\r\nLeticia is a tenacious and entrepreneurial woman.  Every day she asks herself how she can improve her income so that she can provide her family with a better quality of life.  She has decided to expand her business and start offering her customers not only tortillas but also drinks such as water and juice.  In this way, she hopes to attract more customers which will enable her to improve her income.  She had the idea of requesting a loan from INTEGRAL so that she could buy a variety of drinks and invest in her tortilla business.  Leticia has a lot of faith that the decision she has taken will prove successful and that her living conditions will gradually change for the better."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":793602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been married to her husband Gerardo for 33 years and the couple had seven children.  One of their children died and they now live together with three of them in their own home which is located in the small village of Punray.\r\n\r\nVictoria always has a smile on her face.  She starts each day in this cheerful way.  Victoria's business is buying and selling all kinds of meat.  She sells her meat to the people who live in Huacuas area and has regular customers there.  Her customers also ask her for all kinds of clothes.  Victoria therefore bought merchandise in the capital city to re-sell.  This makes her good profits as the area is quite remote and there aren't many stores.  She makes the most of the fact that the place is cold and knits skirts and sweaters.  She also sells these.  Victoria really enjoys her business and hopes to save up enough money to open a store equipped with things that people in this Andean region need.  She confesses that her hobby is agriculture.  She sows peas on her plot of land but only in small quantities.  \"I mustn't lose the habit\" she says.\r\n\r\nVictoria is a member of the \"Punray Avanzando\" community bank and this is her ninth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your support so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments.

Their marriage has given Delma and her husband three children, who they have worked to help progress. Two of the children are of school age, and the oldest helps out in the business.<p>\r\n\r\nApproximatly four years ago Delma had to leave behind her life of working only as a housewife, and open a business in the Isreal Lewites market in the city of Managua. It was not easy for her in the beginning, as she hadn't yet learned to deal in plastics. Nevertheless, she took the risk for the well being of her family. She began with $800 in capital. Her location is not very well placed, as she must take her products out to display them.<p>\r\n\r\nShe came up with the idea of opening her business as the need arose to pay bills and to pay for things that her husband's small salary didn't cover. Currently, Delma sells about $80.00 in product per day. Thanks to CEPRODEL, she has been able to improve the infrastructure of her location, and purchase more merchandise. She has been working with CEPRODEL for 2 years, and has a history of 9 loans.<p>\r\n <p><b>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDelma Eugenia es propietaria de su negocio, ama de casa, madre incondicional y esposa dedicada.

Now, Gloria works on her guinea pig farm (guinea pigs are considered a delicacy in Peru). The farm used to belong to Gloria\u2019s mother, who left it to her. Gloria now has her own home on the farm, where she is raising about 150 guinea pigs.

Antoinette M. is requesting her first loan from Vision Finance Company.  She has owned a small shop in the Gasabo district of the capital city for ten years.  Each day she works from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm which allows her to earn a profit of approximately 100,000 Rwandan Francs each month ($200 USD).  She has two employees who help her run the shop.  \r\n\r\nAntoinette is requesting a loan of 500,000 Rwandan Francs to be paid back over a period of eight months.

Having repaid three loans punctually, she is asking for a fourth loan to increase her working capital in order to buy six 100kg bags of shea nuts and two 100kg bags of potatoes. She stocks up in the town of Kadiolo on fair days and often in the surrounding villages. The nuts are firstly made into shea butter before being sold on. Her products are sold wholesale for cash at home and at the market in Kadiolo on fair days to customers who are mainly fairground workers (Sikassois). With this loan she plans to make an average monthly profit of 19,000 FCFA which will be used principally to increase her working capital and pay the interest on her loan; she will save anything that is left.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":444127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of shea nuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-09T08:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anchata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25777.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763610},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25777.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152445},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25777.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991286},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-19T10:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25777.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021557},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":25777.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746352},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":25777.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778898}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T12:35:02Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":164402,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth, age 43, sells sarongs, laces, and bags at retail prices to her customers in Warri, Delta State, Nigeria, where she lives.

His parcel has the following crops: coca leaf, coffee plants and cocoa bean plants all of which are plants native to the Apurimac River Valley. \r\n\r\nDuring harvest season he needs extra help and must hire day laborers in order to pick the fruit.  What he most likes about his work is harvesting because that\u2019s when he sees the months of hard work rewarded in the quality of his fruits.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is Nuru K..  She is 30 years old, married, and has four children. In addition, she has one dependent who lives with her because he is in school and his parents live in a remote area. In 2007, Nuru established her market stall business. Working six days a week, and 9 to 12 hours a day, she earns about $160 each month from this business. She is assisted by her hursband and two employees. <P>\r\nNuru has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase beans, nuts, and onions in bulk for her market stall. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately $45. <P>\r\nIn the future, Nuru plans to diversify her business. For example, she would like to start a charcoal-selling business: these small, black, dirty pieces of dry earth are important to the people of Tanzania because they rely on charcoal to cook meals. Indeed, many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them.

Already in her second year of participation with the Fund, she finds that the loan repayment terms are very agreeable and convenient for her family.
