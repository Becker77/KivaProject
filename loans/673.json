quarter in Bamenda, Cameroon. M. runs a small tailoring workshop with her husband in the Nkwen market. With this loan, she plans to buy more material for sewing. She also plans to do marking (embroidery) of dresses and clothing. Her business plan shows she will invest 10,000 CFA (approximately $20 USD) of her own savings as well.  \r\n \r\nThis will be M.'s third loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2006. She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main road), the quality of her products, and her reasonable prices. She buys in bulk which causes the price to be minimal and sews things herself with the help of her husband. She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n \r\nPart of the profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of M.'s children. And the other part will be used for medication and food for her large family. M. does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments, every two weeks.  \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

C. sells popular consumable goods.  She has a small grocery store that is located in the neighbourhood of Trozos. Since she established her own business, it has grown also and has helped with the household expenses.  It is very clear that her business is very good: her store is located in an area where there are very few grocery stores and as a result she doesn't have much competition and this is the her business' secret.  The area where she lives is an area with very few economic resources and the majority of the population are very poor people, which means that she has to sell her products at very low prices in order to make sufficient sales.

She is 36 years old and lives with her partner and their three children. Two of her children are adolescents, while the youngest is just a year and a half old. Maria Mercedes works on her family farm, where she has been growing yucca and bananas for the past eight or nine years. After harvesting the crops, she sells them at the local market. Though Pilcopata is a very small town and consists of little more than a few blocks of houses and stores along a dirt road, its market is quite new and modern. Pilcopata receives a lot of traffic, since all travelers coming to surrounding towns come into Pilcopata first by bus. \r\n\r\nMaria Mercedes is requesting a loan of 2000 soles. She will use most of the loan money to pay her field hands. She usually employs two to three people during harvest time, and pays each worker 25 soles per day.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The group is comprised of 13 members with low incomes.  They are very hard-working and have the expectation of achieving more income.  The women have had a friendship for a long time; they know each other through their businesses and as neighbors.  \r\n\r\nThey work in different types of commercial activities like a grocery store, selling bread, cakes, cell phones, shoes, cosmetics, and making articles of clothing.  Some have fixed stands and others are street vendors.  If they have competitors, the members have the ability to move their stands and to diversity their merchandise to be able to get a daily income to support their families.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy merchandise, supplies, and tools to help them improve their daily income.  For example, getting an electric sewing machine would really help Silvie to deliver her work more quickly.  This would improve her daily income to support her children.  She would be able to give them everything she always dreamed about, a better education and a better future for the whole family.\r\n\r\nAs far as their loan experience goes, the members are in their fourth cycle.  They show a great desire to keep growing, honesty, and responsibility in their payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Mrs. Bernarda owns a food business, which she started three years ago in order to help support her family. Even though the business is not very old, she has 26 years of experience selling food. Her mother taught her at a very young age that she had to learn to earn a living and would send her out to the street to sell tortillas and sometimes bread. She has asked for the loan in order to buy a large enough supply of staple grains to avoid the price fluctuations of these items.

He lives in his own house in the Dallan neighborhood, San prefecture. He has been in the buisness of selling cereal for 30 years now, and he has been working for himself at the grand market of San for 20 years. Amadou is very much in demand during the weekly fairs in San and the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nTo increase his business, he decided to turn to micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. He is on his third personal loan. Mr. Amadou K. plans to buy 4 tons of husked rice, 2 tons of pearl millet, 3.5 tons of millet and 2 tons of beans. He obtains his supplies from the wholesalers in San, but with this increase in his capital, he plans to buy directly from the producers. \r\n\r\nHe sells everyday at the  grand market in San and at the weekly fairs to customers who are both men and women, on credit  or in cash. He hopes to make a monthly profit of 130,000 CFA francs which he plans to use to repay the loan, pay for his children's schooling, buy food and and invest the rest in other income-producing activities. His goal is to ask for a bigger loan which will allow him to expand his business, increase his turnover and improve his quality of life.

They have three children who are 8 to 20 years old. One of the children has his own family and the other two are currently going to school. Annabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to pirchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and future family needs. Annabelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Y. lives in the Vakhsh area. He is 56 years old and has a university degree in economics. He lives with his wife and child.  He has a small and close family. Abdulhay buys and re-sells calves. He keeps the calves for some time to fatten up and then re-sells them. The profits from this business support his family. Abdulhay would like to expand the business to sell more calves. Expanding his business will also result in more good quality meat being available at the local market. In order to expand he needs financial help and so has requested a loan.  Abdulhay plans to repay the loan in 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p\r\n\r\n\r\n\u042e\u0441\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432

When they had enough money saved up, they bought a car to transport their products.

Among her dreams are to have her own store (but that would require a large 7,000 dollar loan), to buy and work a motocar, and to buy a small car.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":252153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy toys and sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-10T02:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":215.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215419},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":215.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397128},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":215.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088802},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":215.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982158}],"funded_date":"2009-01-10T15:47:07Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:01:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":86801,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicia O. is 55 years old and married with 5 children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Levantado. Cayo Levantado is a small island located off of the Samana Peninsula, which is located on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. Even though the island is isolated, it still has one of the most beautiful beaches near the coast. Due to its beauty and location, thousands of tourists flock to the island yearly.\r\n<p>\r\nThe popularity of the island with tourists was one of the reasons Augustin decided to open a jewelery business. He sells local designs of both gold and silver to tourists. Augustin\u2019s third loan with Esperanza is indicative of his success and hard work. He has an excellent record of loan repayment, and with his next loan he hopes to expand his business even further.\r\n<p>\r\nAs always, one of Augustin\u2019s major goals is to continue his business growth. He and his wife have four children, and the main reason for his continual desire to grow the business is to continue to help his family out in any way possible. One of the major reasons he believes his business has been able to continue to grow is that over the years he has picked up the English language, allowing him to reach an even larger market. Learning English is a true testament to his business ingenuity that has allowed him run a successful business in the past, and he hopes to continue this optimism into the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":346137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To increase inventory for retail","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Saman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augustin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2890.39},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2899.9},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2904.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2909.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2914.22},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2919.01},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2923.81},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2928.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2933.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2938.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2943.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.85},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.58,"local_amount":2890.39,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2951.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168354},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":2895.14,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2956.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73593615},{"amount":82.85,"local_amount":2899.9,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:15:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028960},{"amount":82.99,"local_amount":2904.66,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2966.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96940987},{"amount":83.13,"local_amount":2909.44,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2971.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103782391},{"amount":83.26,"local_amount":2914.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2976.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110671459},{"amount":83.4,"local_amount":2919.01,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2980.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118067160},{"amount":419.07,"local_amount":14667.24,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14978.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128937144}],"funded_date":"2009-07-04T04:21:47Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:48:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":123665,"name":"Queen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Queen E. sells provisions.

She is married and has two adult children.  Simith has been a seamstress for 20 years.  Bit by bit she produced her own income and, saving her money to equip her small sewing shop and having the skills to engage in this kind of work, she did not hesitate to do so and, thanks to support from the Manuela Ramos Movement, managed to set it up in her own home in a space adapted to take care of customers.  She tells us that her sales are good; she works on order.  She is still engaged in this work and she has regular customers that come by her house daily to place their orders.  She, herself, takes care of them with the kindness that so characterizes her.  With this 3000 sol loan she will buy lengths of various kinds of fabric and tools like scissors, sewing needles (both manual and machine), pins, and buttons.  Simith feels very fulfilled with a still stronger desire to succeed and see her dreams come true.

a\u00f1os. Cr\u00eda aves de corral y cerdos en la parte posterior de su vivienda, los engorda para luego comercializarlos con los negociantes que frecuentan la zona. Aurelia nos comenta que tambi\u00e9n cr\u00eda vacas con el mismo fin pero que las cr\u00eda en un terreno que posee en las afueras del distrito. Esta actividad se ha convertido en el principal ingreso econ\u00f3mico con el cual sostiene los gastos familiares y cuida de su madre, que es de edad avanzada.\n\nAurelia desea mejorar la alimentaci\u00f3n de los animales que cr\u00eda con la finalidad de obtener mayores ganancias, por ello se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 700 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de alimento balanceado.\n\nElla es una mujer trabajadora y que ha luchado por salir adelante a pesar de su condici\u00f3n de madre soltera, sus vecinos y conocidos la estiman mucho y la consideran una persona de confianza.

She\u2019s a single mother of three children, two of whom are independent.  She lives with her youngest daughter in her mother\u2019s house, which is in Za\u00f1a district, 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has raised animals for 20 years.  She raises barnyard fowl and pigs in her back yard.  She fattens them up and then sells to merchants that visit the area.  Aurelia tells us that she also raises cows with the same goal in mind but she raises them on property that she has on the outskirts of the district.  This activity has become her main source of income with which she supports her family and cares for her mother, who is getting on in years.\r\n\r\nAurelia would like to improve the nutrition of her animals so that they will produce higher profits at sale time.  With this in mind, she finds herself in need of calling upon Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to request a 700 new sol loan to buy nutritionally balanced animal feed.\r\n\r\nShe is a hard-working woman who has struggled to get ahead despite being a single mother.  Her neighbors and acquaintances hold her in high regard and consider her to be a trustworthy person.

The members of the Djekafo group live in large, traditional families. They got to know each other in the neighborhood. On average, they are 45 years old and have seven children. They have been working with Soro Yiriwaso for more than four years and are requesting their ninth group loan. \r\n\r\nTheir business involves the sale of various items such as food condiments and also a restaurant. Batoma C., who is often called Batoma Bakounkolo (goat head) because her restaurant features sheep and goat heads and feet, plans to use her loan to buy base products and ingredients for her restaurant. Each day she buys twelve heads of sheep and goats, 1 kg of onions, a basket of tomatoes and other small condiments. She restocks and then sells daily at the San market to a diverse customer base. Batoma expects to earn 56 000 XOF, while the other members of the group expect to earn 48 000 XOF per month. Their earnings will be used not only to repay the loan, but also to help their spouses and re-invest in the business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joanne Archambault, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":534832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of ingredients for the restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-04T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Batoma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madeleine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":875000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":145833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":145833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":145833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":145833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":145833.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":146646.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779274},{"amount":295.84,"local_amount":145833.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":146646.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961487},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":145833.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":146646.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699607},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":145833.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":146646.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913494},{"amount":295.84,"local_amount":145833.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":146646.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180659},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":145833.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":146646.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476630}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T09:43:21Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":202367,"name":"Kol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kol O., 39, is married and lives with her husband and two children in Takeo Province, Cambodia, an area known for pre-Angkorean temples.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Also, their town is called San Miguel Tepelcingo.  It is a very beautiful town where everybody speaks the indigenous language and most of the women work making napkins and tablecloths.  This group is made up of 15 very hard-working women who embroider tablecloths and napkins.\r\n\r\nThis group's representative is 39 year-old Herlinda A. L\u00f3pez who is married to Mart\u00edn Barrag\u00e1n Mejia who works in agriculture.  They have three children.  Herlinda's business is embroidering tablecloths.

It takes her several days to make each of these products.  She tells us that lately her business has been doing very well.  In order to sell her products, Ver\u00f3nica must travel to Pinotepa Nacional where she sells them in the market.  This is one hour away from her town.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica has been engaged in this business activity for 8 years.  She inherited it from her mom since it is a technique that is passed down from generation to generation.  Ver\u00f3nica dreams that her children will become professionals so that they will have better opportunities in life.  She would also like to see her products sell internationally since they are beautiful handicrafts that are made with a lot of effort and dedication.  Ver\u00f3nica uses the profits that she makes on her products to provide her family with money since her husband's income does not stretch far enough.  As he works in agriculture, they don't make much money and sometimes there is only enough money for food.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a al Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  con el fin de comprar materias primas, e insumos en diversos colores y texturas, en mayor volumen, para obtener descuentos y adaptarse a los requerimientos que tiene su clientela con respecto a la moda. Desde muy ni\u00f1a Nelys aprendi\u00f3 de su t\u00eda el arte de la confecci\u00f3n y cuando estuvo adulta eligi\u00f3 esta actividad como su trabajo principal, compr\u00f3 su primera m\u00e1quina y desde entonces no ha parado.

She sells women's clothes, bedspreads and table mats to a customer base which is made up of neighbors, family members and people who she has been recommended to.  They increasingly make more demands for quality products and expect better prices.  This makes Nelys very excited and awakens her creativity even more.  Her big challenge is ensuring that her working capital stretches far enough to allow her to respond to her customers in a timely fashion as she sells most of her products on credit.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan - her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo - to buy raw materials and supplies, in different colors and textures.  She will buy in larger volumes so that she can obtain discounts and adapt to her customers' needs with respect to fashion.\r\n\r\nNelys learned the art of dressmaking from her aunt when she was very young and, when she grew up, she chose this as her main business activity.  She bought her first machine and since then she hasn't stopped.  Now, at 54 years old, she feels very happy to have made this decision because, over the years, she has managed to capture a very profitable market and people recommend her to other customers.  She is currently starting a new line of products, making hammocks, which are currently very much in fashion.

Even though she doesn't have a store, she uses a small space in her house with a window to store and exhibit her products. She enjoys her job because she knows many people and continues to build friendships. In fact, her clients consistently refer other clients to her, so her client base (and therefore monthly orders) continue to increase. In the future, Gladys hopes to own a clothing store.

It was very hard to get over the death of her husband.  She sells cold drinks everyday.  Her work starts early in the day at 5:30 in the morning.  She gets up in order to start boiling the water she uses to make her delicious drinks.  The drinks are cinnamon, apple, peach and other kinds, depending on the season.  She has been selling for quite a while, since the market\u2019s infrastructure was almost all dirt.  She is respected and known to the passers-by.  \r\n\r\nHaving considerable sales during the day, she ends her day happily because this is her only source of income to support her family.\r\n\r\nThe

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

L. is a member of the group \"CUANICUTI\".  They named their group after some condominiums in their area and this is where they will hold their weekly meetings.  She is very proud to be a member of this group as she is the representative.  Do\u00f1a Fabiola is originally from Naucalpan de Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico state.  Because of family matters, she came with her parents to live in Zitacuaro Michoac\u00e1n 20 years ago.  She is 30 years old and studied social work.  She says that she is not working in her professional field because she got married and decided to dedicate her time to her family.  Do\u00f1a Fabi, as her friends and family call her, sells catalog products and also works as a sales coordinator for a cosmetics company.  She has worked at this job for more than 4 years.   She started selling catalog products because, when she was a young girl, she used to help her mother sell catalog products.  She also helps her husband sell and maintain copiers as well as selling copier cartridges, toner and stationary.  She says that she has approximately 10 years of experience in the copier business and that her husband, Se\u00f1or Uriel, was the one who taught her this business.  He runs this small business out of their home, saving on rent. They have a daughter named Melanie who is 8 years old and attends elementary school.  Se\u00f1ora Fabiola says that her goal is to have a fixed location where she can sell cosmetics and other catalog products and move the copier business there.    She says that she will save the earnings from her catalog and copier sales to purchase a piece of land where she can have the commercial site that she dreams of. \r\n\r\nBlanca Estela C. M. is another member of the group \"CUANICUTI\" and is 54 years old.  She finished school until 6th grade and says that she could not continue her studies because her parents couldn't continue supporting her.   Her parents said that women didn't have to go to school because they would just get married and an education would be no use.  Do\u00f1a Blanca is married to Se\u00f1or Miguel who works as a line repairman.  They had 6 children and they are all now married.  Do\u00f1a Blanca sells used clothing at the supply center in Zitacuaro.  She has had a stand there for about 8 years now.  She decided to start this business as a way to help her husband with her medical expenses because she was suffering from menopause and had to purchase expensive medication.  She used to work as a seamstress.  She made wedding dresses, quincea\u00f1era dresses and evening gowns, but, unfortunately, her illness caused her to slowly lose her sight and she couldn't continue sewing.  She is a very hard-working person.  She gets up at 6 am every day to go to work in Toluca in Mexico state to sell her clothing and every Thursday she leaves even earlier to get a spot in the open air market in town.  In Toluca, she buys large quantities of used clothing.  Do\u00f1a Blanca is requesting a loan to purchase used clothing and she also plans to buy used shoes to sell at her stand.

They all live in their own home in San Francisco. Rebeca began working at a very young age in many different stores. She grew up with goals to start her own business. Her dream came true thanks to some savings she made and she has been working independently for 13 years. Nowadays, with a wide and enthusiastic smile she feels she has accomplished one of her most important goals. Her business is rendering lots of profits due to the quality and variety of products she offers to her clients. Normally, she works on her own, but occasionally her children help her. Her store is located in the center of the Rosario community. Thanks to the requested loan she will buy scaffolding and refrigerators to conserve her products.

She began this business to help her husband because his earnings as a day laborer were not enough to cover their household expenses. She will use the loan to purchase five sheep and the animal feed needed to keep them healthy. She hopes to purchase them soon because December is the best month for selling sheep because the people in her town have large parties during the Christmas season. One of her plans is to build a new corral where her animals will be protected from the bad weather, so they do not fall ill.

clients and the concept of supply and demand very well. She also knows that sometimes it is best to change a business and its profile to respond to the costumers' needs and run a profitable small enterprise based on the new directions.\n\nSalma started as a woman's dressmaker in 1997, but since 2010 she is a partner and tailor in a men's suits workshop - a much more profitable and demanded service providing business. The small enterprise is a shared family business and fits perfectly with the demand for having quality traditional suits for men. The imported men clothes do not suit the local market needs neither in design nor in functionality and cultural acceptance.\n\nThe demand for Salma's products is high and Salma would like to increase the productivity of the workshop and expand its capacity. An important item for the expansion is a specific equipment, a machine that works well with the thick, quality suit fabrics. \nWith the potential for growing her business, Salma qualifies to participate in the WLIFT program and is taking a loan from Relief International Microfinance Iraq in the amount of 14,000 USD for the expansion of the tailoring workshop and the purchase of equipment for the enlarged business.    \n\nSalma is enthusiastic about learning more about how to improve her business managerial skills. With a highly positive attitude she is an ambitious and hard working tailor, at the same time she is also a wife and a mother of 3 children. At the age of 40 she is already a role model to many other Iraqi women in her area, having earned much respect for both the quality of her work and her dedication to the business.\n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection. RI-Iraq appreciates Kiva lenders' consideration of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Iraqi borrowers."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1473974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["SME","Growing

Her husband cleans commercial businesses and her two children are grown professionals. \r\n\r\nTeresa has had a low number of children this summer, which can be a common challenge for many daycare providers. To help her through the fluctuation in her income, she has requested a loan from ACCION USA to provide her with working capital and to purchase supplies and toys for the children. This loan will help her to stay in business during the slow season. Without the loan she was worried that she may have to close her doors.\r\n\r\nTeresa has been a victim of predatory lending in the past, but working with ACCION USA she says: \"I felt secure \u2013 they gave me a hope, a medium, a way to continue forward; they\u2019ve opened a pathway to proceed.\"\r\n\r\nTeresa adores children. She says that it is a lot of responsibility to care for other people's children \u2013 their safety is her top concern.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling products  such as dried fish in the local community. Francisca has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Francisca joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Francisca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Francisca is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Francisca from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<P>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Saica has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Saica joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Saica successfully repaid her last loan of 12,000 PHP from GDMPC which was used to purchase additional products to sell. She has now requested a new loan, her fifth with GDMPC, of 20,000 PHP to invest in expanding the business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":542273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

has been practicing mixed farming for thirty-five years in Kisii town, western Kenya. He has employed four farmhands from his community. His farm produces bananas, maize, milk, eggs, pineapples, nappier grass and tea which he sells at the local market and through Kenya Tea Development Authority. He depends on the income from his farming activities to cater for the needs of his family. His biggest challenge has been lack of enough animal feed and transportation problems.\r\n\r\nSamson recently repaid his previous loan of 30,000 KES and has requested this loan of 60,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow. He hopes the income from this loan will enable him to send his children to better schools.

She lives in a small apartment in the north of the city with her only son who is grown up and about to get married.  Sara has managed to establish a good client base which has been growing over the years.  She recently reached the category of 'leader' because of her sales volume and the number of new salespeople that she has introduced to the business.  She gets a discount for the sales that the people she has recommended make.\r\n\r\nSara's average monthly sales total 1,200,000 pesos.  Her average profit margin is 35% although it sometimes increases when she takes advantage of monthly promotions and buys larger quantities of articles with discounts that exceed 50%.\r\n\r\nThis is Sara's fourth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to invest the money in buying aftershave, perfume, cosmetics, sports clothes and ladies' accessories.  She has always stood out for her punctuality in making her repayments and her willingness to participate enthusiastically in all the events to which she is invited.  As well as being a saleswoman, Sara is also a beauty stylist and she usually takes advantage of her customers' visits to offer them these services.  With the end-of-year season approaching, her sales and orders have increased considerably.  She dreams of opening a small store in which she can offer her products.

Carmen has big plans for her business, although at the moment the store is small. She believes that further along, she will be able to expand. One of her most important projects is to enlarge her store and install a soda fountain.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's 17th loan with this institution. She feels good about her group and is very grateful to be able to work with MFP.  And Carmen, who is a founding member of her communal bank, wants to continue the relationship. \r\n\r\nWith the 1,200 new sols requested she will buy more groceries and products for her general store, because she needs to invest to be able to receive earnings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":854546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more groceries and products for her general store, because she needs to invest to be able to receive earnings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-26T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":182.94},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":187.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":196.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":201.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":213.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":219.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.6},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1231.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350921}],"funded_date":"2011-08-27T12:41:31Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":333535,"name":"Flor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor de 53 a\u00f1os de edad vive en Arjona, cerca a la ciudad de Cartagena de Indias, tiene 6 hijos en las edades de 22 a 30 a\u00f1os y desde all\u00ed se dedica a la actividad comercial desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, cuando inici\u00f3 su negocio de producir calzado, con una antigua m\u00e1quina sencilla que le regalaron, con la cual fabric\u00f3 sandalias; cuando esta m\u00e1quina se le da\u00f1\u00f3 la mand\u00f3 a reparar  y el t\u00e9cnico se qued\u00f3 con ella sin explicaci\u00f3n alguna y nunca la devolvi\u00f3.

She\u2019s been engaged in commerce there for the last two years when she started her shoe making business making sandals on an antique, simple sewing machine someone gave her.  When this machine broke down and she sent it to be repaired the technician, with no explanation whatsoever, kept it and never returned it to her.  Even so, Flor insisted in finding ways to earn household income and with much effort she bought an industrial sewing machine and used it to accomplish her production.  She makes very good footwear and she\u2019s excited about the growth of her business.  Her goal is to manufacture large purses and to position her products in a commercial locale which will improve her income by concentrating her market and because of the positioning she\u2019ll have.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is attaining sufficient working capital to invest and increase production and this is why she\u2019s calling upon a Kiva loan, first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy shoe making supplies like: leather, soles, glue, lining, straps, accessories, shoe trees and a display case to arrange her products.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP that she used to expand her business.

Erika is 27 years old, only went to high school and is married to Sr. Armando Reyes. Together they have two children: a seven-year-old boy named Wilian and a six-year-old girl named Monserrat. They attend primary school together.  Erika and her family live in a community called Vista Hermosa (\"Beautiful View\") that belongs to the municipality of Tierra Blanca in the state of Veracruz. In order to arrive at the Vista Hermosa community, one must take a bus from Tierra Blanca that only leaves twice per day: once in the morning and once at noon. The majority of times, people take a bus that drops them off on a road that is another 20 minute walk from their homes. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Erika tells us that a little more than five months ago, she decided to begin her own business selling undergarments for women. She goes door to door in her community, bringing catalogs with her. She brings the order to her suppliers and when it arrives, she delivers it to her customers and receives a payment for her products. She also says that on the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), she makes chiles rellenos (stuffed chili peppers) and donuts filled with dulce de leche (a caramel sauce) and gelatine treats. She offers these products to her clients and delivers them upon request.  Do\u00f1a Erika tells us that she decided to begin her own business because she wanted to help her husband with the living expenses as well as the expenses of her little children's studies. She needs this loan in order to invest in the sale of catalogs, undergarments, flour, chili peppers, meat, eggs, coal and tortillas. She is hoping to continue working hard alongside her spouse, who still hopes to build a home and to provide for her family the best quality of life. She is very grateful for the foundation for the confidence it has in her by offering this loan and for the opportunity for her business to

She works seven days a week. Agnes has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from MCDT SACCO to buy bunches of green bananas.
