R. lives in the community of Aserradero, which is 10 minutes away from the city of Acatlan de Perez Figueroa in the state of Oaxaca. She is 37 years old and is a single mother with one son named Diego, who is 15 years old. He goes to high school in Acatlan. Eva says that she started working outside the home as a shop assistant, but one day she began to sell underclothes by catalog. She realized that she was making more money and had more time to be with her son and to educate him. She has already been selling underclothes for more than two years. She goes door to door selling clothes, bringing the catalogs to her customers. She brings the orders to her suppliers and later when the orders arrive, she delivers them to her customers and receives the payments for her products. She sells in her community and also goes to other towns such as Cosolapa, Tezonapa, Refugio and Motzorongo. She decided to start working because she is a single mother and she has to feed and clothe her son.\r\n\r\nMs. Eva also has a small corral behind her house where she keeps lambs that she raises and later sells. She needs the loan to invest in the purchase of catalogs, underclothes and because she wants to continue working so that her son can be an educated professional in the future. Eva is very grateful to the foundation for the opportunity that it has given her, so that her business can prosper and also for the trust they have shown in her by granting her this loan.

She is married and her children are now attending school. Because of difficulties in providing her children their needs, Jocelyn\u2019s husband goes abroad and works as a driver. Her husband's remittances are used for the household expense of their family in the Philippines.\r\nWith the determination to help her husband provide for their children's expenses, Jocelyn started a hog-raising business one year ago.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and is a father of four children. He lives in Istaravshan and has a ten year experience at his job. He is a carpenter and makes doors and windows. The raw material is mostly wood and to buy the raw materials he needs financial means.

and lives in the zone of Para\u00edso in Guayaquil, which is located in the outskirts of the city.  She has a brick house with only electricity and lacks almost all basic services.  She began selling sweets, toys, posters, and other things for children outside of a school near her house.  When they got to know her, she moved the business to her house, but she still goes to sell pens, pencils, notebooks, and posters when school begins (between 6:30 and 7:30 am) and ends (between 12:00 and 1:00 pm).  \r\n\r\nEuduvis saw that in her neighborhood not only were school supplies essential but also food supplies are.  She would like to buy sugar, rice, eggs, and oils.

They average 42 years of age and have an average of three children each.\r\n\r\nThis group of women sell a variety of articles such as firewood, clothes, condiments, smoked and dried fish, vegetables etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the level of their activities, the members decided five years ago to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program. They are now on their twelfth group loan and all the previous loans were repaid on time. \r\n\r\nRabiata Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is a member of the group and she sells firewood. She is planning to use this loan to buy lorry loads of firewood from producers. She gets her wood in different corners of the bush. Her stock of wood, which is very significant, is stored in a place in front of the door. She sells the wood on a wholesale and retail basis, and for cash, from home to a customer base made up of women and men. \r\n\r\nWhile the members of the Danaya group expect to make a monthly profit of 110,000FCFA each during the course of the cycle, Rabiata Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 expects to make 160,000FCFA. As well as paying off their loans, they use a part of their income to cover everyday family expenses. They would like to reinforce their partnership with Soro Yiriwaso so that supplies do not get too short..  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":533816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of firewood                                                                                              ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabiata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nah  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779258},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961469},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699585},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913476},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180642},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84658.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476607}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T00:28:26Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":202059,"name":"Chheun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Chheun V. is a 37-year-old fisherman and father, blessed with five children, all of whom are attending the public high school.

For this reason, she is always working hard to attract more customers.\r\n\r\nNancy would like to have stable capital with which she could acquire more products and have a stable stock of cosmetics which would enable her customers to acquire the products they need quickly, without having to wait until the end of the month which is when her orders are delivered.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Esta es la primera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, ella es una nueva integrante en su banco comunal, por lo que se compromete a ser puntual en sus pagos. El dinero que viene solicitando ser\u00e1 destinado a la compra de una nueva licuadora, vasos y el pago del mantenimiento de los televisores que usa para los video juegos. ","en":"Janeth is 19 years old and lives with her parents.  For the past year she has been running two businesses simultaneously:  in the mornings she sells juices, and in the afternoons she manages a video game center set up in her home.  She earns more money with the latter, and is very happy with the rapid progress that she has made.  Her parents sometimes help her, because she is doing this to pay for her studies.  In the future, Janeth hopes to purchase equipment for both businesses, with better utensils for the sale of juices and video game consoles.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is a new member of her communal bank and has promised to be punctual with her payments.  The money she is requesting will be used to purchase a new blender and glasses, and to pay for the maintenance on televisions used for the video games.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":365068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"Repair equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T04:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":79.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":82.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":84.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.77},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.68},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.04,"local_amount":74.4,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":76.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641697},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":79.42,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081139},{"amount":28.77,"local_amount":82.22,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":84.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997289},{"amount":29.68,"local_amount":84.8,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842633},{"amount":62.71,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":184.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734208}],"funded_date":"2009-08-07T05:45:34Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":131588,"name":"Leticia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leticia runs a general store.

Her husband, Fernando, aged 44, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children aged from six to 17. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,100, uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to purchase fertilizers for her vegetable farm and food for her pigs so she can continue to save up for her children's future education.

D. is from the village of Estrada. She is 55 years old. Pehinia is widowed and has four grown children. To make a living, Pehinia owns and operates a general store. Pehinia is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Pehinia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and enable her to engage in business activities. Pehinia is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken by Pehinia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

El Cedro is in the state of Veracruz.  Development cooperatives are groups of 10 or more individuals who have a bank account and who have to meet weekly or every two weeks in order to make their payments.  This group has a representative and a governing committee, and is comprised of ten members.  \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s representative is named Adolfo G. G\u00f3mez.  Adolfo is 48 years old, married, and has two children.  He is going to set up a stationery store in his home and needs a loan so that he can purchase blank paper, cards, and other supplies.  His customers are the children who attend the school that is situated a half block from his house.  Adolfo has been a teacher at that school for twenty-seven years.  He tells us that times are difficult, and so he decided to find other work in order to earn a little more.  Adolfo wants this loan so that he can increase his earnings and thus be able to purchase basic foodstuffs for his children. He hopes that his children will finish their studies someday and be able to purchase their own homes.  He is happy to be the group\u2019s president, since he wants to help the rest of the group, and without help from the other members they would not receive this loan.\r\n\r\nAgustina Mi\u00f1\u00f3n M. serves as treasurer on El Cedro group\u2019s governing committee.

She makes a living selling gold, hand-sewn goods, embroideries, and paintings, and needs a loan so that she can purchase gold jewelry and cut glass.  Her customers are her neighbors and include other members of El Cedro group, who purchased jewelry and bathroom sets from her.  She has made a living from sewing for twenty-four years and learned this craft when she was in school, but she has only been painting for a little while.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

their house come true.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful to Emprender and to Kiva for the trust placed in him by granting the loan.\r\n\r\n   \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Con el tiempo, espera comprar m\u00e1s tierras y as\u00ed incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Este es el sexto pr\u00e9stamo de Renee con MFP y esta ahorrando para pagar sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a las socias de su banco comunal, donde se siente muy contenta. Con los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s abono para que sus cultivos sean m\u00e1s productivos.\n\n","en":"Renee is a 45 year old woman who is hardworking and cheerful.  She lives in her own home with her husband Nicol\u00e1s, age 45, and their three young children for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life.  The long days of working on her land have made Renee an expert in agriculture.  She takes good care of her crops so that they grow in healthy conditions, which gives her an advantage when it comes time to sell them.  Renee always gets a good price for the coffee and bananas that she produces.  What she enjoys most about her work is cultivating the land since it is something she has done since she was a little girl.  She has been doing this for 30 years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products to the city of La Merced.  In time she hopes to buy more land so that she can increase her production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  Renee sets aside enough money so that she can make her payments on time because she does not want to create problems for the members of her Communal Bank.  She feels happy to be part of this group.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy more compost for her crops so that she can be more productive.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":559483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588330}],"funded_date":"2010-07-02T13:33:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":214380,"name":"Getrude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Getrude is a single woman with two children, both of whom attend school.

Solijon is 36 years old and is married. Together with his wife they have four children, all of whom are still young and attending school. They are farmers who own a plot of land in their village and grow different kinds of crops like, wheat, potato, onion and other vegetables. They have been in this business since 2003. These crops are the main source of income for their family.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their collective knowledge and experience in their respective markets gives them confidence that they will be able to confront adversity and come out ahead. The loan will be used to buy tools, ingredients and primary materials, so that the group members can expand their businesses and increase their incomes in order to be able to offer their children better educations and a better quality of life. The majority of the group's members have experience with communal banking and know how to manage loan repayments responsibly and honestly, and how to take full advantage of this opportunity offered by the Agrocapital Foundation for a better life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

T., and Fania Yudel V. E..  The three are from the same  community and have a strong credit history together. Each has received loans previously and as a result has seen their respective businesses grow.\n\nMar\u00eda will use this loan to purchase used clothing for her resale shop, the loan allows her to buy in bulk and therefore receive a better price. She will also buy chickens and pigs in order to supplement the income of her store. For fifteen years her store has supported she and her two children, ages 10 and 13, they are both in school. Maria dreams of being able to afford home improvements such as building brick walls.\n\nJuan is married and has five children, the eldest two are more than 20 years old, the rest are still in school.  Of late his family faces the difficulty of Sugar Disease which Juan\u2019s wife has fallen ill with. Juan used other loans to purchase a cart and a horse to pull it. This loan will go towards improvements to the cart and the purchase of wood for resale. Juan has sold wood and driven his carriage for thirteen years since he fell ill and could not work in the fields. He dreams that his business will continue to provide for his children\u2019s education. \n\nFania Yudel is single with a 2 year old son.

She owns a business venture raising cattle.  Naomi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Naomi needs a loan of WST $1500. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 tala or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Naomi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Naomi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Naomi T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

They know what they are going to do to earn their livelihood. The group's leader, Damira, is among them. A 36-year-old hairdresser and mother of three children, Damira has dedicated many years to her occupation. She was just a 16-year-old girl when she finished hairdressing courses. She swiftly learned all aspects of her profession, providing all kinds of hair-related services: various haircuts, hair dyeing styles, hair setting, and hairdos (e.g., waved, curled, perm, marcel waves, etc.). She has become an A1 specialist. She has assigned a room and adjusted it to be a hairdressing salon. By saving her profits, she recently purchased a car. Damira feels that she can do better and that she is just not using all the opportunities. So, she has planned to make an improvement at her salon. She is firmly convinced that if she furnishes and decorates her salon, more customers will be attracted. Damira needs a loan to equip her salon with shelves and wallpaper. In the near future, she is going to expand her business by taking on a few apprentices. People do grow when they have a vision of how to do that.\r\n<p>\r\nDamira\u2019s partners: <br>\r\nGulzina, age 44 and mother of two children, works as a cleaner at a casino. She needs a loan to buy building materials for her kitchen and to buy a chandelier. <br>\r\nJumabu is age 56. She and her husband are farmers. They have three children. They need a loan to buy fuels and lubricants, as well as to pay for transportation services and to pay workers for harvesting. <br>\r\nEdilbek, age 35, is married and has one child. He works as an assistant station-master in \"Tuz\" substation. He needs a loan to place a crusher at the same substation and to buy some cement for installing it. <br>\r\nAida, age 38, is a housewife. She sells milk and also produces cheese and butter. She needs a loan to buy a milk cow. <br>\r\nNazgul, age 38, is married. She has three children. To make a living she sells yogurt, sour cream and cottage cheese. She hopes to get a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?<br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan. Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of a 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (to be profitable, to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, in-coming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

Every day, very early in the morning, Julia begins caring for her land since she knows that the profits she makes from her sales will depend on the quality of her products.  Her crops are cacao, coffee and coca leaf.  These are products which are in most demand in her area.  She takes them to sell in the city of San Francisco as this is where she gets the best prices.
