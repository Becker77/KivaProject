Leticia has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nLeticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Leticia is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Leticia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Every morning he begins work in the early morning hours at his job in public transportation.  Since Metrado is located far way, there is not access to vehicles.  As a result there is great demand for the service Denis provides, which helps him generate a good income.  In addition to this job, Denis also spends a great deal of time farming.  He has his own land on which he grows coffee and bananas to sell in the city of Pichanaki during times of peak demand.  Denis enjoys pruning branches and harvesting the bananas.  On the other hand, he wants to grow coffee so that he can raise enough capital to buy more farmland.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is grateful for the support of his Communal Bank.

A year and a half ago, she started working independently in multiple businesses.  These include selling blankets, household goods such as pots, as well as organizing social events.  Saby sells her products through catalogs, which gives her customers time to choose the products and goods they want that they can pay for later.  She enjoys both businesses and being able to work independently.  However, Saby says her greatest difficulty is when her customers do not pay their bills on time. She has overcome this problem by enacting collection strategies.  Her greatest wish is to have more capital so that her business will be more profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Saby is extremely happy to know that she has financial support, so she has always demonstrated responsibility with her payments.  In addition, she is grateful to be part of her group because all the members are responsible and support people.  She thanks those responsible for approving her loan request since the funds will be useful in advancing her businesses.  The loan she requested will be used to by merchandise such as blankets, sheets, and other household goods.

Four years ago, when   Marlenis started providing transportation for children, she saw the market with the mothers of these little ones- the opportunity to sell them merchandise. She started with encouragement from a friend, who was already in the business via a catalogue. In this way, she got her first customers and gradually, with good service and what she was offering, her clientele grew.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary, and he also has a store that sells clothes. Mohammad wants to do a bulk purchase of clothes for the coming winter season so that he can have a new collection for sale, but the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Mohammad gets the loan, he will be able to purchase bulk of winter clothes for sale, so he will have a better, new collection to compete and increase his sales and increase his income. Mohammad is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Right now she needs a loan to buy another bale of clothes because most of her funds have been spent on school fees now that the children are reporting for school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4375,"image":{"id":165103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase an inventory of used clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rubaga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 32.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-08-02T04:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4375,"lender_count":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shifah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-23T20:57:21Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1775000},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1775000},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1775000},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1775000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1093.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1094,"local_amount":1775405.71,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-24T07:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1778844,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335745},{"amount":1094,"local_amount":1775405.71,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1778844,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369923},{"amount":1093.25,"local_amount":1774188.58,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1777624.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5344324},{"amount":1093.75,"local_amount":1775000,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1778437.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966445}],"funded_date":"2008-08-09T20:57:21Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T02:35:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54566,"name":"Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hassan, 32 years old, is married and has 1 child.

Her customers are made up generally of workers (both men and women).<p>\r\nHer business cycle is monthly and she expects to realize a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA.

Inomjon is a very courageous man who is characterized as someone who can manage tough jobs like raising livestock. He's the father of three children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. \r\n<p>\r\nIn spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, Inomjon has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of animals to breed on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Inomjon comes to IMON International for loans for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is divorced and has raised two children on her own, both of whom are at school. Even though her family consists of just three members, Nargiza has to work hard to provide them with a worthy life. She makes a living by selling video and audio CDs, DVDs and mp3 players. Sometimes, she even manages to trade in cattle. She is very fortunate to have a caring brother, who is always by her side at difficult times. When Nargiza leaves her stall to transport goods, he replaces her so that trade is not interrupted.   \r\n<p>\r\nTwo years in business have brought her evident results: purchase of a car for transporting goods, and some convenience goods for her home. Her original investment was $70 USD, and her current monthly income is around $480 USD. Nargiza's plan is to build a house and set her children on their feet by providing them with a good education. For this, Nargiza needs a loan to purchase video and audio CDs, DVDs, children\u2019s school uniform, table napkins and diapers, as she has noticed a growing demand for these goods. \r\n<p>\r\nNargiza\u2019s partners are Nariste, Baktygul, Larisa and Nurlan. Nariste, 26, is married. Her husband is a security guard at a casino, whereas she buys milk products wholesale and sells them at the market. She needs a loan to buy butter, cottage cheese and sour cream. \r\n<p>\r\nBaktygul, 34, has two children. She sells foodstuffs in a small shop. In addition, she sells chewing gum, cigarettes and vitamins, at the city market. Baktygul needs a loan to purchase school equipment, cereals, soft drinks and ice-creams. \r\n<p>\r\nLarisa, 34, is married and has three children. She trades in fish, and her husband is a minibus driver. Larisa needs a loan to purchase frozen fish, school equipment and clothes for her children. \r\n<p>\r\nNurlan, 30, is married with one child. He works as a security guard at two locations. In addition, he manages to keep cattle. He needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She lives in a small house with her two sons, Wilson (age 22) and Gerber (age 20), who are the reason behind all her efforts.\r\n<p>\r\nNarcissa has been raising cattle in order to forge a decent life for herself.  She learned how to take care of animals at a young age and now her cattle are some of the most sought after livestock being sold in the city of Juliaca.  Narcissa is a native of Taraco (a district in the province of Huancan\u00e9).  She enjoys caring for her animals because the more attention she given them, the higher the prices she can command.  For 30 years, Narcissa has been at her job and says the most difficult part for her is transporting her animals to market because it demands much time and effort.  At some point in the future, she would like to open a grocery store so that she can generate additional income and improve her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Narcissa feels the responsibility of making her payments on time because she does not want to get in trouble with the other members of her Communal Bank.  She is adored by everyone else because she brings much joy to all of their meetings.  Narcissa will use her loan of 1000 soles to buy a cow, but she needs to save up some additional funds in order to complete the purchase.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":417331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-30T10:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997708},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843130},{"amount":175.35,"local_amount":501,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734708},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992622}],"funded_date":"2009-10-30T12:17:55Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":153052,"name":"Mrs. Moun Sott Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Moun S. lives in Tuol Kdei village in Kandal province, and is part of the Mrs. Moun S.

She sells her merchandise for cash to a customer base composed essentially of housewives.\r\n\r\nWith this first loan she anticipates realizing an average monthly profit of 90,000 CFA that will be used principally to increase her working capital,  contribute to the family\u2019s expenses and to pay the interest on her loan.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":560738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699771},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913686},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180818},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476786},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613499},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":35464.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751928}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T21:35:42Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":215209,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Leonarda C. tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en union libre con el Se\u00f1or Rodolfo Rivas quien trabaja en la Empresa Nacional Portuaria.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Mylene has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mylene joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mylene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Mylene is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Mylene from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It\u2019s time to promote women\u2019s interests in the area of business.\r\n\r\nKanyshai B., 24, is the treasurer of this group. She cannot imagine her life without dance and fitness. She believes in the saying \u201cHealthy spirit is in a healthy body.\u201d She owns a fitness club, where she teaches ladies of all ages how to stay fit. The idea of opening this club was her husband's. He is also an experienced businessman. While on maternity leave, she wrote a business plan for a fitness club. Fortunately, her funds managed to cover all of the expenses, including attracting customers, advertising, and equipment. The income from the business was used to purchase a small piece of land where Kanyshai would like to build a shop. She requests a loan to purchase equipment for running. It is the only thing she lacks in the fitness club. Her dream in the future is to build a health club for women. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

three children. Nineteen years ago in search of a source of income for his family Manasbek started his business selling food and basic goods using the sum of 5,000 som (KGS). Manasbek's store is known for good quality products which are sold at a low price, which is important for people with low incomes. Through persistence and hard work Manasbek was able to develop his business with a monthly income of about 20,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn order to further develop his business Manasbek turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to expand the product range. Manasbek plans to invest the income from loan in the expansion of retail

de estar unidos siempre y apoyarse entre ellos, ejemplo que les quiere dejar a sus dos hijos para cuando conformen su propio hogar. Desde muy jovencita le gust\u00f3 estar bien arreglada y maquillada, y debido a que invertir en la compra de cosm\u00e9ticos es costoso, tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de formar parte de las promotoras de belleza de su localidad.  Y desde hace 7 a\u00f1os ha ganado experiencia en realizar esta actividad, ya que para Rosa, el secreto es visitar a varias personas y salir diariamente a ofrecerles productos novedosos a trav\u00e9s de cat\u00e1logos y distribuirlos en las fechas indicadas para tener contenta a su clientela. Ahora tiene la ambici\u00f3n de ser empresaria, pues en las l\u00edneas de belleza motivan a las mujeres a no ser s\u00f3lo promotoras, sino a buscar un equipo a las cuales puedas liderar y capacitar en las ventas, pero sin descuidar sus propios pedidos, por lo que le gustar\u00eda tener una tienda para la venta de estos productos. Rosa viene trabajando con MFP, desde hace 6 a\u00f1os, este es su catorceavo cr\u00e9dito, y durante esta temporada ha visto progresar a su grupo, pues tratan de organizarse adecuadamente para evitar circunstancias dif\u00edciles. Los 1500 soles que solicita los usar\u00e1 en la compra de productos para las fechas festivas que se aproximan, como el d\u00eda de las madres.","en":"For Rosa, the well-being of her loved ones is the most important thing, and so in her home they try to always remain supportive of one another.  This is an example she wants to leave her children for when they form their own homes.  Ever since she was a young girl, she has liked to care for her appearance and use makeup, and due to the high cost of buying cosmetics, she decided to become a cosmetics salesperson in her area.  For the past 7 years she has gained experience in this activity.  Rosa's secret is to visit many people and go out every day to offer them the newest products by means of catalogs, and then deliver the products by the deadline in order to keep her clients happy.   Now she has the ambition to be a business woman, since the beauty products business encourages the women to not only be product promoters, but to look for a team they can lead and equip in sales, but without neglecting their own customers' orders.  For this reason she would like to have a store to sell these products.  Rosa has been working with MFP for 6 years, this is her fourteenth loan, and during this period she has seen her group progress, since they try to organize themselves in order to avoid difficult circumstances.  She will use the 1,500 soles she is requesting to buy products for the approaching holidays, like Mothers' Day.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":318329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-14T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":226.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":232.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":242.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":255.47},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":266.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":277.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.03},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":226.2,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":236.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596238},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":232.14,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":242.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990516},{"amount":85.03,"local_amount":242.94,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":253.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211627},{"amount":89.41,"local_amount":255.47,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":266.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641148},{"amount":93.15,"local_amount":266.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":278.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080588},{"amount":96.99,"local_amount":277.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":289.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996713}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T11:14:06Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":111945,"name":"Nicolaza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nicolaza es socia D.

O. lives in the village of Brgy. Pandan, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is 66 years old, but still very determined to improve her business even though she now is a widow. She has five children who help her in running the business. Most of her children have their own family, yet still help her. Her dream is to continue her business to become more progressive and continue to borrow from NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nIn business for over 46 years, Evelyntina proves her skills in business management because she has remained engaged in business for such a long time. She is very thankful for her business because it contributes a lot in fulfilling her dreams in life. While in business, one may encounter problems, but these also were overcome and as a result helped to make Evelyntina strong. In 2001, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon for the purpose of expanding her business and to have access to capital. She expanded her business by adding a pig fattening business as an additional source of income. In every month she was able to earn Php 8,000. This amount was used to defray household expenses, and build savings. She maintains her good credit performance because of the continuing income of her business.\r\n\r\nPreviously she borrowed Php 19,500 for her general store and pig fattening. The said loan was fully paid on time. Now she is borrowing the same amount of Php 19,500 as additional capital for her 18th loan cycle. The income from this loan will be used for the expansion of her business and support the daily family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":417335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyntina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":6240,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":6487.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848995},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4054.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739663},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129083},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965880},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997794}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T03:00:14Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shali"}},{"id":153068,"name":"Kunthy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kunthy S. lives in Andoung Samretth village in Takeo province.

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business where she sells silver jewelry, other accessories and womens shoes. She will use the profits to buy some school supplies, to eat better and expand her business to other communities in other products. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying cooking for her family and doing her housework. She is excited to have this loan because she wants to invest more, get low interest and save money for the future.\r\n\r\nFelicia's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries, the main economic activity is a free trading zone, a cement factory, and others. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and unreliable

She lives in Purok Dungcaan, Barangay Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1994 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her fish vending\/fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $229. \r\n\r\nMercedita is borrowing 24,000 PHP to use as additional capital and to purchase fishing supplies. This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of 21,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Mercedita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nThis photo was taken after the center meeting, because fish were delivered early in the morning.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Theresa is married and lives in San Remegio, Cebu. She earns a living by fishing and fish vending.  Her husband Dionisio, 55, is also a fisherman, who works hard to increase their income and develop their businesses.  They have nine children in the ages between 5 and 35 years. Ma. Theresa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the last four loans taken from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Theresa has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000,  uplifting her family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 that she intends to use for buying fishing nets which should boost her fish vending business. She wants to continue saving up for her children's education in the future. Ma. Teresa is a Dungganon woman who is working hard to fulfill her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband helps out any way that he can by washing customers\u2019 hair, but this is the only source of income for their family right now. Yorma learned how to cut hair eight ears ago, but only two years ago did start cutting hair professionally. Her daughter who is 17 years old gives manicures and paints nails while her mother cuts hair. Yorma has borrowed from the loan sharks before, but she was hardly able to scrape enough money after having to pay them 20% monthly! This hard-working entrepreneur wants this loan so that buy more products like hairdryers, hair-washing sinks, hair and skin treatments, conditioners, permanent hair dyes, spray, enamel, and acetone.

He is 32 years old and married with a 2-year-old child.  He also takes care of his mother and a nephew orphaned by his father.  <p>\r\n\r\nJorge completed basic study at the 7 de Setembro (September 7, Mozambique\u2019s Independence Day in 1974) school in Xai-xai.  Because a shortage of vacancies in middle school prevented him from continuing his studies, he had to apply early for a spot as a basic level teacher in 1997.  The following year he entered the Matola Primary school for teaching, where he finished in 1999.  In 2000 he applied for a teaching position in Catembe and because he had the will to continue his studies he applied to the higher education institute Maria M\u00e3e Africa (Mother Maria Africa), earned his Bachelor\u2019s degree, and continues to pursue a License in Educational Sciences.  <p>\r\n\r\nJorge has been employed as a teacher since 2000 and works from 7:00 to 11:45am as a professor, trained by the courses he took.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Iskandar is a loving and self-sacrificing son. Ever since he was very young, Iskandar has been around people raising animals, and thanks to this knowledge, he dedicates himself raising and selling cattle, work that he learned from his humble parents. With experience gained over time in the purchase and sales of cattle he has been able to bring stability to his family. \r\n<p>\r\nThe desire that Iskandar harbors in his heart is that of increasing his capital to invest in acquiring more animals. By doing this, he can create more income for his family. He requests 4000 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

N. is 28 and married with 2 children (ages 5 and 8).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Susi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Susi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Susi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Susi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Susi N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Q. to work since he was 8 years old and just a child. He began by selling fruit in the park of his native city, and later when he was still a youth, he decided to seek other opportunities, and he traveled to Medellin, Colombia, to continue his struggle. \r\n\r\nWith the small savings he had, he set up a butcher shop, but after he started working, he began to drink too much alcohol, a situation which affected all areas of his life. It was then that he decided to seek work with a company, so he could gain self-discipline and leave his dependency behind. For 8 years, he worked as an employee, and he was able to overcome this difficulty, which, as he himself affirms, is the kind of situation that allows people to grow as individuals.  \r\n\r\nHis entrepreneurial spirit was still latent within him, and he next decided to start his own business again: this time a general store with household necessities, which has become the source of sustenance for himself and his family. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Liberto needs a loan to buy various products, since the money he had set aside for this purpose had to be invested in repairing a refrigeration unit.

He is 40 years old and lives with his wife. They have two children, who are Claudio's pride. He worked hard to build his own house so that his family could live comfortably. Farming is the only profession that Claudio knows, and he's been working at it since he was a small child learning from his parents. When he was young, Claudio wanted to be a taxi driver, but because he was very close to his parents he never left his hometown. He fell in love there and realized that it was necessary to leave his parents' home. \r\n\r\nSince then, Claudio and his wife have used perseverance to plant and harvest their own crops, which have been very profitable. Thanks to the good prices at which they sell their products, they were able to buy land and construct their home out of wood. They now have a comfortable space for their family. In his years as a farmer Claudio has accumulated experience, and now when he doesn't have the necessary fertilizers or pesticides he's able to prepare smoke or manure to help improve the crop, even though these aren't as good as chemical fertiilizers. During the four previous loan cycles Claudio has been punctual in his repayments with MFP, and has promised to continue this trend for the fifth loan. The money will go to purchase 30 bags of nitrate fertilizer for his coffee crop. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":337965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-19T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3005,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992339}],"funded_date":"2009-06-20T01:29:06Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":120169,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felicia is 48 years old.

During her almost five years in ASHI, she has shown herself to be industrious and determined to make her dreams come true. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve their standard of living through the proceeds of her variety store business that she has established with the support of the loans she has requested from ASHI.The variety store business has brought happiness to Evelyn\u2019s family, and especially to her. Because of its profits, she has been able to send her children to school. Being a good mother, Evelyn\u2019s dreams are always for her children and family. She always wanted to support her children to have a brighter tomorrow and a decent life.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, Evelyn is requesting a loan from ASHI amounting to 30,000 Php to purchase more supplies for her store in order to attract more customers. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for inventory of groceries for her store. She is very determined and disciplined to use the money which is lent to her. This would not only provide her with happiness in life, but would also make her business grow and make more profit, which will allow her to support the educational needs of her four children until they graduate from college.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is hopeful that her business will grow into a full-fledged mini-grocery store and that someday she will have branches in nearby villages. One of her aspirations is to be able to build a house that is durable and spacious.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goals are to purchase a new 'jeepney' (public transport vehicle) and tricycle (three-wheeled motorcycle) so she can expand her business to other surrounding neighborhoods.

Being used to working for the collective good, for Nazarkulovs it was new to start their own business. Anarhan N. is 53 years old, she is a leader of this group. At her husband's initiative was the first to buy 2000 soms worth of cattle for breeding. Because agriculture is a seasonal source of income, animal husbandry turned out to be a good addition to the family's savings account. The winter time is a time off from agriculture, but Anarhan now has to take care of the animals. During winter the animals need special care more than in the summer time when the cattle can take care of itself.\r\n\r\nAnarhan's husband is a hydraulics technician, they have a fifteen year old daughter who is financially dependent on them. Their older son is 25 and works in the Tashkumyrskiy GAO and also provides his share in the development of their family business.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen year term has justified Anarhan's anticipation. At this time the agriculture business together with animal husbandry bring Anarhan around 9500 soms of monthly income. As all the other farmers Anarhan is anxiously waiting for the beginning of the sowing season. The purchase of the fertilizer will be her main expense and this is why she wants to take out the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":729554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for sowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tashkomur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T08:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anarhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u041d\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044c","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0422\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0421\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0431\u0443","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0411\u0443\u0440\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0411\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0439","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":83000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8931},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9310},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9613},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10190},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10544},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":10991},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":11457},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":11964}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.3},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222.32},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.73},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":188.3,"local_amount":8931,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":8933.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201324297},{"amount":196.3,"local_amount":9310,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":9312.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192745},{"amount":202.68,"local_amount":9613,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":9615.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571549},{"amount":214.85,"local_amount":10190,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10192.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546209},{"amount":222.32,"local_amount":10544,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10546.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714805},{"amount":231.73,"local_amount":10991,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10993.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085132},{"amount":241.57,"local_amount":11457,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":11459.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846795},{"amount":252.25,"local_amount":11964,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":11966.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661825}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T22:49:50Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:53:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":284920,"name":"Fernalin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fernalin M. is from the village of Corrales, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

He carries out this work every day for the purpose of improving the living conditions for his family, bringing the daily bread to his table, and saving for the improvement of his dwelling, which needs a lot of help because it is in a bad state. His family admires him for the fact that his multiple efforts have permitted him to feed them and provided them with good living conditions.  \r\n\r\nDavron wants to develop and invest in his business through the purchase of more cows.   He hopes that IMON International, with the help of Kiva, will offer him the loan needed to expand his business.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

The ladies have various businesses including jewelry and clothing sales, the sale of medicines and the sales of food items. Zonia, who is President of the group, is 65 years old, married and has five children. Zonia was able to stay in school until the 6th grade and is very aware of the value of a good education. She works hard at her little boarding house so that she can afford to send each of her children to the university. She charges by the month and includes meals in the price for a room. Zonia also has a textile business and makes napkins, table cloths and embroidered pillowcases. She is requesting a loan that she will use to buy a refrigerator, tables, curtains and sheets. Zonia wants to be certain that her guests are well-cared for and comfortable. Because of previous loans and earnings, she has been able to enlarge her house and offer more rooms to her guests.\n\nEach month, Zonia welcomes the ladies to the meeting and the first order of business is to take care of payments on the loans. Next, a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge conducts an educational training using games, diagrams, role playing and pictures. Most of the women have had little or no formal education.  If they do not speak Spanish, the training is conducted in the native language of the women. \n\nKIVA investors are greatly valued by Zonia and the women of the Trust Bank for providing funding for their loans.

She also has a stand in the market.  She lives with her husband, Basilio, a solderer; and her children Larri, 17; and Sara, 8.  \r\n\r\nShe has been in her business for seven years.  She is very happy because she has the comfort of working in her own house.  Besides selling food, she also sells cleaning and bathroom products to satisfy her customers\u2019 needs.  Because she is the only nearby store in her neighborhood, earnings are good.  \r\n\r\nElsy is progressing little by little, but having to take care of her other business in the market makes the day short.  It makes her very tired.  Income from her stand is not going well because she has to pay the guards and the rent, which takes almost all of the earnings.  That is why she has decided to solely work at the store she has in her house.  This also has the advantage of allowing her to care for her children, especially the little one who is school aged and needs her support.\r\n\r\nElsy wants to progress.  That is why she needs to fix her store to make her customers more comfortable and sell in greater tranquility.\r\n\r\nShe has been working with Mircofinanzas Prisma for various years.  This is her 16th loan.  She really likes the work in her Community Bank.  All of its members are united and honest.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is now asking for to buy more merchandise for her store.  She will also make some repairs to her store to make it more comfortable and attractive to her customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":347754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise and fix store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-05T15:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":374.04},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":387.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":405.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":424.53},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":445.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":462.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.87},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":123.43,"local_amount":374.04,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":374.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211976},{"amount":127.91,"local_amount":387.62,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":388.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641504},{"amount":133.87,"local_amount":405.66,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":406.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080943},{"amount":140.09,"local_amount":424.53,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":425.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997085},{"amount":147.07,"local_amount":445.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":446.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842436},{"amount":152.63,"local_amount":462.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":463.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733988}],"funded_date":"2009-07-25T18:56:14Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":124281,"name":"Estrella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrella A. lives in Valencia City, Bukidnon.

They live in the district of Santa Rosa, located 25 minutes of the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\n<p>The separation from her husband motivated her to look for a job three years ago in order to support her children.  She started selling fish in the fishing terminal and continues the activity to this day.  Tomasa along with a group of her neighbors, usually wait in the Pimentel pier (Balneario some 10 minutes from the district) for the boats who come to the dock after their fishing workday ends to buy their fish and sell them later in the terminal to various merchants in the region.\r\n\r\n<p>The fishing business temporarily gave her the necessary funds to survive but the close season made her consider going into another business to keep supporting her family.  She set up in her home a small grocery store, where she sells basic household goods (rice, sugar, and oil); fruits, vegetables and candy.\r\n\r\n<p> This business is taken care of by her eldest daughter in the mornings and by Tomasa in the afternoons.  She still sells fish in the terminal but does not gain the same profit as before.  She wishes to maintain her store and stop selling fish to dedicate more time to her children.  This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa (kiva\u2019s field partner) for a loan of 1500 nuevos soles that she will use to meet her goal.\r\n\r\n<p>Tomasa wishes to sell school supplies in her business as well, since the place where she lives there aren\u2019t any businesses of this type and the children (including hers) have to walk to the center of the city to get their school supplies.\r\n\r\n<p> This will be her first loan with Edpyme Alternativa.

R. lives in the Paraiso district of Guayaquil.  He lives in a cement home with water and light; however, it lacks paved roads and a sewer system. He has 3 children, who are aged 7, 8 and 12; all are in the public school system. \r\n<p>\r\nMr. Z. used to work in a food market called Montebello. One day he decided to bring some vegetables home to sell. He sold the products rapidly, so he decided to create a mini market in his home, and little by little it has grown. Now he has expanded it into a bazaar. He works from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. with his wife.  Their best-selling items are rice, shampoo and cola.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Z. is trying to augment the bazaar portion of his store, so he is requesting a loan to buy clothes, stuffed animals and makeup. He says these items are especially popular around the holidays.  Transportation of products is a huge obstacle for him, so in the future he hopes to have a vehicle.

She owns a business venture, selling baked goods in the local community.  Selina has 2 years of experience in this business.  Selina needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business to assist her family with the business activities such as a food stall for the school canteen.\n\nIn 2009, Selina joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Selina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Selina P. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:
