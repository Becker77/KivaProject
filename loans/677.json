This has been a very successful business.  When Andrei originally intended to start his business he was skeptical because he did not have enough money to launch the business. He had just closed a lucrative soap shop temporarily to move to a new location. After finally signing the lease, not even two weeks before he was to open, the owners of the property told him that he could not sell jewelry there because his shop would be competing with a major new store that was opening soon. Andrei had two choices. He could either back out of the lease or continue with the lease with a different product mix. This was a very viable location and he did not want to let it go. Over the coming days Andrei had to come up with an idea that he could feel comfortable with in order to move forward. He already had the oils because he carried them in his soap shop, so he decided to renegotiate the lease for a small fragrance shop instead. He knows that this would turn out to be one of the best decisions of his life. Andrei borrowed from the Kiva partner, Microinvest, to pay for the original rental of the shop. Andrei is sure that he will succeed in his business and will return the loan in time to Microinvest.

The loan will be used to buy more quantities of coffee that Sylivia can sell to customers in her community. Sylivia hopes to expand her business and possibly sell other products, and gain a greater income for her family.    \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders: <\/b>BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.

She is married to Fidmer, age 33, and they live in their own home with only one of their three children.  From a young age Rosario worked on a farm.  Her parents were experienced farmers who taught her all the farming techniques that she now employs.  Since then, fifteen years have passed.  She now works independently growing potatoes and her husband helps with monitoring their crops.  Rosario loves the land where she was born and has always planted large tracts of potatoes because the area where she lives is in high altitude, making it an ideal place for producing the best tubers.  What she enjoys most is aligning the rows of potatoes, a technique that has helped her develop freely as a farmer and has resulted in successful crops.  However, she has to carry heavy sacks of potatoes and transport them directly to the market where the buyers are located.  She does all this in order to have more income.  Rosario hopes to open a vending post at the city market where she can sell vegetables and potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first time she has taken a loan with MFP.  Rosario is happy to be working with this Communal Bank because she knows all of the members.  The loan she requested will be used to buy several sacks of compost for her potato crop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":568153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1059,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195451}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T09:47:39Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":218685,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born in 1966, Eunice D. is the mother of three children.

This is the first time she has requested a loan from GHAPE. As she was unable to get investment capital that would help increase her income, she was motivated to request a loan from GHAPE. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she plans to buy three tins of beans seedlings for 195,500FCFA and she will use 30,500FCFA to pay for labor on her farm. She will pay for clearing, hoeing and planting.\r\n\r\nShe thinks the business will succeed because she has been doing this activity for a very long time, she has a plot of land on which to operate and, also, her community will provide a ready market for her beans when they are ready.

He is very satisfied with the loan that this institution has offered him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":649407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To invest in his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Piedras Negras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28.7 -100.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T10:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus Joaquin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5248,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191407840},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826112},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201268346},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206135175},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211207564},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216485881},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221648912},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227016748},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232776076},{"amount":45,"local_amount":525.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":554.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238580495}],"funded_date":"2010-11-24T22:50:19Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:45:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":255569,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma G. is a 50 year old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing business.

She has been living in Setovi, alone with one of her children, for five years. Philomene did not attend school.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for her own needs and to guarantee that her child gets an education, Philomene has been active for about eight years in the retail of various products including rice, beans, canned food, soap and local beverages (the group's other members sell firewood). Philomene purchases her products in Dantokpa, Benin's international market, and sells them in her neighborhood of Setovi.

<em>tontines<\/em>.\u00a0 Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <em>tontines<\/em> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.\u00a0 Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.\u00a0 However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.\u00a0 This has prevented the traditional <em>tontines<\/em> from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.\u00a0 Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM)

is the world\u2019s second largest producer of cocoa. While most of the crop is exported to make chocolate, Abena, 45, uses cocoa pod, baking soda, and palm oil to make soap locally. She sells two main types of soap, Alata and Azuma blow. Alata is a Twi word for Nigerian, because the soap originated from Nigeria. Azuma is a famous boxer. Supposedly this soap can combat any laundry stain like Azuma combats his opponents. \r\n<p>\r\nAbena has 23 years of experience making soap. Her soap is so popular, that every time she makes it, it sells out in about a week. She is requesting a loan so she can purchase more raw materials to make more soap, since people in the market are demanding it. \r\n<p>\r\nOther than expanding her store, Abena is using her profits to complete her home. Currently she lives in a half-built house with her husband and seven children. Most of the rooms are incomplete and uninhabitable. \r\n<p>\r\nAbena is a leader of the lending group, The Believers.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cAmanccay\u201d, is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea-level, in the community of A\u00f1ancusi in the district of Acoria, province of Huancavelica. The name \"Amanccay\" comes from a local flower. The main activities of the population are the growth of corn, potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes), and at lower altitudes of the Mantaro River tropical fruits. Most of the population also have cows, bulls and sheep, and at the higher altitudes llamas and alpacas. In the small town the population have some shops and proviD. several services, but the main commercial activity is on Tuesday, when there is the local market, where most people do business. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan-cycle with currently 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,200 soles (about 1,550 US$). The loans range from 200, 400, and up to 500 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save, except for the initial loan to start. But all agree to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Isabel Ignacia D. L. C. T.. Isabel has a small \u201ccafetin\u201d business where she sells  sweets, sandwiches and soft drinks at the local school. Besides her \u201ccafetin\u201d she sells fruits at local markets. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more things for her business.  Sometimes she kills one of the sheep to sell the meat. Like most people she has a small plot of land where the family cultivates a variety of products and has a small stock of cattle. With FINCA Per\u00fa she hopes to have her own savings to be able to buy a house in a bigger town, to work more enthusiastically and with more responsibility and to receive trainings. And her dream\u2026.. for her son to be a professional!\r\n<p>\r\nAnother story tells Epifania M. Y., who has her own grocery store. With her 500 soles loan she will buy more groceries to fill up her store again. And like Isabel, she also has a small plot where the family cultivates a variety of products and has a small stock of cattle, but mostly for their own consumption. Her dream for the future is to buy a house in Huancayo, one of the major cities in the central Andes, and for her children to be professionals. With her savings she will able to increase business, buying more merchandise and selling more. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more, to receive trainings and to be respected as a woman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":152765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy new supplies for business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-04-28T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina Elda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-14T02:25:48Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-14T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238061},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266935},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296038},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":326599},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":359842},{"amount":260.01,"local_amount":693.35,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":703.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314309}],"funded_date":"2008-04-30T02:25:48Z","paid_date":"2009-01-21T03:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49866,"name":"Adjoagan Lucienne","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Born in 1951 in Lom\u00e9, Mrs. Adjoagan Lucienne A. is separated from her husband who began taking additional wives twenty years ago.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

On weekends she also works at a discotheque near her home as a waitress.  She tells us that the commissions and incentives she gets from the beauty products sales she has bought items for her living room, bedroom, kitchen and dining room.  She also gets items that are on sale of both brands like shampoo, cologne, perfume, etc. and then resells them at a higher price.  This is how she is able to cover household expenses and provide her two children with what they need.\r\n\r\nBesides, Maria tells us that every week she participates in a junta (a collection of money among several persons) that is raffled off on the weekend. She uses that income to buy groceries, school supplies and food for her children.\r\n\r\nThe recent loan that she was granted she will use to buy more stock beauty supplies to increase sales and thus profits.\r\n\r\nShe is happy to be able to participate in this system that supports micro businesspeople like her.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":599951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-16T16:45:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loyda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":662.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390887},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":662.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529167},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":662.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665275},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":662.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408524}],"funded_date":"2010-09-17T20:51:42Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":235089,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita D.

They all now do different kinds of work to contribute to the family financially.\r\n<p>\r\nParveen supports her family financially by sewing  and selling clothes. She mainly gets sewing orders from her neighborhood clients and sells a variety of her clothes to different clothing shops. She also imports clothes from Faisalabad (famous for its textile industry in Pakistan) at cheap rates, and by selling them to different clothing shops she earns a good profit.\r\n<p>\r\nParveen has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner Asasah for her clothing business. She will invest the loan in purchasing clothes of different varieties in bulk quantities. The bulk purchasing will cut  her cost of travelling and also minimize the purchase price. She is experienced in her business and is confident that after investment, her business will improve and she will easily pay back her loan installments.\r\n<p>\r\nParveen is a regular Asasah borrower. This is her fourth loan application. In previous loan periods, she  proved herself a responsible client who never missed any meetings and paid her installments on time.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the photo, the woman who holds a book (called an \u201cAsasah Passbook\u201d) in her hands is Parveen.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":628357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Adem\u00e1s les ofrece trabajo a 4 personas que se encargan de atender a los clientes, como garzonas y las dos personas restantes son maestras de cocina. \nSu anhelo es que se reconstruya Dichato, junto con esto obtener su vivienda propia, ya que a causa del tsunami que asol\u00f3 esa zona el 27 de febrero del a\u00f1o 2010, Leonor qued\u00f3 sin nada, por lo que tuvo que volver a reconstruir su vida y negocio.

Leonor has been making and selling empanadas and pastries for 12 years. Her shop is located in the commercial center of Dichato. However, due to the aftershocks of the tsunami in Japan, high waves devastated the coast of Dichato again, which has lowered the number of visitors and restaurant customers which sought her products wholesale. Despite this situation the weekends attract a lot people.\r\nLeonor lives with her \u200b\u200b4 children, 18, 16, 12 and 8 years of age, who help her in her business either at the cash register or in the kitchen to cook certain products. She also employs four people to serve the customers as waiters and the two remaining people are chefs.\r\nHer dreams are that Dichato will be rebuilt and to obtain her own home because she was left with nothing after the tsunami that struck the area on February 27, 2010 and had to rebuild her life and her business. Currently, she is living with her children in a shack the city of Dichato provided for her. Regarding her business, Leonor intends to have her business independently, to obtain higher profits and build a microenterprise with her children. Her motivations are to provide her children with a better life and to fund their studies.\r\nWith this loan she intends to buy an electric fryer and supplies to make empanadas such as flour, eggs, oil, lard and seafood. \r\nLeonor is very grateful for the loan granted by field partner Fondo Esperanza because of the ease in making payments.

Despite efforts by their loan officer and community members, the child could not be saved.\r\n<p>\r\nWith their first loan, Yecenia and her husband bought tools, two sacks of sugar, and other ingredients necessary to make sugar cane sticks. Using the knowledge gained from his previous employment, Manuel maD. the candy while Yecenia sold it around the neighborhood. With each of their three following payments, Yecenia and Manuel have been able to expand their business to incluD. four more types of candy and a vendor who takes the highway to the center of Santo Domingo to sell.\r\n<p\r\nWith the money they have earned, Yecenia and Manuel have been able to move into a two-bedroom shack that they rent, which is not only bigger, but in a less dangerous location, and they are able to proviD. food for their children. They are saving money right now through the programmed and voluntary loans offered at Esperanza so that they can buy their own house in the future. They have been exemplary in repaying their loans. They have not missed a single repayment date despite various hardships. For example, one particular day, Manuel suffered a heat stroke while making candy. Instead of using the money he was saving to repay the loan to pay for going to the hospital, Manuel repaid the loan and refused to go to the hospital. Friends and community members forced him to go to the hospital and chipped in to help him pay for the bill. Another time they were robbed of their money only days before the loan repayment date, but they somehow managed to make enough money to make their payment.

Sus planes a futuro son de seguir sembrando, adem\u00e1s su madre le propuso traspasarle su tienda, a lo que ha aceptado, y empezar\u00e1 a trabajar en ella para que poco a poco pueda pagarle a su madre el valor de su bodega. Este es su 8vo pr\u00e9stamo consecutivo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo ha trabajado con responsabilidad, y en su cargo de tesorera cumple cabalmente sus funciones, as\u00ed como con cada una de sus cuotas se\u00f1aladas. El dinero que ahora solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes, asimismo para pagar parte del traspaso de la tienda de su madre.","en":"<p>Maximiliana is 20 years old and lives with her partner, the father of her 2 children and they live in her parents' house. This year they have sowed peas, potatoes and yams in her parents' plantation fields. Her husband is responsible for the plowing and preparation of the fields. This type of work is carried out the fields only after they have been rested from cultivation for 2 or 3 years. This down time allows the fields to be very fertile and do not require many additional fertilizers. Maximiliana loves to be a farmer, something she has been doing since she was a little girl and now with the help of her husband her work is much lighter. Her plans for the future are to keep sowing and her mother also proposed giving her the store and she has accepted. She will start working in the store and with time she will be able to pay her mother the value of the grocery store. This is her eighth consecutive loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and all this time she has been participating responsibly. In her role as the treasurer she has been carrying out her duties and she has been making her payments on time. The funds that she is requesting now will be used to purchase fertilizers and some of the money will be used to pay for the handover of the store from her mother.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":306920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":308.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990360}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T20:32:03Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":107245,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is 35-year-old businesswoman.

She is married and has two children.  One of her children is currently in school.  Viola has a business of selling clothes, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Viola has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more clothes.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Viola hopes to generate greater profits and to buy food and clothes for her children.  In the future, Viola hopes to enlarge her business\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:   BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future.

She is married to Severino, age 44, and they have nine children.  They have their own home located along Tupac Amaru Avenue in the District of Kimbiri.  Astria and her husband are the breadwinners of their family.  When Astria was a young girl, her parents taught her how to work on a farm.  She is now a farmer and has five hectares of land on which she plants coffee and pineapples, tropical fruits grown in the Apurimac River Valley.  Astria has worked on her land for 22 years, and during the harvest season she has the help of her children and the labor of workers who can pick the fruit with great speed.  She considers the most difficult part of her job to be transporting her products from the farm to the distribution centers in the city of San Francisco, the place that offers the best prices for grain and pineapples.  Her difficulty is when she lacks sufficient income to pay her workers in advance since they provide assistance during the harvest.  For this reason, she has taken out loans with institutions such as MFP.  Now her highest priority is to plant more pineapples since she has two hectares of land that have not been cultivated.  \n\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  Astria feels the support has helped her greatly in making progress in her work.  In her Communal Bank, she is well-respected by the other members.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she is requesting will be used to hire workers to help with the harvest.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":728259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To hire workers to help with the harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835251}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T11:04:10Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":284284,"name":"Yovanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yovana de 26 a\u00f1os, natural de la comunidad la Libertad anexo del distrito de Quimbiri; esta casada con Alfredo de 30 a\u00f1os de edad y tienen 02 hijas Rosal\u00eda de 09 y  Gressy de 07 meses de nacida y juntos viven en su propio lote a medio construir situado en el distrito de Quimbiri.

With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her recent loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 25,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future, the education of her children, some savings for her family and house repairs. Anita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \u201cHonorable\u201d). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The loan would put fresh life into her business. \r\n\r\nDoris wishes to put the business on a stronger footing, and she hopes that this money will enable her to do that, and at the same time allow her to help her children financially while they are in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":746033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy seafood such as puches, crab, olominas, dried fish, and oysters","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Ozatlan, Usulutan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2011-04-20T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Emelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":28.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.47,"local_amount":27.47,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":27.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211285658},{"amount":28.32,"local_amount":28.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216565674},{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":61.13,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":61.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221735414},{"amount":62.15,"local_amount":62.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":62.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866813},{"amount":147.06,"local_amount":147.06,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":147.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264816},{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":40.7,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263406131},{"amount":33.17,"local_amount":33.17,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":33.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270120666}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T16:53:43Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:48:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":292496,"name":"Carolina Del Fatima","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carolina tiene 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y  reside junto a sus padres y sus tres hermanos en una zona urbana marginal de la ciudad de Chiclayo, una zona bastante comercial que se encuentra ubicada al norte del Per\u00fa.\n\nCarolina se dedica a brindar servicio de enfermer\u00eda para una Cl\u00ednica de la ciudad de Chiclayo, esta actividad la realiza hace 1 a\u00f1o, cuenta con estudios superiores en la Universidad Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo.

Elisabete moved to Namaacha - a village on the border of Swazilandia where her uncle lives.\r\n\r\nElisabete went to school through 5th grade when she had to drop out due to the war, but after moving to Namaancha she is able to continue her studies and started working at OTM (Mocambique's Workers Organization) as a janitor, making 150MT per month. Since her income wasn't sufficient to pay for her living expenses and rent, she found another job at the Namaacha's Graduating Center of School Teachers (CFPPN), today's Granduating Institute of School Teachers (IFPPN), where she still works from 6:30AM until 2:30PM earning 1,800MT per month. With the help of her husband she began building her house and believes that she will be able to move in by mid-next year.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva. The first loan she took in the amount of 10,500MT was used to buy construction materials and this second loan in the amount of 10,500MT will be used for the same purpose. In the future she hopes to take out additional loans to help her paint and furnish her new house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Camila Vasconcelos, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She wants to have a successful business. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began working with this group because they were looking for a loan and a friend talked about Esperanza.

She and her family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent.

Her husband Batsaihan runs a farming business, while Tuya operates a business selling religious items at the local market. They started both businesses in 2007. After years of successful operations, Tuya has managed to increase her working capital of religious items to over 1,000,000 MNT today. For the farming business, they plant various types of vegetables and crops on their own 7 hectares of land. Specifically, they plant wheat on 2 hectares of their land and grass on 5 hectares.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is cheerful and hard-working and lives with her partner, Edgar.  They have two daughters, Luz, 11, and Britney, 9, and all live together in their own home in the Quimbiri District.  Rosa studied cosmetology in Lima.  Her passion for cutting hair was the reason for setting up her own beauty salon in Quimbiri, where she has been in business for three years.  Her salon is very popular since she offers different cuts, hairstyles, manicures and pedicures.  She works from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. with the busiest time being during the months of November and December when graduations are taking place at schools.  During these months she has to hire more personnel to help with haircuts, styling and make-up.  \r\n\r\nShe is very dedicated to her job and, thanks to her hard work, her salon is preferred by many of her customers, which gives her a better income.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy supplies and display cases for her salon.  Her top priority is to open another salon in the San Francisco District so she can become even more popular.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have demonstrated that they can make their payments on time and continue working.  The president is a hardworking woman who is involved in different businesses, including raising ducks and producing varnished furniture.  She is an active woman who is committed to the group.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other members sell cosmetics, produce macram\u00e9 fabrics, manufacture clothing, prepare food, and perform manicures.  The men are involved in public transportation.  Even though they face much competition, the members have loyal customers.  Despite the difficulty of their jobs, they enjoy their work and continue to do so because their families depend on them.  \r\n<p>\r\nTheir loan will be used to increase their supplies for their work as well as acquire attractive merchandise for sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
