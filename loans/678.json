She is married to Orlando L., a factory worker, and they are blessed with one child who is studying in grade school. Rowena makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been managing her own variety store for three years.\r\n\r\nRowena joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) in 2008. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow eight times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used all the money she borrowed as added capital for her store business. Her business now lets her earn a net profit of PHP 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, Rowena would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be used mostly as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying sacks of rice, charcoal, soft drinks and other household commodities for her store.\r\n\r\nRowena dreams that her variety store will continue to grow and become a grocery so that they will have enough savings for the college education of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":455631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Juventud is made up of a group of energetic women who wish to get ahead in life with their families. They have become good friends. All of them live in the metropolis of Cuenca. This city is characterized by its friendly people, scenery and historic center. In general, it's a charming city that attracts domestic and foreign tourists.<p>\r\nRosa E. lives in the metropolis of Cuenca. She is 37 years old, married and has 7 children who are 21, 19, 16, 15, 12, 10 and 1 year old. Her first daughter is married and lives with her, sharing household expenses. Her 19-year-old son lives with his grandmother on the coast. The 16-year-old son works in the 9 de Octubre market in Cuenca, selling clothes and contributing economically although his contribution is small. The 15-year-old and the 12-year-old are still in secondary school. Her husband works as a porter for a company, but only works when they call him. He also works as a wielder as he has the necessary equipment. They don't have their own house so they rent their home.\r\n\r\nRosa works in the assembly and disassembly of stalls for the Wednesday market. On Tuesdays she works from 4am to 6pm. For disassembling the stalls, she works on Wednesdays from 4pm to 12am. She has been doing this for 9 years. Seven months ago she started her own business of raising chickens and she sells them at the market.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRosa is in her second loan cycle. She joined the lending group thanks to her sister-in-law who invited her. She says that she used her first loan to start raising chickens. With the new loan she will buy more chickens and food to continue growing her business bit by bit.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to be able to buy her own land to build a house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Chong, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":473383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a brood of chickens and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-20T16:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Rosa Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074731},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:38Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910714},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946373},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946374},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674685},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674686},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708846},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708847},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892148},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892149}],"funded_date":"2010-01-20T17:07:16Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Chong","image":null}},{"id":173996,"name":"Estrella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estrella A. is from the village of Panduma, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

H. is a merchant from the municipality of Condega and makes a living baking and selling bread. She plans to use the loan to purchase ingredients such as flour and sugar to expand her business. She started baking bread in small quantities and while she was getting to know the trade she was growing her clientele until her business grew to where it is today. Mar\u00eda started the business approximately 15 years ago, and she works Monday through Saturday from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. Her son's wife helps her with the work daily. She hopes that with the loan she can increase her production to cover nearly her entire market. Mar\u00eda is single and has two children who are still in school, which she pays for. This is her 10th loan over a period of seven years, and the loans have helped her successfully make headway with the business since the ingredients can get expensive.

She is 35 years old. Florida is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Florida S.'.\r\n\r\nFlorida is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Florida owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Florida has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Florida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. Florida is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Florida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in Atlacomulco, in the State of Mexico, where the people press forward with great commitment and attitude despite facing various hardships in their daily lives.  The group consists of ten members.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group treasurer is Roc\u00edo E. C\u00e1rdenas.  She is 25 years old and studied through high school.  Unfortunately, she says she had to quit school because of growing responsibilities at home and having to support her family by sewing.  She is single and does not have children, but she is responsible for taking care of her nine siblings together with her mother.  Every day she looks for ways to meet their needs.  She makes tablecloths and napkins that are mainly sold in San Marcos Tlazalpan, Toluca, Mexico City, Santiago Acutzilapan, and Atlacomulco.  Rocio learned how to sew at a young age without realizing that one day this skill would become a source of income.  She always enjoyed sewing and was taught by her mother.  Even though she had a hard time learning how to sew at first, Rocio\u2019s dedication and perseverance resulted in the excellent work she produces today.  She faces many challenges as a result of her weakened eyesight, but fortunately her family helps her with her other jobs.  Upon requesting this loan, Rocio thought about what she would be buy and had always wanted to start a business making linens, so she will use the money to acquire the necessary materials.  She hopes that though her work, her siblings will find better opportunities in other areas of society and experience a better quality of life today.\r\n<p>\r\nThe other group members are:\r\nFelipa N.

Gladis makes nacatamales (a special type of large tamale often sold in Nicaragua), and in addition she sells firewood, beans, ice and soft drinks from her home, all on a cash basis.  She has had this business for more than 5 years.  Her goal in starting the business was to have a secure source of income to support herself and her family.  She learned to always work hard from her mother, who taught her to make nacatamales and sent her and her sisters out into the street to sell.  In this way, she learned how to support herself.

Her husband Antonio Ilustrisimo, who is 49 years old, helps in his wife's business activities.They have 6 children who are 18 to 46 years old with 4 of them having their own family.  \r\n\r\nCalmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Calmelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for the future and become financially stable. \r\n\r\nCalmelita G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado que toda su familia tenga su negocio propio de venta de productos l\u00e1cteos y otras variedades de alimentos, es por ello que juntos preparan el yogurt que es todo un proceso de aproximadamente 60m litros por semana, tienen clientes fijos, como una escuela t\u00e9cnica de polic\u00edas que siempre consumen sus productos por la calidad que han demostrado tener en la producci\u00f3n, esto anima bastante a Rosa que tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en hacer n\u00e9ctares y panecillos, lo que es algo dif\u00edcil por no disponer de un horno panadero, ya que a veces el horno que alquila le env\u00eda los panecillos quemados, por lo que Rosa se ha propuesto implementar su cocina. Es la  cuarta vez que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, demostrando ser muy puntual en sus pagos de devoluci\u00f3n de  capital, adem\u00e1s Rosa tiene gran habilidad trabajar en equipo, como lo hace en su banco comunal. En esta oportunidad, el dinero requerido es para comprar un horno y mejorar su producci\u00f3n de pasteles, as\u00ed como en la elaboraci\u00f3n de los yogurtes y n\u00e9ctares. El horno est\u00e1 valorizado en aproximadamente 2000 soles y  con lo que resta comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de insumos e ingredientes.","en":"Rosa is 42 and lives with her husband and children in a house which they own. Through a lot of hard work, the family has succeeded in building their own business, which sells dairy products and other types of foods. They produce about 60 liters of yogurt every week.  They have regular clients, including a police academy that always selects their products because they know they are high-quality.  Rosa is very inspired by this and now she is also trying her hand at making nectar drinks and baking loaves of bread, which is difficult because she does not have a bread oven. Sometimes the oven she rents burns the loaves, so Rosa is considering installing one of her own. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan Rosa is requesting from MFP, and she has been very prompt with her repayments. Rosa is also very good at working with a team, as she does with her village bank. She plans to use this loan to buy an oven, so she can improve her baking proces, and to support her yogurt and nectar drinks production.  The oven will cost about 2000 soles.  The rest will go toward supplies and ingredients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva

He works for a road construction company operating heavy machinery and has also collected a monthly pension since being discharged from the army. He does not employ any household help and in all he has a monthly income of 4800 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also manages to save some of this income in his bank account.\n\nArtur has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is his 2nd loan, for the amount of 8000 Meticales.

All of them are very enthusiastic. For them, the name of the dream is getting ahead in the businesses they run and doing their best for their loved ones. \r\n\r\nThis is the case with Sonia, who sells vegetables and root crops in the mornings (spinach, potatoes, carrots, peas, corn, limes, lettuce and others) on a well-known and busy street. She tells us that since she was a girl, she accompanied her father when he sold these vegetables at a market. She didn't like this idea very much because she was a bit shy, but her attituD. changed when she went through a separation from her former partner, and due to this, she had to work for the sake of her daughter who was still very young. She did this alone, because her father had died, and this led her to the decision to work as her father had taught her. \r\n\r\nIt was not easy at first, because there were not many buyers, and sometimes the merchandise was ruined because of the national strikes or landslides and mudslides (avalanches) in the area, so that the products she carried from the mountains to the cities were spoiled. However, she persisted and kept working hard until she became well-known in the neighborhood where she sells her products. This has helped her to support her mother and her daughter, whom she tries to give the best education possible. She has bought a small plot of land in a settlement that will soon be constructed. For the moment, she has set up a small wooden house. Having a sales stand of her own is one of her distant goals, which she hopes to achieve with the income from this work. She needs to keep investing in this business to achieve her goals, and it is for this reason that she needs the loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

was born in 1949. He is married and a father of four children who are all above the age of 15. Despite being born into poverty, lacking education, and losing his parents at an early age, Emmanual aims to become a very rich man and give his children the good education they need to get ahead.\t\r\n       E. became a member of GHAPE in 2006 and has successfully repaid two loans. He invested his loans to sell maize and bought a maize mill which produces flour.\r\n\r\nE. started farming crops in 1975, and recently starteed buying and renting a few houses around his neighborhood. In the two years since joining GHAPE, he has dramatically increased his fortunes. His first loan helped him to buy his first corn mill (which costs about 350,000 CFA or $875), and the second loan from Kiva, together with his profits from previous business, helped him to buy his second corn mill. Corn mills are in demand in every community around Bamenda, as corn is sold in kernels and every person must take their corn to be milled before they can prepare \u201ccorn fufu\u201d \u2013 a local favorite. \r\n\r\nI asked E. how he is able to farm and operate mills in two locations, and like a modern-day businessman, he operates from a distance. He pays the rent for two shops in two busy markets and hires two young men to operate the mills. With the two mills now operating, he says he is able to earn as much as 100,000 CFA ($250) per month. \r\n\r\nHis profits from the mills have allowed him to expand his business activities into livestock. Since starting the second mill, he has been able to purchase three piglets and two cattle. His dream for the future is to start a full cattle farm. He says that he already has enough land for a herd of fifty cattle, and he has recently obtained two required grazing permits. A future loan will enable him to begin to build his herd.\r\n\r\nE.\u2019s income allows him and his wife, a civil servant working with the government, to give their four children an enviable education. His eldest is studying in a university in France, made possible in part by a scholarship. Two others are in university in Cameroon. And the youngest is in secondary school. Between the four, E. and his wife pay over 500,000 CFA ($1,250) in annual school fees and expenses. \r\n\r\nE. says that without his new business ventures, he and his wife would really be struggling with the expense of providing their children with such an income. Thus, he is very grateful to those who have financed his loan: \u201cIt is a pleasure to learn that so many around the world are contributing to my family\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d he says, \u201cand we send them our thanks.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe plans to repay this loan in 18 months and the first installment repayment begins four months after

In this business, she still does not earn enough income to support her household.  In order to improve her living, she decided to ask for a loan to buy three piglets to start breeding pigs.  Mrs. Pien H. is a 34-year-old widow with a child that helps the mother's business. \r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans.  Members with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on their loans until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start making payments several months before the end of their loan term, and almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Sanabar is 46 years old. She works purchasing and reselling cows with her children. She has five children. \r\n<p>\r\nSanabar would like to request a loan of $1000 USD for a term of 12 months in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demands. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase additional cows and increase her income further. She plans to use the increased income to fund her children\u2019s education. You could become an important part in Sanabar family's life, and she deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is one of the poorer of the 15 former Soviet republics, with a GDP per capita of less than $600. The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has 8 branch offices throughout Tajikistan, and its entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector, including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

She lives in her own home together with her husband Hugo, 50 years old, and their 4 children. They are the reason for all their efforts. Sarita's work is to harvest carrots, potatoes and sweet peas. She works alongside her husband who has also worked very hard to provide their kids with a good education. She has seen it profitable to go to Bolivia with her products as they become available. That is where she gets the best prices. She makes sure to provide only the best care of her plantations, warding against insects and fertilize as needed.  In time she hopes to increase her productivity so that her sales will be better and her earnings increase. This is her tenth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is committed to making her payments on time, not wanting to cause any problems to her community group colleagues, where she is very well liked. With the two thousand five hundred soles she requests she will purchase more fertilizers for her fields and she will hire the help she needs in the plantations. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":593274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":381.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":395.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":408.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":423.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":438.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":452.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.8},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.36,"local_amount":381.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":383.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154567},{"amount":142.21,"local_amount":395.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":397.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449879},{"amount":147.22,"local_amount":408.97,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":411.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588581},{"amount":152.43,"local_amount":423.4,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":426.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725083},{"amount":157.8,"local_amount":438.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":441.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463183},{"amount":162.98,"local_amount":452.71,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":455.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886589}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T15:44:32Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":231869,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia B. is from the village of Tambagan, Medina, Misamis Oriental.

Talacagay, Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: general store, livestock, and farming. Her husband Fortunato A., who is 58 years old, raises livestock and farms to earn his living. They have 1 child who is already married at 25.\r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell in her General Store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Lolita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

After finishing selling the milk, she tends to her grocery shop business.\r\n  \r\nZubaida has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her dairy business. With the loan, she will buy another buffalo.  That will help her increase the milk quantity and fulfill the demands of more customers. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan investment will help her business grow further and she will be able to provide better facilities in life to her family.

He has been in this business for eight years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his crops from his community to the storage warehouses in the towns of Quimbiri and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOrlando will use the loan he has requested to buy materials with which to refurbish his home.  Over time, he hopes to be able to put together enough money to buy new land so that he can then leave them to his beloved children as an inheritance.  This will be Orlando's first loan and he is very happy to know that he will have the support of each of you and thereby be able to make progress.  He will use his 3,000 soles to buy building supplies with which to refurbish his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":866623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building supplies to improve the infrastructure of his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":206.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":217.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":228.6},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":234.07},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":242.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":255.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":260.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":271.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":278.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":299.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.22,"local_amount":210.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":210.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851308},{"amount":76.7,"local_amount":209.17,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":209.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666492},{"amount":346.97,"local_amount":946.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":946.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385532},{"amount":90.66,"local_amount":247.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":247.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098616},{"amount":91.4,"local_amount":249.28,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":249.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201947},{"amount":202.95,"local_amount":553.51,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":553.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097741},{"amount":214.1,"local_amount":583.9,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":584.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455242}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T13:31:24Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":338432,"name":"Ligia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Despu\u00e9s D. convertirse en madre cabeza D. hogar, Ligia se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar incansablemente para sacar adelante a sus 4 hijos, d\u00eda a d\u00eda se rebusca la manera D. generar ingresos que le permitan mejorar su calidad D. vida, por ello, desD. hace alg\u00fan tiempo se dedica a la cr\u00eda D. cerdos y pollos, y como ingreso adicional venD. arepas a sus vecinos y allegados.\n\nPara continuar con este negocio y esperando ampliar sus clientes, Ligia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar 2 cerdos, cuido para los cerdos y pollos para el engorD.

is a 36 year-old woman from the small town of Monte Mercedes. Her husband\u2019s name is Rogelio Sequec and she has five children. She shows herself to be a very good mother, which is demonstrated by the fact that when she married, she also adopted as her own her husband\u2019s two children from a previous marriage. Of her own five children, four are currently studying. \r\n<p>\r\nShe only made it to third grade and couldn\u2019t continue studying because she had many brothers and sisters. Her father preferred that only the boys study until sixth grade, and she was destined to work in the kitchen with her mother. On occasion, her father would take her to the fields to help out with the corn crop and to do other agricultural work. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was 22 years old, she married and moved to the town of Concepci\u00f3n, Solol\u00e1, which is where she lives now. She works with her family to grow onions and they also have a small store. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Loan:<\/b> Rosita says that being able to invest capital in her business has been one of the best things that has happened to her. She realized that the amount she received almost seven months ago has made a difference in her business. She has been able to supply her store better and her sales have increased accordingly. The amount she is currently requesting is Q. 4,000.00 Guatemalan Quetzals (approx. $450.00).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Dreams:<\/b> When asked about her dreams, she responds with tears in her eyes\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to suffer like I have suffered from not knowing many of the things one learns in school. For this reason, my husband and I have decided to help our children get ahead, so that someday they won\u2019t have to work in the fields like we have had to do, because it is very hard work.\u201d\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>\r\n<p>Rosita, es una mujer de 36 a\u00f1os de edad originaria de la aldea Monte Mercedes, esposa de Rogelio Sequec, madre de cinco ni\u00f1os y demuestra ser muy buena madre ya que cuando se caso tambi\u00e9n adopto como propios a dos hijos de su esposo de un matrimonio anterior, de sus cuatro hijos propios cuatro est\u00e1n actualmente estudiando<\/p>\r\n<p> Ella \u00fanicamente alcanzo el primer grado de primaria pero ya no pudo continuar debido a que eran muchos hermanos y el padre prefiri\u00f3 darles estudio \u00fanicamente a sus hijos varones hasta sexto de primaria y ella fue destinada a trabajar con la madre en la cocina y en ocasiones el padre se la llevaba al campo a trabajar en el calzado de la milpa y algunos otros trabajos agr\u00edcolas<\/p> \r\n<p>A los veintid\u00f3s a\u00f1os se caso y se traslado al municipio de Concepci\u00f3n, Solol\u00e1 en donde vive actualmente y se dedica junto a su familia al cultivo de cebolla, a la administraci\u00f3n de una peque\u00f1a tienda<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>CREDITO: Ella manifiesta que el brindarle un capital para su negocio ha sido una de las mejores cosas que le ha pasado, pues ella se da cuenta que con el monto que recibi\u00f3 hace casi siete meses ha visto un progreso en su negocio, ha podido surtir mejor su tienda y ve que las ventas igualmente han mejorado much\u00edsimo.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase medicines in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T13:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757672},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146766},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984911},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015584},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740590},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773704}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:16:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":157479,"name":"Tsengel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsengel J. is a 21-year-old woman who lives with her parents and two youngest siblings in Bayanhongor Province, one of Mongolia's central provinces.

","en":"The \u201cLas Bendecidas\u201d (The Blessed Ones) is represented by Amparo and made up of 14 members who are in their second loan cycle.  They have shown unity, responsibility and the desire to continue growing to get ahead and make more progress every day.\r\n\r\nAmparo C. P. (group president) has a cosmetics sales business.  Thanks to her efforts, she continues to move forward in her work day to day.  She has two children and is separated from her husband.  Because of this, she overcomes obstacles in order to get her children ahead in life.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a hard-working woman and has shown herself to be very responsible.  She lives under the anticretico modality (a transaction not available in the U.S. whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you) and dreams with having her own home for her and her two children.  Amparo is making a great effort to reach this goal.  She will use the funds as working capital to continue growing in her business.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are multifaceted; they enjoy work very much.  Some sell food; others sell groceries, chickens, soft-drinks and turnovers.  Some sell milk, others vegetables. Some sell maja blanco (a sweet).  In this case, competition is non-existent because they all have different businesses and they all do well because they go out to different points of sale both within the city and to its outskirts in order to sell their merchandise. \r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to increase their ingredients, supplies and products in order to generate better income and meet customer demand.\r\n\r\nThe members already have quite a bit of experience in the field of group loans.  This is an established, very good group.  They completed their first loan cycle well with us and, to date, continue to prove themselves as being very hard-working and responsible people.

She is currently on her 13th loan cycle. She is 41 years old, divorced and the mother of seven children: four of them attend school, one is trained as a mechanic and two are too young to go to school. It is worth noting that she provides only for her children, because her ex-husband has completely left her.\r\n\r\nMasika's business consists of small-scale production of the traditional drink \"Mandrakwa\", which is made from corn with local technology. She began this activity with a start capital of US$60, just after the eruption of Nyiragongo Volcano in January 2002 had destroyed the whole economic infrastructure in the city of Goma. Thus she produced for 8 years \"Mandrakwa\" in her traditional production style.\r\n\r\nShe came to the microfinance institution Hekima and applied for this loan, which she will use to buy 32 sacks of corn to bolster her production capacity and increase her turnover. In addition, she wants to open a small store and buy a minibus for city transportation, since her oldest son has just finished his apprenticeship in automobile mechanics.\r\n\r\nMasika is thankful to MFI Hekima for the loans granted to her without any physical guarantee, because these loans enabled her to provide for her children and gradually build up some savings for her family.\r\n\r\nThis group is composed of 12 members, 11 women and 1 man, all pictured.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":518540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy 32 sacks of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Abdul is 41 years old and married.  He has five children between the ages of 3 and 16 years old.  His oldest four children go to school.  Abdul also supports his 20-year-old sister-in-law, who lives with the family.  Abdul started selling used clothing about ten years ago, and with the help of past loans from Tujijenge Tanzania, he now focuses on selling second-hand shoes.  Abdul has repaid all of his loans, and his business is going well.  He earns a profit of about US$ 150 per month.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul plans to buy about 50 pairs of second-hand shoes for his shop.  He will select men's and women's shoes, sandals and boots.  With the profits, Abdul will continue to support his family and pay for food and school fees.  He hopes to reinvest additional savings into his business, and eventually open up a second location in the busy Kariako market of Dar Es Salaam. \r\n\r\nAbdul is the chairman of the Mpapai group.  The group's 17 members run a variety of businesses including salons, shops, tailoring, and charcoal sales.

In the morning she sells her merchandise in an elementary school.  In the afternoons she does the same work at a high school.  She generally sells dishes of food and sweets during the students\u2019 recess.  She makes these dishes with great care because her main customers are minors.\r\n\r\nThe business is well received, and it is growing.  That is why she believes that it is fitting to expand it with the purchase of more supplies.  Then she could prepare more dishes and increase her sales in order to achieve her goal.\r\n\r\nShe believes that is advisable to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 soles, which will help her meet her objective.\r\n\r\nJuan is a responsible and honest woman.  She has previously worked with our institution, and she has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with her payments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

They have seven children who are 4 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nLeonora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Leonora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fishing vending business and for fishing materials so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs.

She is married to Nonito, a salesman, and has three children. Together they manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEufemia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked meat for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will use it to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEufemia hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work.

Six of her children live on their own and one of her daughters and her grandaughter live at home with her. She has been an agricultural laborer for more than 40 years. During this time she has grown various crops such as potatoes, peas, corn, vegetables and more currently Gladiolus flowers. She will continue to grow these flowers because it has been very profitable for her since she contracted with people in a wholesale market in the capital. She no longer has to wait for May and November when she has the most demand but rather every 15 days she prepares the bales of flowers which have 12 dozen and sell for 20 soles. Feliciana takes between 20 to 25 bales on each trip and, once negotiated, her earnings are very good.  She accumulates an amount of 500 soles including her working capital.  She has since mainly planted flowers without abandoning her other crops.

This is 37 years old Selina L. from Mbozi. She is married   with 2  children, between the ages of 8  and 12. Selina has been running a fish  business since 2004. She owns and operates a small stall from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch, and then roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market on along the roads of the city. Given its location along the water, fish is plentiful in the waters around the city and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet.  She is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of $90.\n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week.  She is requesting a loan in order to purchase fish in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to improve quality and range of product. Selina thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fish in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T14:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757676},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146770},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984915},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015588},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740594},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773708}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T00:22:47Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":157495,"name":"Cristeta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristeta A. is from the village of Bayabo East.

This couple has two sons: David (20) and Javier (17), and they all live in their own home.\r\n\r\nFor the last 20 years, on top of being an excellent farmer, Leonor has been a very capable business woman. In the mornings she sells products from the sierra at the stall she has at a market in the city. After 10 a.m., she helps her husband with his house chores, since they work together both in the fields and in the home. They plant corn, potatoes, peas, and several vegetables that are in high demand in the market. What Leonor likes best is suggesting to her clients what to cook with the produce they buy. On the other hand, she doesn't like people at the market who take advantage of others.\r\n\r\nLeonor seems happy with what she does, but in the future would like to expand her business by offering more products, especially since her sales have gone up thanks to the great customer service she provides. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan Leonor requests from Kiva partner MFP. She is happy with her communal bank, where she tells us she learns from her fellow members' experiences. In hopes of a successful harvest, she will use the loan proceeds to buy several bags of fertilizer, and to invest in her little stall at the market. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":492733,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T05:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886763}],"funded_date":"2010-02-23T12:07:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":182691,"name":"Marleny De La Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marleny De La Cruz M.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto la poblaci\u00f3n busca invertir con proyectos en la misma zona.\nDo\u00f1a Deyanira inici\u00f3 su negocio hace aproximadamente un a\u00f1o. Su objetivo es tener una actividad econ\u00f3mica rentable que no la obligue emigrar a Turrialba a buscar trabajo como empleada dom\u00e9stica. A\u00fan no puede mantener abierto el negocio todo el tiempo que quisiera ya que no tiene suficiente capital como para invertirlo en comprar toda la mercader\u00eda necesaria.

Deyanira comenta que el servicio que ella brinda es muy importante ya que no existe otra pulper\u00eda en la zona. Ella espera que el microcr\u00e9dito le ayude a impulsar su negocio, colaborar con la comunidad y que las personas no tengan que viajar hasta Turrialba para comprar sus abarrotes.\nDeyanira es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA.

She only had one son, and he is grown up and provides for himself. She lives in a small house where she also has her business, a small grocery store, where she sells basic products to her neighbors. The community in which she lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. It is a small, rural town with two thousand inhabitants. They work primarily in milk production and coffee farming. It has a hilly topography and most of the area is maintained as tropical rainforest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine the tropical forest with pretty ponds, coffee plantations, and dairies.\r\n\r\nEl Sauce is located approximately one-and-a-half hours by bus from Turrialba, the nearest center of commerce. However, several times per year the road becomes impassible due to the rains. This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest challenges for the community. When there weren\u2019t many jobs, many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or in banana plantations located on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Lately the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so now people from the area are looking for ways to invest in projects there. Deyanira began her business approximately one year ago. Her goal is to have economically feasible work so that she won\u2019t have to emigrate to Turrialba to work as domestic help. She still can\u2019t keep her business open as much as she would like because she doesn\u2019t have enough capital to invest in all of the necessary merchandise. She explains that having the business in her home means she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent or construct a building, which helps her move ahead with her business. \r\n\r\nWith the micro-loan she has requested, she hopes to buy more merchandise to sell and thereby grow the business and provide better service to her neighbors. Specifically, she will buy basic grocery goods, such as rice, beans, vegetables, canned goods, soft drinks, soap, and everything else that rural Costa Ricans typically need. Deyanira has commented that the service that she provides is very important because there is no other small grocery store in the area. She hopes the micro-loan will give momentum to her business and help her to collaborate with the community so that people won\u2019t have to travel to Turrialbla to buy groceries.  \r\n\r\nDeyanira is a client of the Producers Assocation of El Sauce, a local partner organization of the microfinance organization EDESA. Because of her ties to this organization, she has obtained several micro-loans for her business, which she has repaid satisfactorily. The amounts have increased from US$200.00, to US$550.00, to US$600.00. She currently needs a loan of $1,000.00 to buy the merchandise that is necessary to grow her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

Anita has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Anita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Anita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The members sell perfume, earrings, necklaces, pots, napkins, pastries and toys.  During their time with Emprender they have participated in 6 loan cycles; the founding members of the bank have remained, and they have expanded their membership by 10 percent.\r\n\r\nSenora Rosse Es is the leader, president, and one of the founding members of the bank.  This is her 6th loan cycle, and she is taking on the position of bank president.  She has been a merchant since she was very young; she sells jewelry and other miscellaneous items, including cosmetics.  She has 3 daughters; the middle daughter helps her with the sales.  Her husband does not generate much income, and for this reason she must continue to work to support her family so that she can help her husband so that the family lacks for nothing in the home, and so that she can proviD. support for the education of her children so that in the future they can have a profession and a better economic situation.  Her participation in the group came about thanks to her companions who invited her to join the group.\r\n\r\nThe loans they obtained were invested in their capital and were also used to allow the members to travel to sell in markets in other regions of the country such as Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nPatricia is one of the organizers and founders of a group that evolved into the communal bank Nueva Luz; she has worked with Emprender for 3 years.  She is the treasurer of the bank, and is one of the most dynamic members of the group; she has been very demanding of the other members during the time she has been with the group.  \r\n\r\nPatricia sells a variety of products (jewelry and other consumer goods) with her cart.  She travels with her products to markets and fairs to sell her goods.  She works with her husband in this business.  She has 3 daughters; her oldest daughter is 12, and the younger ones are 8 and 3 years old.  The loan she obtained helped her substantially in being able to improve the economic status of her family, and to proviD. a better life for her children, as she was able to generate an increased income by increasing her working capital. \r\n\r\nPatricia will use this loan to invest in the purchase of a store or sales post in one of the markets.  Her wish is to be able to have her own home and a store.  She hopes that these dreams will become reality in the future.  \r\n\r\nCristina Es, one of the founders of the bank, currently sells cosmetics, socks, rings, wallets and other items from a cart.  Cristina is an enterprising woman who supports her 2 daughters on her own.  She came to know the financial institution Emprender thanks to her companions, who invited her to become part of the group.  In this way she was able to access a loan, which helped her to increase her merchandise.  This was a great help to her, as thanks to the loan, she was able to pay for the education of her daughter who is in school.  In addition, Cristina makes quilts and bed sheets by hand in her free time.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have provided in granting this loan.

Her business of making and selling bridal bouquets is conducted based on orders she receives from specialty stores that sell formalwear and accessories to brides.  When necessary, her children (ages 18 and 17) help with the assembly of the bridal bouquets.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Julia replied that she enjoys the savings, the training, and the health services she receives at the clinic."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":640696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase bedspreads & beauty products to sell during the holidays","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-11-17T16:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alvina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah Otilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gertrudes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10101,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1010.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1009.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":435.01,"local_amount":3030.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3049.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747060},{"amount":290,"local_amount":2020.24,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2032.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485240},{"amount":290.01,"local_amount":2020.24,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2032.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912088},{"amount":290.11,"local_amount":2020.96,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202161050},{"amount":144.87,"local_amount":1009.2,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206221188}],"funded_date":"2010-11-19T11:15:12Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":252413,"name":"Teodosia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Teodosia, de 42 a\u00f1os, convive con Isa\u00edas, de 38 a\u00f1os.

They have 6 children, 5 of whom still live with them, in the house they own in the town of Sanchirio del Palomar (in a forested region of central Peru).  This hard-working woman has operated a farming business for 8 years.  She grows avocados and platanos, but her coffee crop is her main source of income.  She has 4 hectares of land that produce a good grade of coffee bean and she wants to find other markets where she can get mO. money for her crop.  She now goes to the city of Tarma once a month where she sells to a wholesaler, Sra. Gladys.  She wants to sell her crop in the capital in the future because she thinks she can get a better price there and, in turn, expand her business.  This is Teodosia's first MFP loan and she is sure that--with help from her community bank--she can meet the goals she has for the farm.  She will use the loan to buy 6 sacks of organic manure for her coffee crop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":651451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies for farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1053,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850467}],"funded_date":"2010-12-02T23:44:38Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":256509,"name":"Marcos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl socio pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPATRON  DE SANTIAGO\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nEl socio es el Sr. Marcos; el tiene 43 a\u00f1os de edad y es conviviente y tiene 2 hijos; el negocio que tiene el socio es un taller de mec\u00e1nica  el cual se encuentra ubicado en su casa, la ocupaci\u00f3n del socio es mec\u00e1nico automotriz el socio es una persona muy entusiaste y de esta forma el socio saca a su familia adelante.\n\nEl socio solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para los estudios de su hija y para la implementaci\u00f3n de su negocio, el socio comprara aceite de autos,pintura para carros entre   otros.\n\nEl socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n\n","en":"Marcos, 43, is a member of the \u201cPATRON DE SANTIAGO\u201d communal bank located in Cusco district which is part of Cusco province, Cusco department.\r\n\r\nHe has a live-in partner and two children.
