She is married with two children; her husband is a driver in the eastern market and together they have been able to build a good, concrete home but they have not yet plastered the walls nor put in a floor.  They would like to make these improvements soon to provide a better environment for the customers of their small store which they run out of their home.  They sell a variety of products including fruit and vegetables.  \r\n\r\nThey started the business with money she saved from her prior work; she went to work in Spain as a housekeeper to earn more money to finish her home but it was a difficult time for her since she was away from her family and she worked long hours.  Nonetheless, she is happy that she accomplished her goal because in our country there is a lot of unemployment and housekeepers don't earn much especially given how long they work but people do it because they have to.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to purchase a pig, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children, and as additional capital for her existing businesses. Rema C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has also planned to help their relatives so that they will become successful someday.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, she is applying for PHP 35,000 which will be utilized as additional capital for her business (funeral home). She wants more capital because there are times when she has customers who can\u2019t afford to buy a coffin in cash. As she is very considerate, she lets her customers pay for the items in installments and that is why she really needs rolling capital.\r\n\r\nShe is now more dignified because there are institutions like ASHI and its field partner KIVA which believe and trust in her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":647438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Randy earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. His store is located adjacent to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. He will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nRandy hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to support his child's schooling up to college level. He faithfully meets with his co-fellowship* members to share stories of his work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Blanca and her husband provide for their children.\r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Blanca worked on her parents' land.  Now she is really knowledgeable about agricultural work.  She is a farmer and has a plot of land where she grows cacao plants and other native rain-forest plants.  She has been working for 25 years and, at harvest time, she has the support of her children and laborers who help her to pick her fruit more quickly.  What she most enjoys about her work is harvesting her fruit as this is when she feels that the months of hard work are providing their reward, in the quality of her fruit.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her products from the farm to the warehouse centers which are located in the town of Santa Rosa.  This is where they offer her the best price for her produce.  Right now, Blanca's main priority is caring for her cacao by weeding and fertilizing her crops so that she can enjoy better harvests.\r\n\r\nThis will be Blanca's eighth loan from MFP and she is happy to know that she will, once again, have financial support.  She pledges to continue making her repayments punctually through her community bank.  Blanca will use her 1,000 soles to buy manure with which to maintain her crops.  She will use the rest to hire laborers to weed her clearings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":946072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of manure and to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T11:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1011,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400832}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T13:44:07Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":374985,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is married and has two children aged six and twelve.

Solol\u00e1, Nahual\u00e1, San Pedro, San Pablo and some of the women travel even as far as Quetzaltenango which is three hours away. \r\n<P>Most of the women are working very hard and own two businesses. The group leader Simona S. says: many of us have a plot of land where they grow fruits and vegetables and raise some animals too. So do I. We sell our fruits in the markets ourselves. During the evenings we work on the beautiful regional embroideries. And some of us have a food store where they sell the bread they bake themselves. One of the women even has a little business making canastas: the baskets that all of the women use T. bring their products T. the market \r\nWorking with the trust bank has given them the opportunity T. improve their living standards. This is because now they can have access T. clean water and electricity. The women share a lot of their ideas in how T. run their business at the weekly meetings. This way they help each other. \r\n<P>During their childhood many of these women could not attend school, and illness and hygiene were crucial problems. However, nowadays their kids have better opportunities and are doing well in school. If we support these women and their respective families together we are helping them, their communities and Guatemala T. develop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":188662,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase

Two years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. \r\n\r\nShe is engaged in this business together with her husband.  Slowly, the number of cows has increased and, with that, her clients started asking for more and more.  With an endless list of requests she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and, for this reason, she is requesting a loan. \r\n\r\nBe an important part of the growth of Radjabmo\u2019s business.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been a franchise dealer of Natasha, MSE and AVON cosmetic products. She has been able to build her clientele because, she believes, she is approachable to everyone. At times, she has not been able to pre-order some of her customers\u2019 order requests due to a lack of funds. For this reason, she would like to take a loan in the amount of PHP7,000. She will use the loan to purchase more products to sell to her customers. Her monthly net income from the business is around PHP5,000, which is used for the children\u2019s education.

does not yet have children.  Recently, his parents decided to separate his household and suggested that he should start a small business.

","en":"Umeda K. was born in 1981.  She is married and has 2 children.  She has a secondary education.  When she finished school, her parents were unable to send her to a university.  She got married a year later and stayed home.  Umeda\u2019s husband worked as a driver at that time and then switched jobs.  Now he does home remodeling and repairs.  Umeda decided to start selling small items.  She wanted to expand her business a bit and borrowed from her mother.  With time, she started selling shoes.  She bought a small stock of warm slippers in the winter and a stock of flip flops and slippers in the spring and summer.  Having found out about financing from her neighbors, Umeda decided to increase her goods turnover.  She talked it over with her husband and liked the lending terms.  After receiving the credit from Kiva, she bought summer shoes.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":347498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of summer shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-07-15T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umeda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":122.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":126.4},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":130.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":135.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":140.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":145.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.85},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.53,"local_amount":122.13,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":134.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63216077},{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":126.4,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":139.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645543},{"amount":32.71,"local_amount":130.83,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":143.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085150},{"amount":33.85,"local_amount":135.41,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":148.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001371},{"amount":35.04,"local_amount":140.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":154.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846509},{"amount":36.27,"local_amount":145.08,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":159.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737455}],"funded_date":"2009-07-15T23:25:41Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":124161,"name":"Kudirat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kudirat is business oriented and sells shoes.

What she needs to buy is a refrigerator because it is a necessity for her business that will help her generate more profits from her future sales. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":377270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3350,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Mirope","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jasmin Yrene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milagros Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfredo Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2462.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2462.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2462.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2462.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":837.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":837.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":837.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":837.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":2462.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2479,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027504},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":2462.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2479,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939330},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":2462.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2479,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780170},{"amount":837.5,"local_amount":2462.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2479,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669037}],"funded_date":"2009-09-23T02:36:38Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":136496,"name":"Raquel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Raquel es socia del Bancomunal un Nuevo D\u00eda, es conviviente, tiene 50 a\u00f1os y 7 hijos de 32, 30, 22, 19, 18, 16 y 12 a\u00f1os.

She is a leading specialist in a social fund. Her husband works as a driver for a company.\r\n\r\nKulazia and her husband have raised three children. The eldest and the middle sons, 28 and 26 respectively, have taken after their father and work as drivers. The little daughter, 24, is a saleswoman. She is also getting distant education at university.\r\n\r\nIn modern times it has become quite disadvantageous to restrict oneself to have only one occupation. Kulazia is fortunate as fifteen years ago her little brother gave her eldest son a milk cow as a present. Kulazia started to look after the cow even though she was working at that time. Her little brother, having experience in raising livestock, showed them how to look after the cow since neither Kulazia nor her husband has ever looked after cattle before. Even now, her little brother still helps Kulazia look after the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, during these years, Kulazia has managed to increase their total cattle population. From time to time she would sell some of her cattle to make repairs to her house and to buy some convenience goods.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Kulazia hopes that she will be able to obtain this loan to buy one more milk cow to sell more milk and increase their cow population. One of her projects for the near future is to start building a big house.\r\n\r\nThe following people are Kulazia\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nAnarkul, 46, works in a social fund. She needs a loan to buy a calf. According to her, cattle are a good asset to help her children get on their feet.\r\n\r\nBubusaira, 60, is a widow and is the mother of three children. She needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nAzamat, 29, is married and has a two-year-old son. He works as a taxi-driver and needs a loan to purchase tires.\r\n\r\nSurakan, 47, is a widow. She works and raises cattle. She needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nKulchoro, 41, trades in various goods. He needs a loan to purchase office supplies to expand his assortment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<br>This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<br>Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She has been engaged in this business for almost four years and upon starting it, she only sold banana cue (a fried-banana dish). Her sari-sari store earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month.\r\n\r\nNorma joined PMPC, a Kiva partner, to access financial support and to improve her living situation. She successfully repaid her previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. Now she is requesting a loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used for the expansion of her sari-sari store and to buy additional inventory. She wants to save for their future and to live a more comfortable life.

M. is married and has 5 children. She lives in Kariobangi South, an area characterized by informal settlements located within the Eastern part of Nairobi. Here, she sells vegetables and cereals to help provide for her family. She is a born-again Christian and a very committed member of her local church located within her neighborhood. She is the chairlady of the women\u2019 fellowship in her local church where, besides giving spiritual nourishment, they empower women in the church economically. Her husband is involved in casual jobs from which he gets little wages. \r\n\r\nIn order to supplement the family income, Tabitha started her business by selling vegetables in small quantities way back in 1997. Previously, she would knit cardigans and sell them at Ksh 500 and this is how she was able to make savings to start off her vegetable and cereal business. With time, she made considerable progress and moved from selling the vegetables from the ground where she arranged them, to constructing a kiosk, from where she now sells her products. Apart from the vegetables that she sold, Tabitha also introduced a range of cereals. However, due to the limited capital she has, she only manages to buy in measures of quarter sacks, and these only last for about two days, after which she has to buy additional stock. \r\n\r\nTabitha now wants to take her business a notch higher and therefore wants to purchase the cereals in full sacks. This will increase her profit and will enable her to retain her customers who sometimes come to buy cereals but  find them out of stock. She is requesting for a loan of USD 400, which will be given in kind, to purchase the stock of cereals, including beans, peas and rice. The loan repayment period will be 12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":76446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchased assorted cereals including  beans, peas and rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kariobangi South, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.266667 36.883333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-10-19T18:25:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-02T20:04:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:22:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97895},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116398},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136246},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158969},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183732},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211307},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239464},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268434},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":297615},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328211},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":361989},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5278917}],"funded_date":"2007-10-19T20:04:30Z","paid_date":"2008-12-15T18:04:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":7,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25850,"name":"Mahbuba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"D.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":227672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more vitenge and wool in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-20T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melithe N.

His wife is a teacher at a well-known religious middle school. Burkhon has a business of selling women's clothing and towels. \r\n\r\nHe starts his work day in the early hours of the morning by receiving vendors, verifying orders and checking the quality of the products. He is very demanding when it comes to the merchandise he will sell as he does not want his clients to receive defective or unsuitable products. During the day Burkhon receives several orders and attends to his business. \r\n\r\nHis children help their father in their spare time. He wants to instill in them a work ethic from a young age. Burkhon also helps them with their homework as he knows that the most important thing in this stage of their life is an education. This man loves his family and wishes all the best for them; he is a responsible father and a dedicated husband. \r\n\r\nBurkhon wants to keep succeeding in his business by expanding his stock. He wants to stock a greater variety of products so that his clients do not have to go to other businesses to buy what he does not have in stock. That is the reason that he applied to IMON for a loan of 4800 Somoni.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 51 years old. Estarlita is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Estarlita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Estarlita has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Estarlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estarlita is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Estarlita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She earns her living by operating wood lamination and food vending businesses. Her husband Lemuel, who is 39 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 5 and 12 years old. Teofila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teofila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

Lucio es  el sost\u00e9n de su familia, desde muy ni\u00f1o sus padres le inculcaron a remover la tierra y hoy es todo un conocedor de la ardua labor en el agro; es campesino y cuenta con 04 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivado con caf\u00e9, cacao y hojas de coca. Viene removiendo la tierra hace 21 a\u00f1os en sus propias parcelas, en tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de sus hijos y  peones quienes se encargan de cosechar y trasladar los frutos hasta los puntos de secado. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos.

This hardworking gentleman is in a common law marriage with Valentina, age 45, and they have two children, Ronald (age 18) and Roel (age 16).  They live in their own home in the District of Quimbiri.  Lucio is the breadwinner of the family.  As a young boy, his parents taught him how to plow the soil and now he knows about the hard work that is required for farming.  He has four hectares of land on which he grows coffee, cacao, and coca leaves.  Lucio has been cultivating his own land for 21 years and receives assistance from his children during harvest time.  He also hires workers who are in charge of picking and drying the crops.  What he enjoys most about his job is harvesting his crops because he feels that producing quality output is his reward for months of hard work.  He considers the most difficult part to be transporting his products from the community of Quimbiri Alto to the collection centers in the Districts of Quimbiri and San Francisco.  These places offer the best prices for his products.  The loan he is requesting will be used to buy wood to remodel the fa\u00e7ade of his house by replacing the planks that have deteriorated with new ones.  Now his highest priority is to cultivate coffee since there is greater demand from foreign markets.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Lucio\u2019s first loan with MFP and he is willing to complete his payments so that he can access subsequent loans.  He is grateful that the institution has approved this loan.  With the 2500 PEN he requested, Lucio will purchase wooden planks to replace the ones that have deteriorated and improve the fa\u00e7ade of his house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The couple have four children and live in Puerto Mayo community, in Pichari district.  Edith remembers that she started out farming when she was still a girl, on her parents' farm.  She spent most of her time sowing and harvesting products such as cacao and coffee.  Edith saw an opportunity.  She saw that cacao was in great demand and so started setting out her own plantations.  She then started farming independently from her parents after having thanked them profusely for the training that they had given her.\r\n\r\nEdith currently produces cacao in large volumes which provides her with a good profitability.  For this reason, she tries to protect her main source of income from any pests that appear and she normally receives help from her partner.  However, during harvest season, she needs help from laborers who make it easier for her to pick her produce efficiently and effectively. \r\n\r\nThis is Edith's second loan from MFP.  She pledges to be punctual in making her loan repayments so that she can ensure she is able to take out further loans in the future.  She will invest her 1,000 Peruvian soles in having her cacao plants pruned.  Edith is happy to be a member of her community bank because all the members are very supportive of each other."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":804882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers to prune and weed her cacao plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-07T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1032,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712696}],"funded_date":"2011-07-08T04:23:52Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":317615,"name":"Edison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edison is 29 years old and lives in San Gabriel in northern Ecuador.

He has been a farmer for the past eight years, having learned rice farming from his parents. \r\n\r\nHe will use the Kiva loan to help pay for labor costs during rice production: nursery, transplanting, field management, guarding birds, and finally in harvesting activities. \r\n\r\nWith the profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will increase his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

H. is married and the mother of 5 children, of whom two are enrolled in school. She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Wangnime of Hetin Sota, located near the  hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells smoked fish.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Jos\u00e9phine D. H. has requested a loan of 110,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":237970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-01-13T05:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":13750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821573},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357845},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046895},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938513},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396176},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":29025.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904056},{"amount":28.14,"local_amount":13750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-21T07:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":14512.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126064}],"funded_date":"2009-01-13T07:59:20Z","paid_date":"2009-08-21T07:46:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83233,"name":"Lumanai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lumanai M., 41, is married with 5 children.

At the end of this season she will sell women's shoes, thus making the most of each and every opportunity and customer request.  Nancy delivers the merchandize to her clients, and then gradually collects their payments until the bill is paid in full.  She has had positive results from her business, and that encourages her to continue working.  This work permits her to be home with her children in the afternoons.

He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Perlita has been engaged in her business for over 24 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Perlita joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Mwajab of Twisakilala Group, Jinja, is 38 years old and has, for the last four years, been in charge of a business selling secondhand clothes in Wakitaka, Jinja. With profits from this business she has, to a certain degree, managed to elevate her family\u2019s welfare.\r\n\r\nWhat has been of paramount importance to Mwajab all these years has been hard work. Her amiable personality has also played so much into her favor as this has gotten her many friends who in turn have turned into clients.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, Mwajab was selling timber which she still does, albeit on a small scale.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He went to school until the fifth grade and fulfilled his compulsory military service.  He is divorced and the father of six children between the ages of 27 and 11 years.  The three eldest are already employed and supporting the three younger, who are still in school.\r\n\r\nAfter completing his compulsory military service, Inacio was transfered to Maputo, where he worked in the PRM (Police of the Republic of Mozambique), and in the following year married his wife.  In 1987 he was transfered to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland.  As he was already in conflict with his wife at that time, Inacio divorced her, leaving her with the house and children, and came to live alone in Namaacha in a house provided by the State.  He got a permanent position as a residence officer at 29 years old.  He works 24 hours a day, three days a week, earning a monthly salary of 5853 meticais, and has a military pension of 4558 meticais.  He supports his three children, sending them a monthly allowance of 1000 apiece, and every three months he sends 3000 meticais to his mother in Cabo Delgado.  He doesn't manage to save anything by the end of the month because he is building his house there in the village.\r\n\r\nThis is Inacio's third loan, his second through Hluvuku, and his first with Kiva.  His first loan was with the BIM (International Bank of Mozambique), to launch his construction work.  It was for 40000 meticais, and he repaid it in three years.  In 2007, he became acquainted with Hluvuku through a friend and requested a first loan in the amount of 12000 meticais, which he used to buy construction material to continue the construction project.  He was able to repay that loan ahead of time.  He requests this second loan to finish the construction.  Once he repays this loan, he plans to request another, for furnishing his home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a time when families show their unity and exchange gifts to brighten up this beautiful period.  In the Campito neighborhood, in the city of Barranquilla and all over Colombia, this is a crucial commercial moment, being the most favorable for the smaller businesses since they are located in residential areas close to families.  As a result, they successfully have a constant turnover of merchandise.  Harleth's idea of starting this shop was encouraged by her mother, a beloved tailor in the Campito neighborhood.  Realizing that she wouldn't be able to continue her studies further, she had to find a way to earn money to support and raise her young son, which is what she is currently doing.  Harleth is applying for her first loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo because she needs an investment of work capital in her business, especially during this time when her sales will increase, if and only she has everything that her clients need.  With this credit, she will purchase a variety of merchandise, specifically toys and other seasonal items, such as gifts, clothes, and cosmetics that would embellish her business and the families that

There he started his family together with Natalia, his wife of 9 years.  The couple have two children: Cintia and Angie, who they care for in their own home.  This young father's work is 'farming'.  It is his main business activity.  Growing coffee on his 3 hectares of farmland is what he most enjoys doing because he has 10 years experience in caring for and growing this crop.  He has also seen how, over the last few months, the price per kilo for coffee beans has risen considerably.  This year he will sell his produce to the \u201cCaf\u00e9 Monta\u00f1a\u201d and \u201cBio Azul\u201d cooperative where he hopes to obtain good profits.  However, as he is aware that his coffee harvest only happens once a year, he also works providing a public transport service with a vehicle that he rents.  He covers routes from Pichanaki to Puerto Sotani.  His work is going very well but this year he would like to buy a vehicle of his own which he can also use when transporting his harvest from his farmland to the city. \r\n\r\nJuan belongs to the \"Los Clavelitos de Shakivironi\" community bank and this is his third loan from MFP.  He hopes to receive your cooperation in helping him reach his goals.  For his part, he pledges once more to make his loan repayments on time as he has done with his previous loans.  Juan enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nJuan, with your support, will invest the money he has requested by adding it to a sum of money he already has in order to buy a vehicle called a 'torito' (a type of motorcycle taxi which is used for public transportation)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":804941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy a vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-08T13:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3027.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098507}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T09:30:39Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":317647,"name":"Felix","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e9lix, es un hombre valiente y trabajador, tiene 37 a\u00f1os; que junto a su esposa Dina, cuidan de sus 3 menores hijos; Fresia, Frank, y Denis.

is Leah, 42, a resident of Taguig City, Philippines. Her husband is Roderick, an overseas contract worker. She is the mother of one child. She manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLeah operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the item. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 700 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 50,000-PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLeah hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship* co-members to share stories of her work every week, where she can draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":928505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Scolar is a friendly member of the community with two children. Scolar lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nOmalo Koth village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Kojwang well. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Scolar\u2019s family and the 27 other households using the local water source need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nScolar has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Scolar volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to help the community access safe water, this reducing water-borne diseases. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Rose, Ann, Rose and Caleb.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Scolar\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Scolar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caleb ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":937220,"name":"Jlg-003-Melapatti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kanniyammal is a 40-year-old, married woman.

Her long term plan is to have salespeople who can sell her products, and to be able to teach others in her family this trade so they can inherit it and continue with the business.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":216918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase the ingredients she needs to increase production and sales of the local snacks she makes and sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-11-04T06:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T17:06:07Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893429},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816506},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351211},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038533},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928834},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383760}],"funded_date":"2008-11-04T17:06:07Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T20:21:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":75073,"name":"Habib","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Habib is a 60-year-old man who lives in Saida, in southern Lebanon, with his wife and their three children. \r\n\r\nHabib owns a grocery shop where he sells vegetables and candy.

Shuhradjon makes a living is the breeding of livestock. He started this business eight years ago with a small number of livestock, but as his business has developed, he has acquired greater quantities of animals for their eventual sale and gain from their derivatives. \r\n<p>\r\nAccording to Shuhradjon, he works very hard so that he can maintain his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve the lives of his family. Currently Shuhradjon needs a loan of $800 in order to purchase more cattle and later resell them after breeding them. This will allow him to fully meet the needs of his family and educate all of his three children.   \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Boca Chica is known for having white soft sand, and the water is calm, clear and shallow. But tourists don\u2019t normally see those that are trying to survive in the nearby communities. Especially now in the down-turning economy many are left without employment because businesses keep on shutting their doors. Dernita has been able to survive because 13 years ago she started her own business. She sells clothes and basic food products from her house. Currently her colmado sells rice, beans, sugar and flour, but does not sell fruits and vegetables. With this loan she hopes to attract new customers by expanding to also sell fruits and vegetables. \r\n\r\nPrior to 2006, when she was still not an Esperanza client, Dernita realized that a lot of the time when she found herself out of money to re-stock she would borrow money from local lenders. The local lenders charge a 20% interest rate per week! Esperanza charges a 2% declining-balance interest rate every two weeks, 4% a month. Esperanza also helps its clients with complimentary services such as savings account, medical and life insurance, literacy courses, and business management training, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nPlease strongly consider loaning to Dernita and her group. She deserves a fair interest rate and an opportunity to grow her business. Esperanza thanks you for your time and consideration.

Bernadette has lived in the Oganla area of Porto-Novo for ten years. Married to Armand Dandjinou, a retired teacher, Bernadette is the mother of four children, all in school, of whom two are in her care. Bernadette lives together with her husband and children. Bernadette attended school up to the secondary level. For about two years, Bernadette has sold kitchenware (iceboxes, plate sets, drinking glasses) through the distribution system. It is in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, and at the Ouando market in Porto-Novo, that Bernadette gets her supplies.

The members are merchants selling a variety of food products:  Rebeca M. and Juana G. sell tacos; Sotera G., Eustolia V. and Ricardo S. sell breakfasts in a school; Oralia S. hand knits napkins to sell; Teresa T., Carmela L. M. and Eustolia G. sell tamales; Ofelia S. sells Totopos (corn chips); Maria L. sells dinners (prepared meals and snacks like: sopes (fried tortilla dough circles topped with various toppings), enchiladas, tacos, empanadas).\r\n\r\nMaria L. G. is married and has three children; they are 9, 12, and 14 years of age.  She decided to sell food because this is something she has done for many years.  She now has her own work place and the loan money that she has requested from the Foundation will be used to buy building materials and supplies like: cement, sand and whitewash and to pay labor costs to enlarge her eatery because she wants her customers to be comfortable when they come.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she likes working with her fellow group members because she knows all of them and trusts that they won\u2019t have any problems repaying the loan because they are all hard-working and good payers.\r\n\r\nShe also hopes that Kiva lenders will continue to support the Foundation so that they can continue to receive the benefits that credit represents and to help their businesses grow.  She also asked that we send their appreciation to all those who lend money to Kiva and that don\u2019t forget them.\r\n\r\n  \r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

The milk products are in demand in his village and his orders for them are very high but the milk his cows give is not enough for the traders, so he decided to apply for $3000 USD to purchase an additional cow and fodder as well as seeds and fertilizer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 46 years old. Shirley is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Shirley owns and operates a general store. She decided to restart her typical retail store in their village, and plans to sell food and daily use products. She hopes that generous Kiva lenders will grant her loan to use as additional capital in her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Shirley joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirley is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Shirley from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The municipality is very close to Rio Magdalena, the longest river in Columbia and the primary source of water in the country. He has a stand where he sells beef meat, tripe and fish, as well as various other merchandise such as dresses and accessories. In this village he lives with his wife and their three children, aged between 13 and 20 years of age. \r\n\r\nManuel initially sold tripe and beef meat to his family but later he started selling to his closest neighbors. He later refashioned a table in his living room to store fish, a product that was highly sought out by his clients. Clients from other districts started to buy from him, given the high quality of his meat products. He has gradually expanded his business. This is the second loan he seeks through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). He will be able to provide his clients a better service. Prior to this he had very little capital to work with. His goal is to set up a store from where to sell meat products and in the future he would like to move his business to the downtown core of the village. He requests a loan to purchase greater quantities of meat from the butchers to supply his ever growing roster of clients. His dreams are to improve his business, and improve his earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva
