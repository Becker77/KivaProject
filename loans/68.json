For one year she has sold cosmetics by catalog and eventually she began also selling sheets and household items. This small business helps her to cover the costs of education for her son and to help her parents cover the daily household economic expenses, since they are elderly and cannot work anymore. \r\n\r\nShe desires to create a small store where she can sell the products that she usually offers in a more permanent way.

Some of the difficulties he faces are his health and the competition. \r\n<p>With the loan he wants to purchase tools to increase his business further, and in a future he wants to create an ironworks workshop branch for his son.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cecilia Piris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":465027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-01-06T20:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":71.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.39,"local_amount":61.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":61.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910074},{"amount":71.17,"local_amount":71.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":71.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945639},{"amount":71.66,"local_amount":71.66,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674002},{"amount":73.8,"local_amount":73.8,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":73.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708162},{"amount":75.36,"local_amount":75.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":75.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891362},{"amount":77.48,"local_amount":77.48,"processed_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":77.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631623},{"amount":79.25,"local_amount":79.25,"processed_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":79.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845515},{"amount":89.89,"local_amount":89.89,"processed_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":89.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111808}],"funded_date":"2010-01-07T04:21:19Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cecilia Piris","image":177981}},{"id":171035,"name":"Julievi's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julievi B. is from the village of Biray in Ozamiz City.

Julievi is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase the ingredients that she needs to make products to sell. This will be Julievi's first loan from GDMPC.

She supports her family by operating a used clothing business and a tricycle transport business. She lives in Maasin, Brookes Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her used clothing and tricycle transport businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. \r\n\r\nLilybeth is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can continue to purchase more stocks of used clothes to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lilybeth aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

G. C. is a member of a group of women who all rent little plots of land to grow crops for a little bit of supplemental cash. Catarina has one of the largest plots, still small at 3 cuerdas, but many of the women have only a single cuerda. She rents her plot for about US$474\/year, and grows onions and ornamental flowers like daisies and carnations. She'll invest this loan in seed, fertilizer, and pesticides. Her little business brings in only a part her income, so like the other women she has to work extensively in the fields of others to support her six children. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nCatarina, 36, has kids aged 4 to 18.. Four of them are in school and she herself finished the second grade, so she can read and write, and speaks pretty good Spanish. (Day-to-day conversations are all in her native Quich\u00e9 language.) She has her own house, with electricity and light. Her long-term dreams would be to buy a plot of her own and to build a better house. A single cuerda of land would cost more than US$1000, which will require a significant reinvestment of profit down the line.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nWomen's group: \"De la Cruz\" in La Estancia de la Cruz,

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She  is a tailor and also sells clothing material and sarongs that can be used to make various styles of one\u2019s choice. Modinot goes to Lagos Island to buy goods( clothing materials) as soon as her stock goes down. The lady in picture is her apprentice as she was at the market purchasing tailoring materials when the photograph was taken. Modinot has finished repaying her previous loan which was used to rent her shop. The balance of that loan was used to purchase a weaving machine. Modinot has been in this business for the past ten years.

In the future, Sharifah hopes to own a beauty salon. Sharifah is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by teaching her the skills of getting a job and how to read. \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders: <\/b>BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is 32 years old and single. To make a living, Joy owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community. Joy has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joy joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Joy is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Joy from PMPC. \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":583865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 40 years old, a widow and the mother of 6 children, all of whom attend school. Her husband died after a long illness. \r\n\r\nShe started a small business selling wood in 2004. She started the business with her own funds and, later in 2005, was the beneficiary of a $50 loan from the organization Hekima to strengthen her business. She sells her merchandise roadside on the principal route. She also sells gravel to construction workers. With this new loan, she will purchase supplies notably construction materials to sell to deprived work-sites. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to build a home and have the opportunity to educate her orphaned children comfortably. Additionally, her ambition is to have a motorcycle to use as part of a taxi business; she has already fully paid for the motorcycle she currently has.

He is married with five dependent children. He has worked as a trade farmer for 40 years growing vegetables. He only studied until 3rd grade, due to his humble origin. Continuing his studies was difficult for his parents so he dedicated himself to working with his father in planting because it was his father who taught him to sow. When he was 15 years old he was already sowing for himself and married when he was 22 years old. After having planted vegetables, from then on he started with tomatoes and onions in his community.

The profits will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in their work. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":281749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy smoked fish and tubers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":134539.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033704},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621072},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020037},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242782},{"amount":129.15,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":67269.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678359}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T20:10:13Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":97025,"name":"Apuu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Apuu M. is currently in the business of selling green vegetables and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

hacienda worker is hard because you need to wake up very early around 4:30 AM to perform backbreaking work for very low wages with very little benefits. What's worse, the work is seasonal - usually work is available only from October to April, and then when sugar milling season starts, from May to September, work in the hacienda is intermittent at best.\r\n\r\n<p>This was the experience of Nancy F., a 38 year-old, who is married to Berdandin F., a 46 year-old. A few years back, Berdandin stopped working in the hacienda and started selling ice buko (frozen young coconut meat and juice) around their community because it earned more income than working for a daily wage in the sugar cane fields.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing how much income her husband earned selling ice buko, Nancy joined in the efforts. She soon had many loyal customers in the local school, market and nearby villages. As demand for her product grew, Nancy's business became limited by her working capital. This made her decide to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could access the microcredit line, so that she could increase her selling capacity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans she received from NWTF-Project Dungganon helped her to increase their income capacity. In addition to her ice buko business, Nancy also saw the opportunity to earn additional income by selling rice to her neighbors in the hacienda and neighboring villages. Later, she also bought a motorcycle, on installment, for her husband to provide transportation services. The vehicle is called \"habal-habal\"; it is a single motorcycle that can carry multiple passengers at a time, although it could be hired on a per trip basis to carry only one or two passengers or a load of goods. The motorcycle will be fully-paid in a few months time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nancy is happy with how her life is going. Her only child, who is now 17 years old is attending college and has a bright future. Her family's quality of life has greatly improved from the poverty that they previously experienced; all because they worked hard and concerted all their efforts towards the goal of moving out of poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:<\/p>\r\n<p>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

But making salt is not as easy as it seems. Yes, all you need to do is leave sea water under the intense heat of the sun, wait until all the water evaporates, and then all you need to do is gather and pack the crystal residue into sacks and haul it off to the market to sell. It may sound like such a laid-back job but when you factor in what havoc even just a little rain could do to the end-product, then it wouldn't sound so easy anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is the business of Cecil C., a 52-year-old married woman who lives in the village of Tabao Baybay, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Jose, helps her with her business. They have four adult children: the oldest, who is 30 years old, already has a family; the two middle children are gainfully employed and help with the family expenses; while the youngest, who has also finished college, is still looking for a job.\r\n\r\nCecil and her husband, Jose, have been in the salt business for over fifteen years, and they have persevered in spite of the many problems they have encountered along the way. They pushed on, traveling from town to town to sell their product, even when it just earned enough to pay for the basic household expenses with some left over for the education of their four children. But when their children were nearing college age, Cecil knew that if she did not increase her income, it would certainly not be enough to send the children to get their higher education. This was her motivation in joining NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000. The additional capital provided by each loan enabled them to increase their income and afford the college education of their children. \r\n\r\nCecil now earns PHP 9,000 average monthly income for all her efforts, and is a big help to the family. The last time she borrowed from NWTF-Project Dungganon, her loan was PHP 12,000, and she used it as additional capital and it earned a good income. She paid each installment on time and fully paid the loan within its term. Now for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 that she intends to use as working capital for her salt-making business.\r\n\r\nIn the attached picture, Cecil and Jose pose in front of a few sacks of salt they are readying to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

","en":"Graciela is 48 years old. She lives in her own home with her daughter Pamela (20) and her grandson Cristopher (3). For the last two years, she has been selling socks and lingerie, but she has been a merchant for many years. Previously, she had a stall selling vegetables. She had to give this up  because she suffered from a disease that didn't allow her to exert herself very much physically and that job required picking up and arranging sacks.  This is why she decided on a job that was calmer and that she could do afternoons, since she also takes care of her grandson mornings. She works in the following way: she offers her merchandise door to door to her neighbors and friends. Later they order the clothes that they like. After a few days guaranteed, she brings the quantity and style that they have chosen and she makes a guaranteed sale. in the future she plans on having a convenience store in her house and her daughter will also help develop this project.

She is mother to two young hard-working adults who are currently enrolled in high school. By the grace of God, Nenita has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually send both of her children all the way through college.\r\n\r\nNenita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at a wholesale price and selling by piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nNenita dreams to be able to renovate her house soon, with all of the work with her business.

She earns her living by operating a butcher shop.  Her husband Romeo, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living.  They have four children who are between 27 and 36 years old. Letecia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letecia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000 uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy meat for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Letecia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With this goal in mind, this diligent family works with determination. In addition to this work, Lidia wants to enter the handicrafts trade. She is sure that knitting and selling her beautiful pieces of clothing will significantly help with her household expenses.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A.

She rises very early every day to collect the feed to give to her guinea pigs and cows.  She has been working in agriculture and livestock breeding for 17 years, from the time Delfina married and formed her family up to her present responsibility, with her husband, of educating her 3 children.  Besides feeding her cows, she also sells the milk they produce, and if a bull is produced, she fattens it and then sells it.  At times she also buys young bulls and after several months of fattening she sells them at livestock markets.\r\n\r\nDelfina works at this activity because she enjoys having fresh milk at her disposal, not only to sell, but also for her family, as well as other products, without having to go to the market to buy them.  This is why she not only has set herself the goal to maintain the lineage of her cattle, but also to improve their quality in order to increase her income.  She is requesting this loan so she can purchase some breeder guinea pigs for her farm, as well as improvements to her agricultural land with manure and fertilizers to grow potatoes and alfalfa.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":220040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of breeder guinea pigs, plus improvement of her agricultural land to grow potatoes and alfalfa","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T15:01:58Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":139.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957545},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":139.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227801},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:28Z","rounded_local_amount":139.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423034},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":139.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116262},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":139.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011218},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":133.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":139.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594821}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T14:01:58Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geoffrey and Susan Gall","image":107956}},{"id":76561,"name":"Oumar Seydi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Oumar Seydi N. est dans le secteur de la p\u00eache.

Chona started this kind of business when her brother in- law gave her money for capital in 2003. However, the capital was not enough to grow the business. In 2007, Chona found out about ASHI and she became a member of said institution. She had the opportunity to borrow and expand her business from then on until she was able to set up another source of income while waiting for the harvest: her variety store. <P>\r\n\r\nChona is so happy that she has a variety store. It has brought convenience to people in their community especially during the harvesting period. Furthermore, Chona wishes that, together with her farming business, her variety store will grow and will generate bigger profit.

Rialen has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rialen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rialen is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Rialen's first loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income and to support her children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMilo is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Milo owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for breeding. Milo has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Milo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Milo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Milo is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Milo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Additionally Hermelinda also sells seeds. Hermelinda tells us that it was not at all easy, that she had to work hard to move forward. It was thanks to her efforts and dedication that she has been able to improve her income. Her children are in university.  Over all the family enjoys a better quality of life.

R. is a farmer from a rural town named Salitre. He is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but it is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pedro is a very hard working man. Although he does not have much land, it yields enough to support him and his family. The main crop he makes is rice, although you can also find some other fruits and vegetables growing on his land. His goal is to be able to have enough production to continue financing the education of his kids. He hopes that this capital will go a long way in helping him produce more and commercialize more efficiently. <\/p>\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security.

She later decided to invest in the sale of clothing and other products and she has an influx of clients and decided to keep the business.  The loan she is requesting will be used as working capital which she needs to purchase products such as clothing for children and pants since she thinks that during this festive season she will offer a greater variety of products to her clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Manzo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":242963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital to purchase products such as children's clothing and pants.

Abdujalil is 50 years old and lives in Istaravshan town with his wife who helps him with the living expenses. Abdujalil has three children who also help him. For 15 years he has worked his land which produces onion. His greatest dream is to be able to establish more crops to that he can leave equal parts to his children. He started farming when his parents taught him to work in this way. Abdujalil is requesting financing to be able to keep them in safety for sometime and sell them later when the prices for them will increase. For that reason he is asking a loan of 3500 Somoni to buy nets and necessary items in order to keep his crop in safety and fresh.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She wishes to give them a very good education.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery day from 6 o'clock in the morning, together with her cart full of juices, she leaves in search of customers, to whom she sells her prepared delicious drinks.  She sells different kinds of drinks and fruit juices throughout the day, and in the morning, she offers her customers the popular \"hot quinoa juice\" (a drink made with a base of quinoa, cassava and apple juice), and other healthy emollients to warm people up, because it is a very cold region.  Other the other hand, what she likes the most about her job is to talk with her customers.  She has been in this business for 5 years, and considers the most difficult part for her to have to stay in the street all day, enduring the harshness of the climate.  In order to get ahead, she wishes that her business progresses and that soon she can set up a shop where she can attend to her customers more peacefully.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Elisa's eighth loan with MFP, and she feels very confident in being able to make her payments on time, since she doesn't want to cause problems with her community bank, where she is very well-loved for being a young and happy member.  With the 2,000 new soles she is requesting, she will buy new pots, glasses, and buckets, etc. in order to prepare her drinks with greater hygiene, since the ones she currently uses are already very old.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":476179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T19:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124519},{"amount":120.72,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960260},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993104},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717890},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751565},{"amount":121.44,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":346.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934033}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T21:45:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":175315,"name":"Tamaneh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are members of the Tamaneh Group.

While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Edwin has been engaged in his business for over 22 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nEdwin joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edwin is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase seeds, fertilizers and other farm inputs. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Edwin from CEVI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is true for her both in her business, family life, and Christian ministry. Norly gives her fullest to achieve success in her business, even as she actively participates in the weekly Bible fellowships and entrepreneurial activities in CCT*. Norly remains single. She resides in Pasay City with the family she has grown up with.\r\n\r\nNorly manages a \u201csari-sari\u201d store into which she pours out her focus. She has this little space adjacent to their home where she displays her products, ranging from eggs to detergents to soft drinks\u2014anything her valued customers would need. She sells a lot in her community, being able to come up with PHP18,000 net income per month. Norly has managed to run the business alone for ten years now.\r\n\r\nIn order to give more and more of her potential towards improving her store, Norly has to outsource more finances to back up her funds. She then decided to loan PHP12, 000 with the help of CCT. With these new funds, she intends to purchase more goods for her store. This will include cases of soft drinks, boxes of canned goods, and sachets of detergents and fabric conditioners. It is important for Norly that her shelves are full of products, as these will attract more customers to her store and still retain the regular ones. Because of the loan, she is able to sustain her business and make sure that she does not run out of products to sell. The loan enables her to buy the things she needs to sustain her lifestyle.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Norly faces, which is common to running sari-sari stores, is following up the debts of regular customers. Also, it is a struggle for her whenever she gets sick and weak, to run the store. But it is her goal to turn the store into a grocery. It is going to take her full effort to make it happen. \r\n\r\nNorly also desires to give her full commitment to the Christian ministry, where she belongs, and it has become of great help to her family. Included in her goals list are an owned house and a transportation vehicle for her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":778894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more goods for her sari-sari store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3800.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474148},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636929},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2714.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005239},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764412},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571546}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T02:29:10Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":306875,"name":"Felix Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e9lix, habita en la comarca el Rosario, localizada en Pueblo Nuevo municipio de Estel\u00ed, tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, de oficio agricultor, tiene tres hijos.

She is noted as being a very cheerful and sincere woman.  She lives in her own home together with her husband Rolando and her youngest son, 22 year-old Gerardo, who she loves very much.\r\n\r\nNora's business is weaving handicrafts.  She has a sales stall in the craft center in San Pedro de Cajas.  This is where she sells the items that she makes and they are bought very quickly by her customers since the designs that she makes are very original.  She also stocks her business with a variety of loom-produced crafts and tapestries from other craftspeople in her area.\r\n\r\nWhat Nora most enjoys about her work is weaving and developing her creativity.  She has been in this business for seven years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to spend the whole day on her sales stall without being able to go out.  However, this does not discourage her since she knows that she has to sell her products as quickly as she can so that she can take some time out every 20 days as her husband arrives home from the mine where he works and they are able to share most of their time together.\r\n\r\nNora also farms.  She grows potatoes once a year.  With all the goals that she is achieving, over time Nora hopes to be able to set up a larger store where she can serve her customers more comfortably.  She is a member of the \"Mujeres al Futuro\" community bank and this is her seventh loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  She is very punctual in making her loan repayments.  With your support, Nora will invest the money that she has requested in buying several skeins of ram's wool and alpaca wool so that she can continue weaving her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":808932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy ram's wool and alpaca wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-13T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1511.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712719}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T16:16:35Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":319168,"name":"Sypros","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sypros, 32 years old and married to George, has been operating her general store for the past eight years, earning a monthly income of about KES 20,000 which she uses to take care of her business and family. <p>\r\n\r\nWith a loan of KES 25,000 from KADET LTD.

In the recent 2011 season, Mildred had a very good maize yield harvesting 12 bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Mildred was only able to harvest five bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Mildred and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Mildred will educate her children and invest in business and livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Saidia SHG group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Mildred is pictured with her group members. Standing on the far left is the field officer.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":921339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danstone","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rodgers","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barasa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":364278,"name":"Lydia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia's group comprises three hard-working women.

dreams. She is 57 years old and married to George, 50, who is a fisherman.  She is a loving mother of an only child, King, who is 15 years old and a high school student. She lives in the town of Tanay, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with an opportunity of having startup capital for generating income. During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested it in planting vegetables and a hog raising business. Both businesses gave her a reasonable income, but it was lost due to a storm last September 2009.\r\n\r\nNow on her third loan, she requests 15,000 PHP for the recovery of her planting business and to also start hog fattening. Specifically, the amount will be use for both businesses. This loan will help her business, which was destroyed by huge typhoons \u201dOndoy\u201d and \u201cSanti\u201d. \r\n\r\nAs a mother, Nenita dreams of sending her son to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for a better life. She also enjoys that the loan from ASHI will change their lives and accommodate her family's needs. Through the support of ASHI, a Kiva partner, she hopes to continue reaching for her dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":486943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For
