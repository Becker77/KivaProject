The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.   Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet Republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 53-year-old Mariam J. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children between the ages of 34 and 40. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting three dependents because one is an orphan while the others' parents cannot take care of them. \r\n<p> \r\nMariam has been running a genge since 2002. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by her husband. Mariam currently earns about $20 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase sugar, rice, salt, and beans in bulk for reselling. In the future, she plans to open another business. Mariam thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. \r\n<p>\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\n One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase sugar, rice, salt and beans in bulk for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariamu K.

This will support the family's stability, allowing their children to have more optimal social conditions that contribute to their daily lives, and giving the parents the satisfaction of being able to offer their children a better standard of living. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":527083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeanina Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":677.71,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":711.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604661},{"amount":33.28,"local_amount":665.53,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":699,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640199},{"amount":34.91,"local_amount":698.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":733.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821997},{"amount":33.78,"local_amount":675.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":709.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562009},{"amount":33.45,"local_amount":668.92,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":702.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770921},{"amount":31.14,"local_amount":622.77,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":654.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204812},{"amount":33.68,"local_amount":673.55,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":707.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330508},{"amount":58.29,"local_amount":1165.82,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465666},{"amount":7.58,"local_amount":151.93,"processed_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":159.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097812}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T22:46:31Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":198458,"name":"Lovelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lovelyn is married with 7 children and they are in primary and secondary school respectively.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Adem\u00e1s le permite solventar los gastos dom\u00e9sticos, pagar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos y sobre todo puede ahorrar para cubrir alguna eventualidad que se le presente en el futuro. Julia se dedica a la agricultura desde hace 15 a\u00f1os y aunque a veces le disgusta que sus plantaciones sean atacadas por algunos insectos, es perseverante y no se deja vencer, es as\u00ed que a diario se despierta a las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para preparar los alimentos y trasladarse a su chacra, cuidar de ellas hasta que caiga la noche.

She is divorced and has six children, but only two of them live with her in the house that she owns.  Motivated by her desire to provide an adequate quality of life for her children, she decided to pursue a business.  She and her children grow bananas and coffee on their own property and on land that she has leased.  Julia considers farming to be profitable since it allows her to cover the household expenses, pay for her children\u2019s education, and set aside money for future expenses.  She has been farming for 15 years and is annoyed whenever her crops are infested with insects.  However, she is persistent and does not give up easily.  Every day she wakes up at 5am to prepare the meals that she takes with her into the fields, where she looks after her crops until nightfall.  In order to generate good income and succeed in getting the highest productivity, Julia plans to plant more coffee since it has high demand at the market.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Julia has demonstrated great enthusiasm as she continues to work with the other members of her Communal Bank.

She also does repairs and alterations. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos (php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

Jenelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jenelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to buy fish stock for her fish vending business and more merchandise for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for home repairs. Jenelyn C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Unfortunately, Abdusami's farmland is infertile, so he is in need of a loan in the amount of 13000 Somoni to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants to use on his potato crop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his partner and they have four children.  They live together in the village of Machente, an annex of San Francisco district.  They own their own home which is built from 'rustic' building materials (adobe).  The roof is made from corrugated metal.\r\n\r\nEven when he was still a teenager, Faustino worked on his parents' land.  He also worked as a laborer on other people's farms.  He saved up some money and bought his own plot of land where he has been working independently for the past five years.  He has two hectares of land planted with coffee plants and timber-producing trees such as 'pino chuncho' (a native tree), mahogany, etc.  The key to his success lies in his creativity and his desire to work.  He uses modern technology in growing his plants because he receives periodic training from agricultural engineers.\r\n\r\nFaustino's product which is in greatest demand is his coffee beans, owing to the quality of the product that he sells.  It makes him good financial income.  Normally he works alone but during harvest times he hires laborers so that he can pick and select his product more quickly.  He will use the loan he has requested to hire laborers to support him in his harvesting and weeding.  His plan for the future is to continue expanding his production so that he can continue satisfying his customers and thereby improve his living conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is Faustino's 15th loan from MFP.  He knows that the loan will help him a lot in making progress in his work.  He is grateful and requests the support of Kiva lenders in helping him to get ahead.  He is a young man who contributes ideas to his community bank which help his group to make progress.  He will use the 2,000 Peruvian soles to hire laborers to support him in his harvesting and weeding.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":823416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-26T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2052,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201852}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T21:24:49Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":325490,"name":"Seak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Seak has spent her life cultivating crops.

empez\u00f3 a buscar universidades en otro pa\u00eds donde estuviera una carrera de dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico, pues cuando peque\u00f1a siempre le gustaba el arte, en dise\u00f1o se trataba de dibujar,

que en Colombia, le comento a los familiares y aunque algunos se le burlaban del quererse ir a estudiar a otro pa\u00eds ella quiso seguir, ellos terminaron por aceptarlo pues no les quedaba de

She studied something related to Computer Engineering: Programming. After two years, she decided to stop studying anything related to computers because she realized that she is not patient enough.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Kelly Johana started to look for universities abroad that offered education in Graphic Design. As a girl, she liked art and design. She wanted to pursue her goals and found a good opportunity to study in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Everyone knows that it is cheaper to study there than in Colombia, so she told her relatives and although some of them made fun of her because she wanted to study abroad, she was persistent and her relatives just had to accept it.\r\n\r\nOne day, her mother was registering Johana\u2019s sister for the program she always wanted to study and realized that the institute offered different programs, among them Graphic Arts and Advertising. She told Johana and she decided to ask. When they told her what the program was about, she thought it was a good idea. She could postpone her studies in Argentina for a while because she knew that her sister could help her to get reduced tuition fees.\r\n\r\nWhen Johana registered, she was told that she could receive help through Kiva and that she could get some additional subsidies. She is trying hard to be able to study here and pay a reduced fee. So far, Kelly feels satisfied with her studies and hopes to receive more help with her tuition fees, so that her mother does not have to work so hard every month to be able to pay them."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1564773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay one semester's tution fee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly Johana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Santiago Mejia Dugand","image":1321107}},{"id":965,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is married; she is 48 years old and has four children.

He is married and the father of four children, one of whom attend school. He is a farmer in  GLAHOUNSA village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming.

Ever since she was a young girl, Maribel has worked in agriculture, and she now farms land that she inherited. Her principal crop is potatoes; she and her husband grow them in small quantities which are then dried in the sun. The dried potatoes form the main ingredient in a local dish. \r\nWith the sales of the potatoes they have been able to make financial progress and save enough capital to start, three months ago, raising young animals such as guinea pigs and chicks. This endeavour has provided a further economic boost for the family. Their farming activities have always been profitable because there are always customers to eat these products.\r\nMaribel sees a number of development options for the future: she wants to increase the quantity of potatoes that she grows and also to have a bigger, well-equipped farm. This is the first time she has asked for a loan with Kiva partner MFP. Because of the information she obtained about how a community bank worked, she decided to become a member and get involved. The money that she is asking for will be used to buy more knives for peeling the potatoes, and more guinea pigs and chicks.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":337100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy knives and young animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-19T22:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211899},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641426},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080865},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997006},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842345},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":89.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733924}],"funded_date":"2009-06-19T23:37:43Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":119773,"name":"Sayi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346607,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase medicine in bulk.

One of her children is in school, and the other is working.  Rosa is a very hard-working person, who has put forth great effort to get ahead as she had to single-handedly raise two children without receiving help from anyone.  She has been making cigars, which she sells to her various customers, for many years.  Customers place orders with her, and she alone makes and sells her product.  She is a very humble woman, who works hard each and every day to get ahead and support the household, whether it\u2019s to buy food or the necessary items for the home.  In this manner, she would like to get ahead, along with her children.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan in order to buy tobacco at wholesale and therefore be able to make a larger quantity of cigars.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby,

Como en esa \u00e9poca no contaba con los recursos econ\u00f3micos apropiados, gradualmente elaboraba prendas de vestir y sus clientes tra\u00edan la tela y los insumos y adornos, porque confeccionaba sobre medidas. Poco a poco con el fortalecimiento de este, lleg\u00f3 entonces a ofrecer el vestido ya elaborado, pero siempre teniendo en cuenta las medidas de cada uno. As\u00ed su negocio se convirti\u00f3 en el medio de educar a sus hijos y brindarles todo lo que requiere una familia para sostenerse. \nRuth Mar\u00eda tiene algo m\u00e1s de 13 a\u00f1os  de ser cliente asidua de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n que le ha fortalecido su capital de trabajo y de la mano de ella  ha logrado cambios positivos, con el tiempo ha crecido porque puede ofrecerle mayores opciones de ropa a sus clientes; su mayor desaf\u00edo es la innovaci\u00f3n constante para sostener a su clientela, quienes   la prefieren porque siempre presenta   estilos est\u00e1n modernos  y  adaptados a los gustos y percepciones de cada uno.

P. lives in the San Roque neighborhood in the city of Barranquilla.  She is 71 years old, and she has two children, ages 30 and 33.  What she likes to do most in life is sewing.  That is why she created a business making clothing.  \r\n\r\nFor over 25 years the business has helped her respond to the need of getting her family ahead.  After the separation from her husband, this was her biggest concern.  At that time she had no suitable economic resources.  \r\n\r\nGradually, she started making clothes.  Her customers brought her the fabric, supplies, and the trimmings because she made customized clothing.  Little by little her business became stronger, and she was able to sell ready made clothes.  However, she always keeps in mind the size of each one of her customers.  That is how her business became the means to educate her children and to support them with everything a family needs.\r\n\r\nRuth Mar\u00eda has been a regular client of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for over 13 years.  This organization has strengthened her working capital, and through it she has managed to make positive changes.  In time, the business has grown, and she is able to offer her customers a greater variety of clothing.  Her biggest challenge is the constant innovation in order to maintain her customers.  \r\n\r\nHer customers prefer her because she always has modern styles, which are adapted to what each one her customers like and their preferences.   \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan from Kiva to buy materials.  She will make elegant clothing in preparation for the end of the year season. At the end of every year she always tries to provide an abundance of elegance for these family celebrations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":609311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business. Working seven days a week and four hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW, which she used to buy seeds and fertilizer for vegetable farming. In the future, Sarswati plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal) and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

am Gul Z. and I moved to Lahore, second largest city of Pakistan, from a small mountainous town after my marriage. I live in a little rented house with my husband and five children. I understand the importance of education and therefore I have enrolled all of my children in school except the youngest two who are too small to go to school. I make decorative tassels for jewelry whereas my husband runs an electric appliances shop. Together we are able to make $200 a month.

This is 26-year-old Salome M. from Kyela. She is single but has two children ages 3 and 6. Salome has been running a vitenge (a sarong-like garment for women) and crops business since 2006. She purchases vitenge and cacao in wholesale and sells them.\r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Salome currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more vitenge and cocoa in bulk. In the future, she plans to open another business. Salome thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more vitenge and cocoa in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T07:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salome J.

She is a very loving mother of 4 children and lives happily married in her own home. After her morning household chores, she goes at 8 a.m. to her small citrus farm, where she grows oranges, mandarins and limes. She keeps her orchard painstakingly clean, and above all fumigated, so that her fruit will not be damaged by insects and can be sold at a good price. Buyers come directly to her orchard, and she sells them a hundred pieces of fruit for 3 or 4 Peruvian soles. However, in the months of January and February, fruit is in great demand in the city of Lima, so she can take advantage of this situation and sell her products at up to 10 soles per hundred. For this reason, she has recently fertilized her trees to prepare for a harvest in the [Southern] summer season, which will bring higher profits and help her cover her family's needs. In addition, while she is waiting for the harvest, she and her husband work as laborers on other farms, so that their children do not suffer from economic hardships.\r\n\r\nThis is Edubeges' first loan with MFP, and she is prepared to make all of her payments on schedule, since she does not want to cause problems for the other members who have guaranteed them.

He is well known for his excellent work, the very reason why he has many clients. \r\n\r\nJose has decided to trust in the Paraguay Foundation, requesting a loan to purchase a new tool for work, enabling him to continue creating works that capture on film and preserve as mementos the most beautiful moments in life.

the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Living in a region where raising farm animals is the main line of work, Azimjon has been selling cattle from 2004. He buys cattle from farmers who raise them, for resale at the market. Since his capital is limited, he buys only a couple of heads of cattle, and after selling them, he returns to buy more. Azimjon would like to expand his business by increasing his working capital and maximizing his profit. This is why he is requesting  a loan to buy  young cattle. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

She understands that new selections will help her satisfy the needs of her customers. Her goal is to see each customer leave with what they like and need. Ludmila is excited about the opportunity to see her business grow and change. She is also very delighted to earn additional funds so that she will be able to provide for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":216242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase working capital for winter season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Zaporozhye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T17:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludmila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T20:33:49Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9942577},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14866209},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20408508},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27101476},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35995658},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":503.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44578500}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T19:33:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:55:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Guilfoyle","image":391554}},{"id":74749,"name":"40- Qu\u00e3ng H\u01b0ng Group","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":" \nCh\u1ecb N.

This is 32-year-old Merida N. from Kyela. She is married with three children between the ages of one and eight years old. She has been running a crops-selling business since 2006.

Merida thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice and cocoa in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merida B.

Houda has been doing tattoos since 2002, and has been doing eyebrows for a year. Houda requested a loan of $1000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase tools for her tattoos. This is her fourth loan cycle and she has always paid on time. \r\n\r\nHer previous loans helped her purchase what she needed for her work, and with them she was able to meet her family\u2019s needs.

Therefore, Alis concluded that she needed to work and help with the household finances.  For three years she has been selling various crops grown by local farmers.  She later decided to sell to a distributor who comes to her house to pick up the produce.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Alis raises and sells sheep.  Her customers are livestock dealers who pass through the area.  She wants to buy some sheep to raise for later resale.  For this reason, she has requested her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlis is committed, hardworking, and optimistic.

The circumstances force these people to go to work as soon as they graduate from high school. The life makes these people grow up earlier and start supporting their families, whereas their peers may still enjoy their youth. However, there is an advantage to this state of affairs. Beginning to support one\u2019s family from early age makes this person mature and better prepared for life. From this point they could regard themselves even as fortunate ones. T. K. Albina, the leader of this group, is one of these fortunate youngsters, who started earning their livelihood at an early age. Albina is nineteen years old. She is single and lives with her family. She has a sister, who is two years younger than her. Albina combines two jobs. During her spare time she helps her mother, who is occupied with manufacturing traditional articles of bedding and coverlets. Her mother used to work in a sewing workshop, but because of the low salary, she decided to start her own business. Albina has applied for this loan to help her mother purchase fabric and expand their business.\r\n\r\nAlbina\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nAinur, 45, is single. She lives with her father. Because of her father\u2019s illness Ainur is temporarily not working, as she has to stay by her father\u2019s side and take care of him. Her brother provides them with food and medicine. Ainur needs this loan to buy a washing machine, a DVD player and a ton of coal. \r\n\r\nSvetlana, 47, is a mother of four children. Her husband works as a bus driver. Svetlana is a teacher in an elementary school. One of Svetlana\u2019s daughters goes to college and Svetlana needs a loan to pay for tuition. \r\n\r\nAlisa, 55, lives in a city of Balykchi. Alisa trades in sea\u2013buckthorn. Her husband, 65, is retired. Her youngest son, 21, works as a waiter in a caf\u00e9. At weekends he helps Alisa sell the sea\u2013buckthorn. Alisa has applied for this loan to purchase ten sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It is situated about 30 km (one hour's drive) from Kupang City. Even though this village is categorized as a remote place, the road into the village is good and has been sealed. There are 35 families who live in the village. The community in Oenif Village relies on farming as their primary income source. The most difficult challenge faced by the community is lack of water for watering their crops. They usually sell their agricultural crops in Inpres Market at Kupang City, as there is no traditional market available in the village. They take motorbike taxis to bring their agricultural crops to Inpres Market as there is no public transport from their village. It costs IDR. 20.000\/ return trip.\r\n\r\nNazaret A Group is led by a 41 year old, Obednego L.. He is married and blessed with three nice children. They are: \r\n- Remli L., 17 years old, who is in the Second Grade of Senior High School\r\n- Reliana L., 14 years old, who is in the Second Grade of Junior High School\r\n- Rismi L., 7 years old, who is in the First Grade of Elementary School\r\n\r\nObednego relies on agricultural crops and the breeding of pigs and goats. Obednego is very concerned about his children\u2019s education. For Obednego education is a priority for his children\u2019s future. Currently, Remli is studying in a Catholic School in So\u2019e - South Central Region of Timor in East Nusa Tenggara Province. It is situated about 150 km from Oenif Village, so they need a lot of money to pay his education costs. He has to send IDR 500,000 per month to pay for his son\u2019s school, living expenses and daily needs. This is one of the reasons why Obednego has to work hard at selling his crops. Fortunately, his wife is able to help him with selling their agricultural crops at the market.\r\n\r\nAs the father of 3 children, Obednego dreams of providing a better life for his family and to support his children\u2019s education through to University. The lack of capital is the main issue for him in improving his family\u2019s living standard. Moreover, he also does not have any other skills to generate further income. One day he heard from the clergyman in the village that the Kiva field partner \u2013 TLM Foundation, assists poor farmers, particularly in West Timor, by providing loans through the Cattle Fattening Program. He is very interested in joining the program as he has experience in fattening livestock and he thinks this program will have a positive impact on his family\u2019s future.   \r\n\r\nObednego discussed it with his neighbours and they are also interested in the program so they formed a group which is called Nazaret A. Obednego is requesting a loan of IDR 3,200,000 to buy a young cow to be fattened over a 12 month period. Other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle as they are sure this program is a good way for them to improve their families\u2019 lives. \r\n\r\nNote: Sarlota and Sara were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":517128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Oenif","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Obednego","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melanus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yublina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2825,"local_amount":25600000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25622750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201364948}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T04:11:09Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":194408,"name":"Felix Nilton","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"FELIX TIENE 27 A\u00d1OS, ES SOLTERO Y TRABAJA EN CONSTRUCCION, ES UNA PERSONA RESPONSABLE \nQUE SE INICIO EN ESTE NEGOCIO HACE MAS DE 2 A\u00d1OS APROXIMADAMENTE.

Her business has grown quickly over the years and she has gained much experience as a businesswoman. Her earnings have enabled her to build a winter house and buy a truck, so that her husband and youngest son could operate their transportation business. Thanks to their business and endless effort, three of her four children have attended University and gotten their degrees. Now they are all married and able to take care of their families by themselves.

The members of this family are all hardworking, honest and effective people who could use the bank loans successfully and improved their quality of life and pay the loan back on time. Handsuren is requesting a 2,000,000 MNT to purchase more meat that she could sell and make more money during Tsagaan Sar, Mongolian Traditional New Year.

She participates in about 3 activities a day. She feels she has a lot more free time and wishes to occupy this time with business.

For this reason, she wants to start selling charcoal for more income. \r\n<p>\r\nShe requests a loan of 250,000 Ugandan shillings, which she will repay in 7 months. This equals a loan request of USD150.

Fish are plentiful in the waters around the city and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet.  She is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of $240. She works at the business for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Eloina has a dressmaking workshop located in her house, because of which she now doesn't have room to work, so she is constructing a room for her workshop. She has many years of experience in dressmaking and secure clients. The loan will be invested in the construction of her workshop.

Here is a story about one woman, which is an example of bravery and self-confidence. \r\n<br>After her marriage, Tynymkan M. never dreamed she would suffer. As the eldest child in her family, she was responsible \u2013 and that is why she did not think much about marriage. However, kidnapping is common in the country; Tynymkan was kidnapped, but she still thought about her family and her brothers and sisters. Unless her siblings married, she took care of them. She also decided to take care of herself because she was getting older. \r\n<br>Finally, Tynymkan gave birth, little knowing that her happiness would not last much longer. Her husband died the same year from a heart attack. At that moment, it seemed her life was totally destroyed. However, her child motivated her to move on. Her son became an adult and graduated from university. But life is very cruel, and on the way home, he fought with a group of scum who mutilated him forever. He is now 40 years old and an invalid.\r\n<br>The situation was unimaginable. However, Tynymkan took a loan of 15,000 KGS and bought three sheep for fattening and reselling. Now her life is not so bad, and she is requesting another loan to increase her number of cattle in order to sell them and help her child.\r\n<p>\r\nAynagul B. is 39 and married. She has five children, and her husband works as a welder for a company. Her elder daughter works in a caf\u00e9 as a waitress while the rest are still at home. Five years ago, they bought some cattle with her husband's salary and began their business. They are planning to increase their number of cattle so that they can educate their children. They want to take a loan in order to buy fodder.\r\n<p>\r\nAynur J. is 39, a widow, and has two children who both attend the local school. She is planning to apply for a job and marry successfully. She is requesting a loan for dental treatment.\r\n<p>\r\nAygul J. is 38, married, and has five children. Her husband works as a driver in a company.

She lives with her husband and two sons, ages 8 and 5, and baby daughter, age 1.  Carmen sells plastic products, such as food or water storage containers.  She also sells small chairs and different types of cosmetics.  She sells all of these products on foot, making a daily income, most of which she must spend on her family and on household expenses.  This makes it difficult for her to invest in her business and making it difficult for her to grow it.  For this reason, Carmen is requesting a loan through Integral, so that she can have the necessary funds to buy cosmetics in bulk, so that she can offer various types at various prices, allowing her to attract more customers.  Carmen works hard every day for the well-being of her family.  She would like to give only the best to her three children and ensure that they are never in need of their basic requirements.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":499457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala, departamento de Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2010-03-02T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128899225},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136627398},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144661464},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151845904},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159584505},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166794935},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172064337},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177355287},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182489952},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188624740},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191367702},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196807245}],"funded_date":"2010-03-08T18:33:33Z","paid_date":"2011-03-23T08:16:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

This is Swaibu. He is the Director of Jinja Progressive Secondary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Jinja with 2500 students. Jinja Progressive Secondary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school requires two systems due to the high population; one will be installed in the dining hall and another in the boy\u2019s dormitory. This loan will be used to install the first system in the dormitory section. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with two 750 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nJinja Progressive Secondary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Swaibu ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1727532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Since it is a tradition, there is always a huge demand for hamacas (swings).\r\n\r\nFrom an early age Alicio started working with his mother in the production of swings and bedspreads. They started selling their products to different craft stores, but then they realized that they could sell on their own, and that would be much more profitable.

Sabina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Lending. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a lending microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microlending is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Sabina would like to purchase rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil, kerosene, etc., to resell at her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-23T18:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-06T22:02:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970719},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886936},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436196},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130469},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027271},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613296},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010379},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232690},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664506},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50219.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105251}],"funded_date":"2008-10-23T21:02:47Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jen Villareal","image":832064}},{"id":74781,"name":"Mutabar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G.

Moreover, they sometimes sell bedsheets and embroidered clothing made of poplin. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to satisfy the needs of their clientele, they decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom they are on their 5th solidarity loan, after having reimbursed the other four loans successfully. This loan will be used to buy 5 sacks of millet (part of which will be made into fried cakes to sell), 3 sacks of dried okra, and 8 sacks of fresh onions (which will be peeled, washed, cut into small pieces, dried in a dryer, then packaged up in plastic.)<P>\r\n\r\nA good part of this processed onion will be kept until the off-season, where onions are rare in the markets.
