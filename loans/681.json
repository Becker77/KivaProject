This loan of $100 will be his first from GHAPE, one of Kiva's field partners, and will be used to purchase kerosene, oil, Maggi (a popular seasoning in Cameroon), plantain stems for planting and labor to assist in clearing his farmland.  \r\n\r\nBecause there is a constant demand for the household products Paul sells, as well as the convenient location of his store, he believes his business will succeed.  In addition, Paul is helping the community by purchasing the plantain stems from fellow neighbors.  \r\n\r\nAll three of his children are under the age of fifteen, so the profits of his business will go toward his children's school fees and to expand his farming business.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Juliana Haine  has 1 year of experience in this business.  Juliana Haine  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  Juliana is joining the program to request a fund for developing her business for the sake of her family financially.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Juliana Haine  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Juliana Haine 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Juliana Haine  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Albertine lives with her husband and children in the Abokicodji neighborhood of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She has lived in this neighborhood for about twelve years.  The couple shares the different family responsibilities.  \r\n\r\nAlbertine did not go to school.  For the last twelve years, she has been preparing and selling \u201cakassa\u201d (a local food made of cornstarch) at her home.  Albertine buys corn in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(age 52) has been widowed since 1997.  She lives in a small village across the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers north of Phnom Penh.  She shares her one-room house wI. three of her children, one son-in-law and one grandson.   Though Thorn learned to weave from her mother many years ago, she\u2019s been working at it commercially for only about seven or eight years.  She has also taught her daughter, now age twenty-one, (see photo) who joined on a second loom.  They both laughed that the daughter is now the better weaver because her eyes are better than her mother\u2019s.  <P>\r\n\r\nThorn is requesting this, her third loan from MAXIMA, in the amount of $300. She will use the funds from the loan to buy materials for weaving.  Prior to taking out a loan, Thorn worked on a barter basis wI. a local middleperson.  The middleperson would advance her an amount of weaving thread.  Out of that thread, Thorn would give back two finished pieces and get the profit only from one.

Thus far, she has obtained two loans of $40 and $300 respectively and the repayment was satisfactory.  The loans accomplished many things, such as paying school fees for her children and grandchildren, supporting the health of her family and feeding the family.\r\n\r\nGiven this loan, Grace plans to construct a new pig pen, electrify the pig pen to give light to the pigs when they are about to deliver at night. She also plans to buy 10 piglets to add to the ones she already has, to prepare a packing space for her firewood, and to continue buying and splitting of wood. She promises to start repayment at the fourth month from the date of disbursement.  \r\n\r\nWith the profit from the loan, she plans to expand her business, continue to pay school fees for her children and grandchildren, and take care of the health and feeding in the family.\r\n\r\nGrace prefers a loan from GHAPE because the means  of repayment is easier, the loan scheme is encouraging, the interest paid on GHAPE loans is relatively low as compared to other financial institution, and lastly, GHAPE does proper follow up with their clients to ensure the loan is manage judiciously."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":177366,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for new pig pen, and piglets and firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntahsen Market Square, NW.

After the recovery, Leontine decided to change the business because of a broken finger that she got from the accident.  She opened a general boutique in late 2005 and has been operating this business to the present day. She sells soaps, sugar, salt, milk, toilet papers, oil, cans, and other household goods. Her business strategies are based on the high quality of goods, strategic pricing, caring for clients and never running out of inventory.

Mr. Sambath B. is the 40 year old village bank president. He is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice to earn a living. In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile and this is badly affecting his crop. In order to solve this problem, he decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and he will use the rest of the loan to purchase fuel to pump water to support the field and make his crop more productive. His wife, Mrs. Keo Phanith, is a housewife who is a good cooker and a good mother. Mr. Sambath B. has seven children, one of whom is a construction worker, while another two are waiters in the restaurant, three others are enrolled in the local school, and the youngest one is too young to work or study.    \r\n\r\nFive members in this group loan are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Those with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

They are blessed with nine children of whom four are still studying and the rest are now working. Her husband is doing manual labor jobs and at the same time is engaged in farming. With this situation, it has been so hard for her to raise their big family. She decided to engage in fish selling and was able to sustain this business for three years, even in times of hardships. She joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) a year ago because she is very much interested in PMPC's various products and services. Having successfully repaid two previous loans, she was able to borrow an amount of 7,000 Philippine pesos for her third loan to obtain needed capital for her business. Her dream in life is to be able to send all her children to college so that they will have a better future and be able to improve their living

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,450,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 6,322,000 VND which will again be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell.

By working hard in her general store, electronic reloading and rice retailing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,000.\r\n\r\nDelia S. is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to sustain the growth of her general store, electronic reloading and rice retailing businesses. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Delia S. hopes to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

As a single mother, she is characterized by being a responsible and very dedicated person who takes good care of her 2 children, Roc\u00edo and Anderson, whom she loves very much. As a hard-working and persistent woman, every morning she works in her fields growing peas, spinach and carrots, which she cares for with great dedication and effort. Over the course of time she was able to acquire her own agricultural lands. With the current demand for vegetables in the city's market, she also needed to rent other lands to plant in greater quantities. Parallel to this activity, she works buying and selling vegetables in the country's capital, where she has been traveling for the past 12 years. Her work consists of buying various kinds of vegetables and produce, which she combines with her own harvest. She sells them at the market in the capital called \"La Parada,\" where, as she mentions in her own words, she \"is finished selling in 2 hours.\" Now she has planted spinach, which she will harvest within a week. Her business is going very well for her, and her aspirations are great: she would like to open a store selling compost and fertilizers in her town, where most of the inhabitants are farmers. She belongs to the \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d communal bank. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for this support, since it helps her keep advancing toward her goals.

These women work together and live together in Phnom Penh, and their bond of friendship runs deep,  as they have overcome incredibe adversity together. \n\nAll of these women come from difficult family backgrounds, namely large single parent families. One of the women was orphaned at an early age and another suffered from abuse. With the assistance of a counter-human trafficking NGO, the women left their families in the rural provinces and moved to Phnom Penh to attend vocational training school. This NGO provides alternative livelihood options for children deemed to be at high risk of trafficking due to vulnerable family situations. Once sewing school was complete, the five women of Circle Cambodia found employment with a woman who ran a small tailor shop out of her home. This woman did provide housing, but unfortunately she made some poor financial decisions and became heavily indebted, and within a short time she started withholding salaries from her employees, using the money to pay down her own debt instead. Without having another place to live, the women of Circle Cambodia were trapped in an exploitative working and living situation. One year later a tailor shop customer found out about the injustice of the working conditions, and she facilitated a way out for the women, provided them with a new place to live and a promise of future business once the women were able to buy their own sewing machines.  \n\nPhany, one of the youngest women in the group, has the most sewing experience. She has been sewing since 2003 and is an accomplished seamstress. She excels at cutting patterns - a skill she is teaching the other group members who started sewing in 2007.  Phany's cheerful personality, friendly demeanor and quite confidence seems to be a unifying force in the group. Phany grew up in Kompong Cham province of Cambodia. Her father died when she was young, which resulted in great financial hardship for the family as Phany's mother tried to support her 10 children. Prior to coming to Phnom Penh, Phany was working in the fields, picking beans, for a wage of $0.75 a day. Phany enjoys sewing, and her outlook on the future of Circle Cambodia is bright. \n\nEach member of the Circle Cambodia co-operative requested a loan of $145 to be used for the purchase of a sewing machine. The disbursal meeting was filled with excitement, and the women already had plans for an afternoon trip to the market to shop for machines. Circle Cambodia has secured initial orders and they look forward to expanding their business to include Cambodian customers and possibly even foreign customers through an online global marketplace. The women take English lessons for one hour each day, and the women are teaching an illiterate member of the group how to read in the Khmer language. The Circle Cambodia co-operative  dreams that one day their business will be successful enough for them to start training new employees who come from similar vulnerable backgrounds. \n\nAbout SIGU:\nThis loan is the first made by AMK's Special Interest Group Unit (SIGU). As part of the Product Development department, SIGU was developed as an initiative to further reflect AMK\u2019s mission, and to serve more \u2018vulnerable\u2019 groups that are currently underserved by microfinance services. These groups include women who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence and other gender-based traumas, people living with HIV\/AIDS, street people and children and people with disabilities. AMK is currently focusing on assisting women who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence and other gender-based traumas. Current SIGU projects include developing microfinance specific financial literacy training and creating a pilot credit program specific to this population. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":428221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"buy sewing machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-20T06:47:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ngith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phally","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thavy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":725,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626741},{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123862157},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T07:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137012101},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151839402},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159579916},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166790196},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172059579},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177350707},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188620345}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T10:18:01Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Darren Miao","image":159592}},{"id":157720,"name":"Ma.

Thanks to the support of her husband, Martha was able to move forward with her harvest.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is now in need of additional capital in order to maintain her pineapple crop.  With this assistance, she will be able to harvest a quality product that commands a high selling price.  This will guarantee that her family can recoup the money they have invested and use it for new projects.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":474058,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials & supplies needed to maintain her pineapple crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-21T06:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":783.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841606},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":783.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874535},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":783.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604404},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":783.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639874},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":783.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821654},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":783.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561662},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":783.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770592},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":783.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204482}],"funded_date":"2010-01-21T08:19:55Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":174296,"name":"Alibala","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alibala N. is a 56-year-old man who runs his own barber shop in Agsu city.

Jocelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jocelyn from GDMPC.

She is 33 years old. Arilyn is married and has 6 children; 4 are still studying and 2 are already married. To make a living, Arilyn owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community. Arilyn has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Arilyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.

On his lands, he has rice, cattle and some other fruits such as mangoes. He will use the loan to invest in rice production and to buy a few new steers. He hopes he can continue to improve his lands and increase his property. He has three children. One is still in school. The other two help him out with his cattle ranching and farming. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alex is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserves for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. The loans will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy new steers and invest in rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-13T07:03:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adler","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-28T02:12:54Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:24:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31435},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:29:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40409},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:41:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53265},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:28:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73633},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:37:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88537},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:46:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99033}],"funded_date":"2007-05-14T02:12:54Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:46:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14145,"name":"Fatma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatma is married with three children and lives in the Kigamboni area of Dar es Salaam, where she runs a food-vending business along the shores of Indian Ocean.

Melihat hal ini, I Made Wenten menganggap sebagi peluang bisnis yang bisa diandalkan. Selain tetap mengerjakan sawahnya sendiri, I Made Wenten melayani penjualan beraneka jenis pupuk yang diperlukan oleh petani. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, I Made Wenten membeli pupuk di pedagang besar dan memasarkannya kembali. Para petani merasa sangat terbantu dengan usaha I Made Wenten, karena mereka dapat dengan mudah memperoleh pupuk.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":369332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To pay rent for several months","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T09:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105866},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022977},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868218},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757414},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146508},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":88266.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984653}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T05:03:13Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":132987,"name":"Fabiola Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fabiola del Rosario Hern\u00e1ndez B\u00e1rcenas tiene 25 a\u00f1os.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She doesn\u2019t pay rent for her business premises because she works from her home.\r\n\r\nOliver sells to all categories of people, both in retail and wholesale. She buys her foodstuffs from Owino Market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda, and so she incurs transport costs to and from shopping. Her challenges include transportation and the rainy season as she works in an open space.\r\n\r\nOliver wants to use this loan to buy more bags of sweet potatoes, cassava and bunches of bananas.

Along with his wife he has endeavored to give better opportunities to their two children.  His wife emigrated to the United States of America to be able to work and improve their dwelling, since the work here in Nicaragua is scarce.  Se\u00f1or Juan has various businesses; he teaches English, has a taxi and a small bookstore in his home.  He gives classes part time in the morning, then in the afternoon provides his taxi service.  In his house he has a person that administers the bookstore.  He does all this with the objective of obtaining profits to be able to make improvements to his house, such as to pay for water, lights, and telephone. He has achieved all this with his efforts and the remittances that his wife has sent.  With the loan that he is requesting he will buy building materials such as: stone, sand, iron and cement and other things to be able to make the porch across his house and to have more space, since he has the bookstore in the living room and it is small and makes things difficult.  He wants to invest more and relocate the bookstore on the porch.  For more security from outsiders, since it would be on the porch it needs better security.  In the future he would like to be able to increase sales, to buy other showcases and to be able to offer more products.  All this he expects to achieve with his work and the support of the institution.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":474085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to add a porch to his house where he can relocate his bookstore.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Laulaau  has 3 years of experience in this business.  Laulaau  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Laulaau  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Laulaau 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Laulaau  Lea L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a member of the Bora business group, aged 55 years, widowed, and the mother of four children, three of whom are students.  The fourth is not able to study due to lack of money.  Eliza K. sells pagnes (lengths of colored cloth used for clothing) for women.  She sets up at the central market in Virunga. She was able to start her business with money received from her oldest daughter.  She has been in business for ten years. This new loan will allow her to stock up on new merchandise (four bundles of pagnes).  In addition, she aspires to grow her business and spend the rest of her life in peace according to the will of God.

Barranquilla con su esposa y tiene 2 hijos en las edades de 27 y 33 a\u00f1os. All\u00ed en su barrio tiene un negocio mediante el cual elabora productos alimenticios, como chuzos de carne, pollo, chorizo o butifarra acompa\u00f1ado de verduras, que venden \u00e9l y su esposa por volumen a negocios que comercializan comidas r\u00e1pidas y tambi\u00e9n directamente ellos, a trav\u00e9s de 2   carritos especiales que \u00e9l mismo dise\u00f1\u00f3, de 1,10 metros por 60 cent\u00edmetros,  compuestos por 3 llantas, un espacio delantero donde ubica su asador y parrillas, una vitrina y un deposito ubicado en la parte trasera, donde guardan los insumos. La idea de emprendimiento surgi\u00f3 desde el a\u00f1o 1978 en la ciudad de Barranquilla,  porque Ricardo antes de iniciarlo en esta ciudad,  se dedicaba a viajar de feria en feria por todo el pa\u00eds, y cuando lleg\u00f3 a vender sus productos durante la \u00e9poca del Carnaval, pens\u00f3 como dice la canci\u00f3n del fallecido maestro Joe Arroyo \u201cEn Barranquilla me quedo\u201d y desde entonces se estableci\u00f3 en esta capital, previendo su potencial comercial.

","en":"Ricardo is 49 years old and he lives in the community of San Roque in the city of Barranquilla. He lives with his wife and he has 2 children, aged 27 and 33. He has a business in his community through which he produces foods, such as meat skewers, chicken, spicy sausages or traditional Peruvian sausages with sides of vegetables. He and his wife sells these products in quantities to businesses that sell fast foods but they also sell directly to the clients. They have 2 special carts which he designed, measuring 1.1 meters by 60 centimeters and bearing three tires. The front section consists of a roaster and grills, a display, and a storage container in the back where they keep their ingredients. The business idea started out in 1978 in the city of Barranquilla. Prior to this business Ricardo used to travel from fair to fair throughout the entire country. But when he came to sell his products during the Carnaval season, he was inspired by the song of the late Joe Arroyo, named \"En Barranquilla me quedo\", meaning \"I will stay in Barranquilla\". Since then he has established himself in the capital, having seen the potential for commerce. His greatest challenge is his working capital and often it is insufficient to meet the vendors' demand. And this is the reason why he requests a Kiva loan. He will purchase ingredients with which he will prepare his products and he will also purchase tools such as spits, forks, and tongs. He will also purchase plastic containers where to store the condiments. His greatest dream is to have a house of his own and to set up a fast food supply company."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":825247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients to prepare his products and to purchase tools such as spits, forks, and tongs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-03T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":86059},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91541},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":93296},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":95084},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":96907},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":98764},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100657},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102586},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":104552},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":106556},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":108599},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":115399}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":86059,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88233.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803680},{"amount":53.4,"local_amount":91541,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":93853.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614760},{"amount":54.42,"local_amount":93296,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T08:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":95653.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568714},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":95084,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":97486.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780047},{"amount":114.14,"local_amount":195671,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":200614.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188441},{"amount":58.72,"local_amount":100657,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103200.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038717},{"amount":59.84,"local_amount":102586,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":105178.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650876},{"amount":60.99,"local_amount":104552,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":107193.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100422},{"amount":125.5,"local_amount":215155,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":220591.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338057},{"amount":67.32,"local_amount":115399,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":118314.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394675}],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T00:28:28Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":326398,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa sells beans and rice at Abura.

He owns one unit of tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar attached into it) that carries up to four or five passengers to their destination within the community. He earns through the boundary (daily quota) that their driver remits each day. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of PHP 300 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan for additional spare parts and the maintenance of his tricycle unit. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business.  \r\n\r\nManuel hopes to be able to expand soon and to sustain their daily needs. He faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members to share stories of his work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":369358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her oldest son, Purevdaavuu studies at a religious institution in India and her three younger daughters all attend a local secondary school. During the day, Erdentungalag operates a carpentry business with the help of her husband. She started her business in 2005 with working capital of 100,000 tugrugs, and has successfully expanded her business over the years. Today her working capital exceeds 1,000,000 tugrugs. In addition to her carpentry business, Erdenetungalag also operated a sausage manufacturing business between 2008 and early 2010. However, with the growing success of their carpentry business she and her husband have decided to focus on one business. Erdenbileg has used her earnings to support her family's expenses and children's tuition fees. She says that being reliable has helped her most to expand her business.

This same group is obtaining their third credit with Mol Bulak Finance.  They worked off all of the previous loans very well.  Every one of the women achieve their goal by obtaining a loan with MBF, however, they all have one goal to strive for, which is to improve their welfare and provide the best for their children.  Let\u2019s begin the presentation of the group with its leader. \r\n\r\nZebi is 61 years old.  Her husband works as a veterinarian in the village.  Not only does the health of livestock depend on him, but also the welfare of the village population.  Losses of livestock mean losses of incomes of the families who live here.  Zebi is also involved in animal husbandry.  She plans to use this loan to buy a sheep and one calf.\r\n\r\nGulnara is 55 years old, married.  Her husband works as a security guard at a local school.  She has 8 children: 6 daughters and 2 sons.  The majority of participants are involved in breeding and fattening of domestic livestock.  Gulnara is also not an exception.  She has been involved in this business since 1976.  Now she wants to buy a cow with a calf in order to obtain and sell dairy products.\r\n\r\nErkin is 56 years old.  She was previously involved in farming and grew tobacco.  Now she is involved in animal husbandry.  Her children and husband help her with the business.  The goal of the loan is to buy cattle.\r\n\r\nSavirahon is a widow with 4 children.  She has 3 sons and a daughter.  She plans to purchase a sheep.\r\n\r\nKadicha is 55 years old, a widow.  She has two children, both of whom attend a village school.  She is requesting her third loan for the purchase of a sheep for subsequent fattening.\r\n\r\nBurmayim and Sayragul are 54 and 53 years old respectively.  They also want to buy small livestock that will be sent off to a pasture.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

In addition to making loan interest payments, they will use a portion of their revenues to address common family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":309182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy cosmetics, fruit, and vegetables ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8bou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baro Sanogo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata Fab\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Cissoko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":399999.99,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":403606.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020221},{"amount":266.68,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134535.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242974},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":134535.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678738},{"amount":266.65,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":134535.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112589}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T04:20:43Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":108409,"name":"Azalia Graciela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.Z. tiene una pulper\u00eda desde hace un a\u00f1o operando bajo el nombre de Pulper\u00eda y Variedades  \"AZALIA\" su negocio esta ubicado en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n. ella es casada y madre de 4 hijos, todos dependen al 100% de ellos, tres de sus hijos estudian en la secundaria y primaria de los centros educativos publicos de la ciudad.
