The eldest daughter is 21 years old and a college graduate while the youngest is six years old and an elementary school pupil.\r\n\r\nAs a mother, Juanita\u2019s dreams are always for her children and family. She wants to bring her children into a decent life. In 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to have access to capital for the continuation of her dying business. Her previous loans were carefully utilized as additional and rolling capital for her fish cage. A fish cage is used as a venue for fingerlings to be cultured until ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nNow on her 3rd loan, Juanita proposes a loan of 15,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish-cage business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for three rolls of assorted fish nets, a hundred pieces on bamboo, wires and other tying materials and also for labor expenses.\r\n\r\nJuanita is hopeful that her business will grow and that someday she will have more fish cages. She also dreams of sending all her children to school until college and that they find jobs. One of her aspirations is to be able to build a house that is durable and spacious.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":387967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Ilhomjon is 24 years old. He is married and has a little child. Ilhomjon has a small place in the market where he sells all kinds of small items necessary for a household. He has been in this kind of business for four years. Ilhomjon wants his children to have a higher education, and that is why he is working hard together with his wife, who always assists him in everything. The business is successful, bringing considerable income to the family. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Ilhomjon wants to expand his business and to increase his working capital for purchasing new goods to sell. With this purpose he is requesting 4000 TJS. Having received a loan from IMON twice already, and having demonstrated himself as a reliable client, Ilhomjon promises to manage this loan with accuracy.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The couple cares for eight children, six of whom are their own.  All of the children attend school and live together with their parents in the Zogbo quarter in Cotonou, the economic capital of B\u00e9nin.  The couple shares the family responsibilities.  Marguerite did not attend school.  For about 10 years Marguerite has been in the business of selling fabric, as a traveling vendor and at the Vedoko market in Cotonou.  This work brings income which she uses to develop her business further and to meet her daily needs.  Marguerite secures her supplies in Dantokpa, the international market in B\u00e9nin.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. Monuments, is a uniquely community-oriented company. Virgilio prides himself in serving seniors in his Hispanic community by offering them reasonably priced, high quality products. His aim, he says, is to help these seniors provide respectable, well-crafted monuments for their loved ones that fit into their small and often fixed-income budgets.\r\n\r\nVirgilio\u2019s business, which he began 15 years ago, makes stone memorial monuments for cemeteries. The ideas to start his business came to him while working at a funeral home, during which time he started to create monuments for the customers there. When people began to comment on how much they liked his work and asked for more of his products, Virgilio opened the doors to D. A. Monuments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he sells his products directly to members of the Hispanic community and has contracts with various cemeteries in his area. The business has grown enough in the past 15 years to support two full-time employees and two others who are on-call. However, even with these employees, the amount of sketching, measuring, and designing necessary to fill his monument orders was causing Virgilio to work ten to twelve hour days, including weekends. As a result, he decided to modernize his business, utilizing cutting-edge computer design equipment to save time and allow his business to take on more orders.\r\n\r\nVirgilio used his loan to purchase a computer system called Monu-Cad, worth $15,000, which allows him to map out the design of his products on the computer. It dramatically cuts down on the amount of work he has to do; he says what used to take 24 hours can now be done in an hour and a half. His is the only business that offers that type of quick service in his town, and he is now able to produce and sell significantly more products.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Virgilio hopes to continue offering the affordable, reliable products for his community members along with gaining more large contracts with cemeteries. Since his loan freed up a lot of time that would otherwise be spent hand-designing his products, he believes that he can now truly begin growing into larger markets. \r\n\r\nHis 15 years in business has led Virgilio to offer the following advice on frugality and fiscal responsibility to aspiring business-owners: \u201cYou can\u2019t live a luxurious life because your business will claim it; you have to be cautious with your expenditures.\u201d With this knowledge and his newly modernized workplace, Virgilio hopes to continue serving the monument needs of his customers and his community.

They all live together in their own house in the district of Pichari.  By the time she was 12, Marina already knew about farming, preparing the land for planting, agronomy, the harvest, and even sales.  That's how she and her parents grew cacao, coffee, bananas, sesame, and peanuts.  Mostly it was coffee and cacao, because both products are in high demand on the domestic market as well as internationally.  Marina still grows coffee, and this year the price hit 10 soles per kilo; at that price you can recoup your investment, so Marina wants to further expand her farm by planting more coffee.  She can always count on help from her beloved husband, who helps her out with whatever job needs to be done most.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Marina's first loan with MFP, so she is committed to making her payments on time.

Her clientele seems to grow daily, which makes her feel satisfied. <p>\r\nWith the $700 loan, which she plans to repay in six months, she will purchase the ingredients she needs to make her meals such as rice, sugar, beans and legumes, all kinds of vegetables, beef, chicken and pork, which will help her tend to customers. She will also buy some big pots for her business. A part of the money will be used to finish the roof on her home, as well. <p>\r\nLoisith is an enthusiastic 35-year-old with six children whom she wants to give a better future.

Currently her family's main source of income is trading and selling general goods and raising livestock with an income of 3,000,000 VND\/month.  Besides that main business, her husband also works as a construction worker so the family has a supplemental income of 3,000,000 VND\/month.  With this stable income, the family's quality of life is improving day by day.  Mrs. N. would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND in this round of funding to invest in buying more goods to serve the demands of her customers in the upcoming Tet New Year's holiday.  \r\n<br

K. is 45 years old, married, and a father of four children who are currently in school. He sells fuel in gallons in the community where he lives. The distance from the village to the big town is quite great, so what he does is buys the fuel in gallons and resells it to the commercial vehicle drivers who plight that road to pick up passengers. Yaw has been in this business for the past three years. He says what he does is risky because he does not have a bigger container to store the fuel; instead he uses smaller gallons which can catch fire. He requests the loan to buy bigger fuel containers so that he can store larger quantities of fuel for his customers. It seems Yaw is the only fuel supplier on that road; therefore the demand for fuel is high. Through this business he has supported two of his kids who are in junior high school. He believes with this loan he would be more resourced to save more in supporting his kids in school.

They live in their home at 1534 Angel Sandoval street, in the Calama neighborhood of the city of El Alto.  \r\n\r\nJenny sells humintas and anticuchos.  A huminta is a traditional empanada from the western part of Bolivia and is made with corn and cheese. Anticuchos are skewers with cow's heart, potato and peanuts. Jenny goes out to sell her products every day.

She works very hard every day for when the right moment arrives to harvest her products and sell them in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.

Looking forward, she hopes to put a stand in the market as she as sure that in this way she will improve her earnings.  This is her ninth loan with MFP.  She knows that she has to be punctual in her payments as she has been with her previous loans.  In her communal bank she is a supportive member and is very committed to the growth of the group.

She acquired a working capital through private and very expensive loans, which have been completely cancelled today. She thought of this idea because her husband is a taxi driver and he was the only one earning an income for the family's needs. Their family is made up of them both and their 6 children, between the ages of 2 and 17. Today, Margarita generates an income which helps with the household expenses and she feels very happy to earn more every day. She currently plans on increasing her sales and she is applying for her first loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). Her Kiva loan will be used to purchase ingredients in larger quantities and to purchase tools to modernize her fried foods business. She will give a better presentation to her clients and she aspires to increase her sales profits so that they are no less than 30%. Her dream is to have her own house and to expand her business so that in the future she will have savings. This will help her provide her children with a quality education for a successful future.

There are a total of 144 households and farms in the village, and raising livestock and climbing palm trees are the main sources of income. The village is suffering from a water shortage because there is only one community water basin for village usage, and it is difficult to store the water in the rainy season. They are now fundraising money to re-dig that water basin after this crop season. As all of the villagers are Buddhists, they must save for regular cultural ceremonies, such as providing provisions to monks.\r\n\r\nThe new loan will help those borrowers to buy fertilizer and hire laborers for their peanut, pigeon pea, and green gram farms.  These days, labor charges are higher, and farmers have to spend a lot of money to finish weeding and harvesting. It costs about $100 to hire the labor necessary to cultivate one acre. In addition to spending on farming inputs, some borrowers aspire to use the loan to raise livestock, such as goats and cows. Not only do these animals help on their farm, but their manure can be used as a natural fertilizer, helping farmers save money on expensive chemical fertilizer.\r\n\r\nPictured above are the committee members from the CBO: U Sein, U Win, U Soe, U Aung, U Kyaw, Daw Phyu, Daw Thuzar, Daw Khin, and Daw YeYe.

He returned to Mozambique after the general peace agreement terminated a 16-year conflict and brought with him a truck allowing him to transport freight and passengers from Catembe to the South African border. He worked with this vehicle for many years, and it broke down at the end of 2000. Beginning in 2001 he worked as a driver, no longer self-employed. With the money earned as a driver we was able to purchase another smaller freight vehicle to transport freight from his small grocery store.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been managing her own ready-to-wear clothing store for the past few years.\r\n\r\nMary Jane has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends its weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her clothing business.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Mary Jane would like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by buying new designs of products to be incorporated into her current inventory.\r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":569720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His mixed farm, which is located in Kitale town, western Kenya, produces milk and eggs which he sells to the local market. He mainly depends on the income from his farming activities to cater for the basic needs of his family. His biggest challenge has been diseases and difficulties in transporting his products to the local market. \r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo of 31,200 KES in order to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says that his milk production will improve and that his family will have enough milk for domestic consumption and sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Almost all of the five children brought up by her are now grown-ups. Her two daughters and two sons live separately as they have their own families. Only her little son stays with his parents as he is still a college student.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, her husband farms land and raises livestock. As to Sainaya, she keeps two cows and sells their milk to the locals. Actually, one of her cows was given to her by her father and mother-in-law as a wedding gift. Now this gift lets her make $45 a month. Raising cattle has allowed them to marry two of their sons and even increase the total population.\r\n\r\nSainaya has far-going plans. The first obstacle is getting a loan. Once it is overcome, she plans to buy two calves which she is going to fatten up for resale. As she sells them, she intends to invest the money in buying a flat for her daughter in Tokmok city. After fulfilling this plan she will be able to finish building her house, which is now under construction.\r\n\r\nHere is Sainaya\u2019s team \u2013 Rosa, Chynarkan and Kulbubu:\r\n\r\nRosa is a widow and is the mother of five children. She manages to keep a cow, a horse and five sheep. She is happy to have married her three daughters, despite her low income. Rosa wants to buy a cow. However, without a loan she won\u2019t be able to do that.\r\n\r\nChynarkan, 47, is the mother of five children, most of whom go to college. This is quite burdensome since neither she nor her husband have a good income. They mainly live by keeping cattle. Chynarkan needs a loan to buy a foal which, after feeding for one year, they plan to resell.\r\n\r\nKulbubu, 48, is a widow. She has brought up six children, some of whom help her now. She keeps two cows and sells milk which helps her make $20 a month, enough to sustain her for a month. She hopes to get a loan and buy a calf.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

More specifically, he lives in the district of Tonghor, which is an area very close to the sea and is inhabited primarily by fishermen. He has been a member of the U-IMCEC Yoff credit union since February 2006. He is married and has 6 children, whose ages very between 2 and 15 years. After his primary education, he took on the job of his parents, and has been involved in this activity for more than 30 years. For him, the most attractive aspect of his occupation is the realization of significant profits that allow him to provide for himself and his family. Mr. T. is seeking a loan of 200,000 FCFA with the goal of repairing his equipment and canoe. Thus, this credit will allow him to make his business more profitable, and thereby improve his family's standard of living.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

Olimjon is 24 years old. He is a livestock trader. He buys and sells cattle from different market places and has been in the business for the last eight years.

With the loan from Kiva, he plans to increase his herd of cattle for trade and, if possible, open up his own butchery. This, he says, will increase his turnover.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sus sue\u00f1os a nivel personal son acceder a una situaci\u00f3n socioecon\u00f3mica m\u00e1s estable y una vida m\u00e1s confortable. \nIdilia est\u00e1 muy agradecida del cr\u00e9dito brindado por Fondo esperanza, ya que \u00e9ste le ha permitido invertir en su negocio, lo que le ha generado mayores ganancias. Respecto a las reuniones estas son muy amenas y ha logrado generar v\u00ednculos de amistad con las dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo. Idilia tambi\u00e9n ha podido incorporar en su negocio los aprendizajes de ventas en las reuniones, ya que registra sus gastos e ingresos y cotiza los precios cuando debe comprar. \nIndependencia es una de las 34 comunas que componen la ciudad de Santiago (capital de Chile), ubicada en el sector centro-norte. Surgi\u00f3 a fines del siglo XIX como un sector tradicional de la ciudad. Su eje principal es la Av. Independencia, por la cual pasaba el antiguo Camino del Inca, puerta de entrada por el norte, a la ciudad de Santiago. Dada su amplia poblaci\u00f3n ind\u00edgena, en Independencia se encuentra el Centro Cultural Ind\u00edgena de Chile. Cuenta tambi\u00e9n con importantes construcciones hist\u00f3ricas, entre ellas 6 monumentos hist\u00f3ricos de Chile.\n","en":"Idilia is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cEl Progresso\u201d which is in the community of Independencia in the city of Santiago.  She is a merchant who sells candy and beverages from a street cart, Monday through Friday.  Idilia also sells jewelry from her home and on Sundays she sells olives.  Saturdays are designated for buying merchandise to stock her candy business.  She buys her merchandise at the central market in the city of Santiago since the prices are the most affordable.\r\n<p>\r\nIdilia has been in business for 20 years.  She started out selling olives and condiments.  This loan will be used to buy a cooler, merchandise to restock her business, and an awning for protection from the rain since the one she currently uses is in bad condition.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer goals include selling her products from an established location, such as a kiosk, but she first needs to obtain a permit.  She also hopes that her business will prosper by adding handicrafts made of clay to her inventory.  Idilia is motivated to continue with her business and include new products.  The income she earns enables her to cover her household expenses.  She lives with her daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren.  Her goals on a personal level are to achieve a more stable socioeconomic situation and to live a more comfortable life.\r\n<p>\r\nIdilia is very grateful for the loan provided by Fondo Esperanza because the funds allow her to invest in her business and generate more income.  She says the Communal Bank meetings are very pleasant and have enabled her to form friendships with the other group members.  Idilia also has incorporated into her business the sales techniques she learned from the meetings.  She also tracks her expenses, income, and the quoted prices of her purchases.  \r\n<p>\r\nIndependencia is one of the 34 communities that make of the city of Santiago, the Chilean capital.  It is located in the north-central section.  Independencia emerged in the late nineteenth century as a traditional section of the city.  The main street is Independencia Avenue, which crosses the old Inca Trail, the gateway to the north in the city of Santiago.  Given its large indigenous population, Independencia is known as the \u201cIndigenous Cultural Center\u201d of Chile.  There are also important historical buildings, including six Chilean landmarks.

an entrepreneur from Kurgantube, Tajikistan where he lives with his wife and three children, has been in the grocery business for 12 years. He is requesting a loan of 5000 TJS to buy foodstuffs in order to generate additional profits. Very good with finances, Makhmadrasul knows how to manage money and make the right investments. We believe the current loan will allow him to maintain a good product selection and continue to earn an adequate income to support himself and his family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a very kind and hard-working man who lives in his own home together with his wife, 29 year-old Mar\u00eda, and his two beloved children, 10 year-old Mois\u00e9s and 1 year-old Jack, who he would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nFor Jhonny, long work days are part of his routine.  He wakes up at 6 o'clock in the morning and, together with his motorcycle taxi, he goes out in search of customers who would like to arrive quickly and safely at their destinations.  After driving through the streets of the city of Pucallpa all day, at 10 o'clock at night he puts his vehicle away and rests, knowing that another long day of work awaits him the next day.\r\n\r\nWhat Jhonny most enjoys about his work is chatting to his passengers and making their trip more pleasant.  He has been in this business for 15 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be having to work all day away from his family.  Over time, he would like to set up a store for his wife to run.\r\n\r\nThis is Jhonny's second loan from MFP and he has never had any problems in making his repayments.  He always saves up so that he can make his repayments on time.  He is a very well-liked member of his community bank who always arrives very punctually.  He will use the 1,000 Peruvian soles he is requesting to buy new seats for his vehicle since the ones he has right now are very worn."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":805462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy seats for his motorcycle taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-09T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhonny ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":153.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":155.79},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":162.23},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":170.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":175.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":182.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.57,"local_amount":153.51,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":158.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719246},{"amount":317.43,"local_amount":846.49,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":871.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350709}],"funded_date":"2011-07-16T18:20:30Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":317887,"name":"Ibtihaj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ibtihaj is a 41-year-old woman who is married and has two sons and two daughters.

She started her business out of economic pressure six years ago, as her husband\u2019s salary wasn\u2019t enough to cover the family\u2019s expenses. She began to investigate the types of work she could do, and one of her friends recommended that she sell children\u2019s clothing. She decided to try it. Little by little, she brought in more clients, and her income increased as she sold more clothing. Rahima is applying for a loan of $700 USD to purchase merchandise to fill existing client orders, which she is offering to repay in 5 months. <P>\r\n\r\nShe hopes that you will collaborate with her.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.<P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\n<B>IMON's History<\/B>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":289456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase clothing to fill client orders","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Dushanbe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.56 68.773889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T19:52:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.03},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.03},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.89},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.85},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":132.29,"local_amount":132.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":132.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35997637},{"amount":136.03,"local_amount":136.03,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:00:16Z","rounded_local_amount":136.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44580419},{"amount":139.89,"local_amount":139.89,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":139.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52973942},{"amount":143.85,"local_amount":143.85,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T15:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":143.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63193837},{"amount":147.94,"local_amount":147.94,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T17:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":147.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73621694}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T23:33:09Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T17:14:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Cicero","image":100308}},{"id":99889,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elizabeth es socia del Bancomunal  Las Surcanitas.\nElizabeth es conviviente tiene 40 a\u00f1os, cuatro hijos de 20, 17,15 y 11 a\u00f1os, los tres \u00faltimos est\u00e1n en la escuela estatal, y el mayor est\u00e1 estudiando estudios en un instituto.\nElizabeth vende en el mercado s\u00e1bado y domingo, en un triciclo tazones pl\u00e1stico, jarras y otros, en la semana ella vende golosinas  tiene un  puesto, cada d\u00eda sus hijas le ayudan en las ventas de golosinas..   \nElizabeth necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 2600 soles, para la compra de bisuter\u00eda  que va a vender en una feria.\nDesde que est\u00e1 en finca, ha podido lograr muchas cosas, antes vend\u00eda golosinas, ahora tiene m\u00e1s capital para invertir, su econom\u00eda ha mejorado.  \nEl sue\u00f1o de Elizabeth es tener una tienda grande, tipo minimarket.  \n","en":"Elizabeth is a member of the \u201cLas Surcanitas\u201d comunal bank.

For about six years Askar with his wife have been selling food on the farmer market in the Djaboor-Rasulov region. He travels to the town of Khujand for the goods twice a week. The goods that sell well at this time is sugar and pastas. The season for fruits has begun and the women are getting ready and stocking up for the winter for jams and compotes. Besides that it is the season when farmers work on the land and many residents have relocated to their farms. They stock up with food such as pasta so that they don't have to travel to the markets too often. This is why Askar decided to use the loan to buy sugar and pasta.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":338309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy six bags of sugar and three bags of pasta","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.Rasulov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Askar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":120369,"name":"Khem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khem R., 28, is a married woman and the mother of one lovely young child who is of school age.

She frequently travels to surrounding towns to sell her well-crafted curtains and bedding which are in high demand.

Right now she makes all of her products from her house, but she has a dream of one day of having her own store with multiple employees helping her sew. \r\n\r\nAmelia is now an independent woman and instead of depending on her children, she is able to provide for them.

His wife works and does whatever she can to help pay for water and electricity.  They live in the Hialeah neighborhood of the capital city of Managua.  Jeovany\u2019s goals include building a house.  He is a hardworking man and a good father who wants to provide security and protection for his family.  Currently he works as a messenger for a design firm and has been at this job for six month.  He previously worked as a security guard, but his salary alone was not enough to feed his family.  Jeovany has had difficulties in the past finding stable employment.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from AFODENIC, he will buy construction materials such as cement, iron, and concrete blocks so that he can build his house.  The modest structure his family currently lives in is made of zinc and wooden planks.  The existing materials are old, so he needs to tear them down so that he can build reinforced walls that will give his family a decent home where they can sleep a bit more securely.  Jeovany thanks the Institution for making possible the dream of any father to provide his children with a roof over their heads and basic necessities. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow four times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: Sari-sari (general)store, rice retailer and sugar cane businesses. Her husband Ramonito, who is 57 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 27 to 32 years old. Natividad joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Natividad has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 8000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her Sari-sari Store so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and improve her family's living conditions. Natividad is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing \"motorela\" or \"habal-habal\" (motorcycle taxi) services to local community members. Silvestre has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Silvestre joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Silvestre has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. Silvestre is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools needed for the maintenance of the service. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Silvestre from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Seeking a way to provide for her family, Gulzara, with the support of her father, is starting her own business raising livestock.

At that time, with a goal of being able to offer the best to her daughter, she decided to open a little grocery store.  This shop has turned out to be profitable and very useful for her neighbors as well because thanks to the variety of merchandise she can cater to and please everyone.  After 10 years of dedicating herself entirely to her daughter, she decided to give herself a second opportunity and now has two children at her side, which provide her a double motive to continue making efforts in life.

With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

The group is made up of six members who know one another and are neighbors.  Ms. Emelia invited them to get together and they agreed to request their first loan from Fundacion Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe representative of this group is Ms. Adela B. R..  She is 40 years old and educated through the third year of secondary school.  She has four children (three boys and one girl).  Cesar is 19, Soledad is 14, Francisco is 12, and Alexis is 6 years old.  Adela sells shirts and napkins.  She is requesting this loan to buy shirts and napkins.  She started this business six years ago out of economic necessity and in order to send her children to school.  \r\n\r\nHer uncle makes crocheted tops and napkins from yarn.  She sells the merchandise in her community of Hueyapan by going from house to house offering her goods.  Her daughter helps her to collect payment from customers who owe her money.  The business has helped to feed her family and to pay her children's school expenses.  With her earnings, she buys more tops and napkins.  She would like to improve her kitchen, as she currently has only a provisional kitchen with just a roof.  She hopes to achieve this by selling more shirts and napkins.\r\n\r\nIn her community of Hueyapan, the climate is cool and there are many fruits, such as pears, chokecherries, peaches, and plums.  There is a lot of vegetation like trees, pine trees, and very beautiful flowers.  There are also many animals, like lambs, goats, etc.  Ms. Adela B.
