she divorced her husband 34 years ago, all of a sudden Genara faced the responsibility of caring for her five children by herself. As time went on, the sale of clothing she herself made was no longer enough to support her family. For that reason, in 1983, she decided to open a general store. Things were going well, but lack of time forced her to close the business since she needed to take care of her younger children. Because of this she continued making clothing and worked in whatever other business appeared at the time, such as the sale of fish, sale of food, etc.<p>\r\nThree years ago, one of her daughters suggested that she reopen the store. Since she had continued to pay the yearly business license fee to her city, it was no problem to reopen. Because of this, thanks to her daughter\u00b4s support and a loan from EDAPROSPRO, she able to open the store again.<p>\r\nWith a lot of effort, Genera gets ahead in her business. Fortunately her children are grown now and help her once in a while. However, she thinks about growing the business even more because now she needs to take care of two illnesses which she suffers from, diabetes and osteoporosis.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCon el divorcio de su esposo, hace treinta y cuatro a\u00f1os, Genara, de pronto, se vio con la responsabilidad de cuidar a sus cinco hijos ella sola. Conforme pasaba  el tiempo, la venta de ropa que ella misma confeccionaba no era suficiente para mantener a su hogar. Por ello, en el a\u00f1o 1983 decidi\u00f3 abrir una bodega. Todo iba yendo bien, pero la falta de tiempo la obligo a cerrar el negocio, pues deb\u00eda ocuparse de atender a sus hijos menores a\u00fan. As\u00ed que contin\u00fao con la confecci\u00f3n de ropas y alguno que otro negocio que se le presentaba en el momento, como la venta de pescados, venta de comidas, etc. <p>\r\nHace tres a\u00f1os, una de sus hijas le propuso volver a abrir la tienda.

Por otro lado considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda dentro de su tienda, sin poder salir a la calle a realizar otras actividades.

She lives independently in the house that she inherited from her parents and what she desires most is to improve her quality of life.  In the district of Nu\u00f1oa (district of the province of Meglar of the department of Puno), Bersy has her own grocery store. She is very happy with her business since it is very profitable. She has been working in this business for 20 years and what she likes best about it is talking with her customers and finding out what is happening in her neighborhood. On the other hand, what she considers most difficult about her job is having to stay inside her shop all day, without being able to go out on the street to carry out other activities. In the near future she hopes to have a bigger store where she can better attend to her customers and offer them a larger variety of products. For this she knows that she has to work very hard and without rest. This is Bersy\u2019s 9th loan with MFP \u2013 she knows that she has to pay it back on time and she is determined to do so. In her village bank she is very responsible and is always waiting for agreements to be fulfilled between partners. With the 3500 nuevos soles requested, she will buy more products to improve her grocery store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":347173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase in merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bersy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3501.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733976}],"funded_date":"2009-07-23T04:46:14Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelley Maynard","image":248986}},{"id":124109,"name":"Omoregie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omoregie O. is 31 years old.

and has two children.  In search of a consistent income for her children, Shakhlohon became involved in animal husbandry ten years ago.  Thanks to her hard work and persistence, she was able to develop her farm to yield a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS) and have four cows and two heifers today.  To find an additional source of profit for her family, entrepreneurial Shakhlohon also started to sell clothing at the local market, and this allows her to cover daily expenses.  To further develop her animal husbandry business, she requested a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase cattle.  In the future, Shakhlohon plans to prepare a good dowry for her daughter, thanks to the profits from the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":875656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is grateful to God and her mother for the attention she has received, and for being able to have a normal life. Nothing is impossible for Olivia because she has a well established goal which she is determined to achieve, confronting whatever obstacle which may present itself. Her greatest dream in life is to provide an education and a better quality of life to her son Cristian than that which she received. Her disability is not an obstacle for her to be able to achieve her goal. She works selling catalog beauty products from recognized businesses in Mexico. The way she works is by going door to door offering the products she sells. In this way, she is able to cover the costs of her and her son\u2019s basic necessities. She lives in her mother\u2019s house, along with another brother, and is looking to have her own space in which she and her son will be able to improve their quality of life. For this reason she requests the loan to begin the construction of a room."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":945964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T05:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5247.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":282.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":303.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":327.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":352.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":408.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":439.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":472.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":509.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":548.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":590.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":635.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21.52,"local_amount":282.31,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":298.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392334},{"amount":23.17,"local_amount":303.91,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":321.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704742},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":327.16,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":345.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270008966},{"amount":26.85,"local_amount":352.19,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":372.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276618108},{"amount":28.9,"local_amount":379.13,"processed_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T13:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":400.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283110030},{"amount":31.11,"local_amount":408.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":431.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287044510},{"amount":33.49,"local_amount":439.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":464.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294546846},{"amount":36.05,"local_amount":472.96,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":500.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301370153},{"amount":163.11,"local_amount":2139.85,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2262.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308382491},{"amount":10.87,"local_amount":142.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-24T09:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332843064}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T15:33:56Z","paid_date":"2013-01-24T09:45:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim O'Reilly","image":null}},{"id":374949,"name":"Philip","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philip is a 29-year-old food kiosk owner in Mombasa. \r\n\r\nHe is single and has been operating this business for the past three years and he is doing great.

Although he only has a primary education, he has been able to be successful in cattle ranching and rice cultivation. After working in his father's ranch as a young man, he decided to acquire his own land and start his own family. He has 8 children ages 20, 18, 17, 16, 14, 7, 5 and 1. His older children have already finished their studies and work with him on the ranch while his other kids are still in school. Along with rice cultivation he will also make some investment in cattle with the loan. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ivan is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount that is missing. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":17103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest

She is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GM Senablo of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land.<P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, C\u00e9line S. A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1 hectare, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1 hectare in maize (corn) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e9line","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821560},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357826},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046876},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938494},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396160},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904037},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126045}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:21:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83165,"name":"Alaine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaine S., 19, is single with  children.

For societal reasons (his parents' extreme poverty), he decided to drop out of school (at age 15) to earn an income in order to help his parents provide for the family.  After several years of all kinds of commerce, he decided in the end to get settled in selling various shop goods in his district.  With his four years of experience, he has a good command of his business. \r\n\r\nTo expand his working capital, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and is on his first individual loan.  He intends to buy various shop goods in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers.  And he'll make his sales to a rich and varied customer base out of his shop located in Massablacoura. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he hopes to realize a monthly profit of 25,000 francs CFA for expanding his shop and for meeting the needs of the family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la crianza y venta de carneros y cuyes y paralelamente realiza todo tipo de artesan\u00edas, entre alfombras, telares, chompas, etc. En esta actividad tambi\u00e9n ocupa bastante tiempo, porque le gusta y aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven.\nDesde entonces, esta actividad tambi\u00e9n le genera buenas ganancias y le gusta mucho, ya que hace hermosos telares de distintos colores y texturas.\nPara el futuro tiene pensado sembrar en mayor cantidad y migrar de la zona donde vive para probar suerte en otras tierras donde tiene familiares, pero continuar con la agricultura.\n\nEste es el primer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y est\u00e1 seguro que cumplir\u00e1 con cada pago porque quiere pedir otros cr\u00e9ditos para seguir adelante con todos sus sue\u00f1os. El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de abono y fertilizantes para dar el tratamiento adecuado a sus tierras, y tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 m\u00e1s carneros y cuyes para seguir con su negocio.","en":"Fortunato is 54 years old and lives with his wife Lidia, age 52, and their youngest two sons, who are twins: Juber and Jhonny, both age 16. The rest of their sons are married and have their own families.\r\n\r\nThis cheerful man can be described as \"multi-functional\", as he currently works in various trades and is very dedicated to each. He began in farming, which still occupies a large part of his time today, growing potatoes, barley, and peas, which turn a good profit. His twin sons help him with the farming, but only when they have time, since they are still in school. Fortunato also raises and sells rams and guinea pigs, and produces different types of textiles including carpets, weavings, sweaters, etc. This work also occupies a lot of his time, because he learned to create woven products when he was very young and likes the work.\r\n\r\nSince then, this work has also generated good income and he really enjoys making beautiful weavings that have distinctive colors and textures. In the future he plans to plant greater quantities and move away from where he currently lives to try his luck farming in a different region where he has relatives.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan from MFP and Fortunato is sure he will make each payment because he wants to qualify for future loans to continue progress toward his dreams. The money he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of manure and fertilizers to properly cultivate his crops. He will also acquire more rams and guinea pigs to continue his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":458576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of manure and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-27T07:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":128.77},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":139.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":148.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":158.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":163.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":177.48},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":182.24},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":189.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":198.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.77},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.43},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.07,"local_amount":128.77,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124388},{"amount":48.77,"local_amount":139.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960129},{"amount":50.73,"local_amount":144.93,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":146.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992973},{"amount":52,"local_amount":148.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":149.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717759},{"amount":55.51,"local_amount":158.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751435},{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":163.01,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":164.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933883},{"amount":58.27,"local_amount":166.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":167.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672773},{"amount":62.12,"local_amount":177.48,"processed_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":179.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886633},{"amount":63.78,"local_amount":182.24,"processed_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":183.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153779},{"amount":66.43,"local_amount":189.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":191.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449188},{"amount":140.26,"local_amount":400.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":404.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182587950}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T15:35:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":169479,"name":"Claudia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  Se\u00f1ora Claudia del Socorro M.

She has her hand raised in the photograph, she is a client of the sixteenth cycle, and she is 37 years old, married, and mother of 5 children all of whom attend school. Her husband has a small business, a pharmacy at Butembo, a commercial town situated in the Lubero territory which is over 410 kilometres from Goma\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana sells second hand shoes at the central market of Virunga,she set up  her small business with her own money ,a sum of about 50$ that she received from her husband. At that time she was selling fritters. After the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano from the 16th to the 17th of February 2002 which completely destroyed the economy and the basic infrastructure of the town of Goma, and of which she was one of the victims, she decided to change her activity and sell second hand shoes. She has been doing this for 8 years. With the loan from the IMF Hekima, Jeannine Kabuo Tahirana hopes to increase her turnover by buying 75 pairs of used shoes .The main challenge of this activity is that the sale of merchandise (buying of shoes) depends on the availability of money (the revenue of the population).In addition the competition of shoes made in Uganda\/Kampala disrupts the prices.\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana also practises small artisan activities, she weaves carpets to increase her income. In 10 years time, she hopes to become a wholesaler and no longer a small retailer. She aims to obtain her stock from the big commercial centre in either Kampala or Butembo.\r\nIn addition, Jeannine Kabuo Tahirana is a tenant, she would like to buy a piece of land and build on it since her husband works a long way away from her, and this would allow her to reduce the burden of the family expenses.\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana is grateful to the IMF Hekima for the loans that she receives without any physical security ,for thanks to these loans she can manage to provide for her children. This Twende Mbele group is made up of 14 women members one of whom is ill (J. Matunda) and E. Kavira who are not on the group photograph, which is why there are only 12 clients on the photograph.\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Barbara Belli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":592478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of 75 pairs of used shoes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She did so  primarily to help her grow her sari-sari store. She opted to purchase rice, assorted groceries, and soft drinks. Also, she plans to buy an additional computer for her computer shop and some computer software.\r\n\r\nEmily takes it a personal challenge to keep going on with her business and unceasingly pray for its growth. Nevertheless, she knows that with the Lord by her side there is nothing to worry about. She intends to save her profits and invest in another business in preparation for the future of her family because for her, success is something you don\u2019t simply wait for; you have to make it happen.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she has received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":710801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is the most important inheritance Binodira and her husband can give to their five dear children.  They are both very responsible parents and they work very hard in agriculture and farming so that they can give their children the opportunity to finish school \u2013 an opportunity they never had due to poor finances. \r\n\r\nThis happy mother has been working in agriculture since getting married and, with the unconditional help of her husband, she buys and sells cattle in order to cover the family\u2019s most urgent needs.  Even so, she now finds herself with more expenditures and she would like a loan in order to increase their capital by increasing their production. \r\n\r\nBinodira and her family are waiting for your quick response. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.  \r\n\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With more inventory, it will be much easier for these women to attract clients, and the higher profits will enable them to make their lives better."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":356847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy material for production and to buy products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2400,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Rosmeri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea Venancia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4021.66},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4122.2},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4225.26},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4330.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":577.96},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":592.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":622.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1170.37,"local_amount":8143.86,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8216.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73598837},{"amount":607.22,"local_amount":4225.26,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4262.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87034410},{"amount":622.41,"local_amount":4330.88,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4369.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946611}],"funded_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:52Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T20:59:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":128240,"name":"Mrs. Phan Surn Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phan S. is the group leader of a six-member group, all of whom are living in Sam Raong village in Takeo province.\r\n\r\nMrs. Phan S. is 43 years old and the mother of three children who are all attending the local school.

Rosario has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosario joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosario is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers and feed. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rosario from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She tells us that the idea for her business was born from the lack of water to irrigate the plantings in the area. The farmers have made wells and they irrigate their crops with them. In order to do this, they have to use motors, which need gasoline to work.  \r\n\r\nThis business has brought her additional income which are a big help for the family's support. Her husband, like most of the men in the area, works as an agricultural laborer and what he makes is not enough to support the family economy. \r\n\r\nMaria Angelita wishes to grow her business with the purchase of more fuel and oil, with which she can continue to attend to the demand for her product. Due to this she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles.

They decided to quit their studies. Her elder two work in a local factory on monthly wages. The next son is a daily wage laborer in the wooden market. Now, with the income, they are helping their younger siblings to achieve their education. Their two younger brothers read in 2nd standard and their sister reads in 3rd standard.\r\n\r\nSafia is also a very hardworking lady. She prepares embroidered dresses by receiving the orders from her neighbors and thereby earns income. She saves her income for her children's good futures. She has a wish that her financial condition will improve so that her elder sons also can continue their education. Her husband is a fruit vendor. He sells fruit by going to different areas of the community on his four-wheeled cart. He has been doing this work for over 10 years. \r\n\r\nSafia has successfully repaid her three previous loans to Asasah (microfinance institute in Pakistan and a partner of Kiva) and is now applying

She is 39 years old. Orly is married and has 2 infant children. To make a living, Orly owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) store, selling food and daily-use products in the local community. Orly has been engaged in her business for more than 3 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Orly joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Orly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as working capital, and to purchase additional inventory. Orly is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Orly from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Isio, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling fruit and vegetables and hog raising. Her husband Ernisto, who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between five and 30 years old. \r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy stocks of fruits and vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Wilma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She lives with her mother, brother and sisters. She sells food products. In the past, she used to travel to the neighboring countries to stock up on clothing and cosmetics, which she sold on credit to clients who would pay her back within a month. Many unpaid debts have forced her to stop this business. She has opened a small shop in front of her home in order to sell foodstuffs. She has been struggling to provide for the hefty expenses of food, healthcare and clothing for herself and her family. These difficulties have led her to open an account with IMCEC, where she obtained two loans, in the amount of 300,000 francs and 100,000 francs, repaid fully without delays. Now, after having been able to put aside 52,399 francs, she is seeking another loan of 200,000 francs in order to bolster her business. She plans to buy 10 bags of onions, 10 bags of cabbage, five bags of peppers, three cartons of local tomatoes, two bags of soap and two bags of sugar. She hopes that expending her stock will increase her income, allowing her to improve the family\u2019s nutrition, and also cover the expenses related to healthcare and clothing. Her goal is to build a big grocer store in her house, which is located on the side of a big road.

Both incomes have allowed them to cover all the needs of the family. They presently want to finish the walls and be able to lock the house to make it safer.

Ketut Murni ikut dalam kelompok ternak babi yang bekerja sama dengan Dinari yang jangka waktunya selama 6 bulan dan akan melakukan pelunasan diakhir periode. Sekarang Ketut Murni sudah mempunyai 2 induk dengan 10 ekor anaknya. Harapannya dengan pinjaman yang diperoleh dari Dinari Ketut Murni akan membangun sebuah kandang yang permanen, sehingga babinya bisa sehat dan bertumbuh dengan baik.","en":"Although a kindergarten teacher, Ketut Murni still has time to raise pigs. Ketut Murni always helps her husband, Gusti Made Dana,  who works as a driver. Ketut Murni raises pigs with an initial capital of  Rp.1,000,000. (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp9,000-10,000.00). Ketut Murni bought 4 piglets to be fattened. Ketut Murni raise these piglets for 6 months, and could buy for  Rp.800,000 and sell for  Rp.1,000,000\/pig. Profit is Rp. 50,000\/pig after decucting feed cost. Ketut Murni  feed her pigs 2x\/day mornings and evenings. Besides feeding rice and wheat clippings, she also fed banana, talas leaves, and banana trunks. Before feeding she bathe the pigs until clean, and also clean the stall.

Since she was young, she had the inclination to care and protect animals. However, she never imagined that, pushed by necessity, she would have to sacrifice her precious little pigs, as she has called them since she was young. Approximately eight years ago, she became dedicated to purchasing pigs. She feeds them the leftovers from the potato harvest and, later, special food called purina that costs 60 soles per bag that feeds three pigs for 20 days. Once they're fat, she slaughters them on Wednesdays or Saturdays each week so that she can take the meat that her customers expect to the market on fair days, Thursdays and Sundays. For Delia, this business is very profitable since for every pig, she earns between 100 and 150 soles. Her only difficulty is when she has to carry the purchase herself. This is her third consecutive loan with MFP and, over all this time, she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments. With the money that she is requesting, she willl buy food for her pigs. Delia is very thankful to all of you who allow her to access this loan.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":253326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase food for her pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T20:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":321.46,"local_amount":989.12,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1000.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595393},{"amount":653.54,"local_amount":2010.88,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989633}],"funded_date":"2009-01-12T00:04:41Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":87294,"name":"Danaya (La Confiance).

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  \r\n\r\nWhile the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

by poverty alone, working to enable her two children to survive. Now she is 55 years of age and still facing a lot of adversities in life that sometimes makes her weak. However, the thought of her children having low educational attainment and less opportunity to get a good employment enables her to regain strength to continue fighting and win the battle against poverty. Her eldest child is 31 years old and has an income from driving a tricycle (a motorcycle with a sidecar that is used as people\u2019s means of transportation), which Rita bought using a previous loan; her younger child is 27 years old and a waiter. \r\n<p>\r\nStill, Rita wants to have her own business and help her children. She hopes that her business of fattening cattle (a cow can be sold for as much double its price after two to three years) will grow and becomes sustainable someday through loans she can obtain from ASHI with the support of its partner, Kiva. Rita knew that, because she is poor, her children have nothing to inherit when her life is over, but having a sustainable business for them to manage and continue will enable them to be more secure in their own lives."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":435532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They have two children, Luis, 19, and Melody, 12.  Six years ago Marisa and her husband decided to start a hardware business.   They located their shop in a central area of the city which is always busy.  In the beginning they suffered a lot, not earning enough to even pay their rent.  Marisa's husband began to offer and resell their products to other hardware stores for a minimal profit, never imagining that this model would actually be so successful.   Now, Marisa doesn't work in the shop, as she is busy handling the billing and processing of the orders they receive.  Sometimes it's so busy she counts on the help of one of her nephews, usually in the afternoons when there are more customers.  For the future, Marisa would like to set up another location.  Their model works well and she would like to build the business and help bring more financial security to her children.

Antonia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Antonia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antonia is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the first loan taken out by Antonia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Rasumani belongs to Kulithalai, in rural Tamil Nadu. She is a 48 year old lady who works as a daily wage laborer in the agricultural sector. She has three members in her family including two children. Her monthly saving is Rs.850 only and the monthly medical expense is around Rs.150. She has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. Her family is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, her family is forced to walk a kilometer just to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. The family members, especially their women & daughters are subsequently at risk of infection, molestation, and even insect or animal bites. <br \/><br \/>Joining hands with Selvarani, Parameshwari & Sathya whose families face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, she has formed a group of four members and is hoping to address this issue. So, together, the group seeks a loan of Rs. 56,000 to construct a toilet at home. This loan amount will cover the cost of raw materials and labor required. As they begin to enjoy the benefits of basic sanitation and their families improve in health, they will be able to save on medical expenses. Your loan will provide all four families access to improved hygiene and a better way of life."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1962920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She lives in Kitengela Township on the outskirts of the city of Nairobi. Besides offering computer services, Winfred does voluntary work within her community by visiting institutions that care for orphaned and vulnerable children, especially those that have been affected by HIV\/IADS. \r\n\r\nWinfred went through training in typing at the Salvation Army, a church sponsored institution that offers technical skills. Winfred had saved Ksh 20,000 USD 294 from her previous employment and together with Ksh 10,000 (USD 150), which her husband added Winfred was able to set up her business in 2003. \r\n\r\nWinfred offers a wide range of computer services such as typing and scanning. She also offers photocopying services. Winfred wants to expand her business by offering Internet services. She is therefore requesting for a loan of USD 1075, which will be given in kind, to enable her to purchase four computers and a wireless telephone set. This will result in better services for her clients whom she believe are going to increase in number.

S. is a 45-year-old market vendor.

Ibodat is standing to the right side and Vazira to the left.\r\nAs previously stated, Ibodat is a market vendor. Indeed, for more than ten years, she has been selling fruits and vegetables, including apricots, apples, strawberries, tomatoes, and cucumbers, in the central local market. Her oldest son helps Ibodat with the business. Ibodat begins her workday early each morning at 5:00 a.m. In practice, she buys vegetables and fruits from the local farmers, and she then sells such produce in the market, where she is well-known among the local shoppers because of her friendliness and the fact that she sells her fruits and vegetables for reasonable prices. Accordingly, Ibodat\u2019s business generates a stable, considerable income for her family. <p>\r\nNow, it is the prime season in which to sell fruits and vegetables, and (not surprisingly) her goods are in great demand. In addition, she wants to expand her business in order to generate even greater income to cover the higher education expenses that her darling children will soon need. For this reason, she is planning to purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables to sell in the market, and in order to do so she is seeking a loan in the amount of 1,500 Somoni ($450), to be repaid within 8 months. She asks that you lend your support to a dedicated mother so that she can make her children\u2019s dreams a reality because, with your help, this will be possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":165852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To capitalize on an increase in demand by purchasing additional fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-06-17T15:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibodat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-01T22:33:45Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-07-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269929},{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-08-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":299085},{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-09-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":329691},{"amount":57,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2008-10-17T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":197.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":363720},{"amount":53.25,"local_amount":177.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":184.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943228},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220326},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20409277},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:27:48Z","rounded_local_amount":194.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27102330}],"funded_date":"2008-06-17T22:33:45Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T19:27:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54523,"name":"Mayi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Originally from Bassar in the northwest of Togo, Mrs. Mayi K. was born on December 31, 1969 in Bassar.

She has worked as an executive secretary for the past two years in a private company called Detodo.Com.  She is 26 years old and lives in Lomas de Memorial Sandino, in Managua.  Her husband is a mason and they do not yet have children, but they want to have a worthy home for when they do.  This is her third loan with Afodenic.  She has made home improvements with her previous loans.  With this loan, she wants to invest in the infrastructure of her home: to replace the roof and to fix her room which is in bad shape.  She will buy zinc, beams, purlins and other building materials so that she can have peace of mind as she could not relax this past winter as everything was getting wet and had to be hung to dry.  Her goal is to continue her studies so that she can get a better job with better pay.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":253351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to replace her roof.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivania Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.35,"local_amount":671.06,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":725.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351558},{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":672.82,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":727.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038895},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":674.19,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":728.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929191},{"amount":36.68,"local_amount":677.12,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":731.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384103},{"amount":36.22,"local_amount":668.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":722.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890566},{"amount":36.62,"local_amount":676,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":730.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111864},{"amount":36.71,"local_amount":677.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":732.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533280},{"amount":36.29,"local_amount":669.93,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":723.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964658},{"amount":33.18,"local_amount":612.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":661.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875131}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T16:43:52Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":87310,"name":"Helena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helena O. is 30 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is responsible for a family, married, the father of two children. He is also responsible for two other relatives who are his wards. \r\n\r\nSince he did not succeed in his studies, he took up an apprenticeship as a tailor which is an activity he chose because he loves it. Thus, since 1994, he has been working full time at this trade, and four years ago he got his own workshop. He makes ready-to-wear and \"boubous\" (long flowing traditional robes worn by men and women) which are much in demand among Nigerians. \r\n\r\nMr. D. has been a member of the Baye Laye branch since May 2010. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs which will be totally used to fund the creation of ready-to-wear. This loan will bolster the working capital of Mr. D., who will then be able to meet the ever-growing demand of his clientele. The increase in profit will allow him to better support his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

But with the passage of time, her clientele grew and she started buying tools and professional accessories.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells beef during the morning to friends and neighbors in the neighborhood.  She sells it to them on credit and they repay weekly or biweekly.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan she has negotiated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to use it to remodel the floor in the room where her beauty salon operates and to buy more beef.\r\n\r\nThe two businesses together produce a monthly profit of approximately $700.000.  She dreams with setting up a great beauty salon in a different part of her residence with air conditioning and other comforts that will make it possible for her to offer better service.\r\n\r\nMost of

It is known for its rich pre-colonial culture.  It is also known for its handicrafts, which are recognized on a national and international level.  Most of the inhabitants here devote themselves to making buttons out of \u201ctagua\u201d (Tagua has been called 'vegetable ivory' because the hard tagua nut has a white endosperm similar to elephant ivory), handicrafts, and general commerce.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Bertha, age 65.  Several years ago her beloved husband died.  His death left her alone with their six children.  Now they are adults, and the youngest still lives in her house.\r\n\r\nShe is a very good housewife who searched for the way to get her children ahead.  She sells all types of clothes.  She works the last three days of the week, and she sells door to door.  She tells us that the majority of her sales are done through orders.  On these three days she makes sales, delivers orders, and collects because she extends credit.  She collects every two weeks.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in Guayaquil because that is where she gets a greater variety of products.  She has had this business for three years.

Growing up in Chimbote, Peru, his interest in business was piqued early by watching his parents. His father worked at a local restaurant while his mother sold vegetables and fruits. Oftentimes, he would join his mother on these pursuits and learned the tricks of the trade from her.\r\n\r\nHis parents\u2019 tremendous influence stayed with him as he moved from Peru to San Francisco in 2004. While working a series of miscellaneous jobs, Yeral\u2019s desire to open up his own business grew. However, as a recent immigrant, he didn\u2019t know how to get things started.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, his drive to become an entrepreneur propelled him to get into business the way he knew best:  Yeral began serving delicious Peruvian treats at food festivals.  In order to secure a spot at a Peruvian Food Festival, he needed a loan to pay the initial fee but when he turned to a major bank, he was refused credit because he did not have tax returns, a business license or a business bank account. \r\n\r\nWithout a set destination, he marched through San Francisco\u2019s Mission district, adamant that somewhere in the sea of pay-day loans and pawn shops, he would find a financial institution that would help him.  At last, he stumbled upon Opportunity Fund, where the staff recognized his potential and his passion.  Yeral got the cash he needed to capitalize his business, as well as a foothold into the mainstream American financial system.\r\n\r\nAt last year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival, Yeral sold over 400 plates of food and gained recognition for his talent making tasty Peruvian treats.  He wants to return again this year, and this time he expects to sell closer to 800 plates of food, doubling his business over last year. Yeral needs a second loan for $4,000 in order to buy more inventory and secure his spot at this year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival, which will be held in July.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Yeral devotes 50% of his time to expanding his business and he spends the other 50% working at a bar. He aims to expand his business so that one day he can devote 100% of his energy to serving delicious Peruvian treats.

","en":"Alex, age 37, lives in the rural village of Tapikilares in the San Francisco Yojoa municipality.  He has been married to his wife, Mirna, for 15 years.  The couple has three children; ages 15, 13, and 2.\r\n\r\nAlex grows corn, and he currently has two \u201cmanzanas\u201d (a land measurement unit equivalent to 7000 square meters or 1.728 acres) of land.  He learned this trade from his parents, who were farmers.  Alex has devoted himself to farming since he was a boy.  He continues with this business activity that he inherited in order to improve his family\u2019s standard of living.  His children also participate in the farming activities when they are not in school.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest Alex usually takes the corn to the market to sell and to trade.  When there is an abundance of corn the prices drop.  When there is a scarcity, Alex does not have to go to the market because the buyers come to look for corn in communities like his.  Alex takes advantage of this to raise his prices and get better income.\r\n\r\nAlex will use this loan for 5,000 lempiras to invest in farming.  This is the first loan that he has managed.  He hopes to continue with the farming activity in order to finish educating his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":910829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to invest in growing corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tapikilares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2011-11-06T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alex Omar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5211.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270120247}],"funded_date":"2011-11-13T22:06:08Z","paid_date":"2012-04-16T08:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":358627,"name":"Virgilio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgilio is 51 years old and is married with one child.
