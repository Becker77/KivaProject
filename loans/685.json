He is married. Marvin has three children whose ages are the following: his eldest son is 12 years old and is in his first year of secondary school. His other son is 10 years old and is in the 5th grade. His daughter is 8 years old and is the 4th grate. His life partner sells pastries and cosmetics. Marvin's goals are to increase his business enough to prevail since he always has been a person who does not neglect his responsibilities such as the support of his family. HIs dreams are to purchase a property for his children since where they live now belongs to his mother-in-law since they do not have the necessary resources to rent a house where they may live. He would also like to establish a pastry business for his wife since this would be a good fountain of income.\r\n\r\nMarvin's economic activity is selling general merchandise such as shorts, blouses, pants and underwear. He conducts business on foot. He's owned this business for nine years. Marvin started this business through family since, since he was young, his family taught him to earn money in an honest way. At the young age of 18, he began to sell products such as underwear and socks for men for which he traveled to different markets in search of customers to whom he could offer his merchandise. One of the most difficult things that he came across was starting without the support of his family. He decided to overcome this on his own and get his family ahead. His love for the work helped him obtain the business that he currently runs and for which he now needs a loan to purchase products since he thinks he will invest this money well so that his children will not have to go through the same difficulties that he encountered in order to support the business he possesses now.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":267641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-08T22:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marvin German ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":416.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.85,"local_amount":437.08,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":440.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092063},{"amount":19.81,"local_amount":396.26,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":399.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985445},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446061},{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":919.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":926.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956698},{"amount":16.53,"local_amount":330.85,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":333.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599724},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599725},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":419.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035614},{"amount":83.36,"local_amount":1666.64,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1679.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948017}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T04:22:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:41:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":91890,"name":"Lorelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorelyn F. is a rice grower.

His main crop is artichokes, one of the most common products in his location.  Every day he cares for his fields where he also planted potatoes a short while ago.  Juan insures that his plants are developing correctly and prevents illnesses and pests from attacking.  Currently, he also raises guinea pigs, for which he equipped space in his home.  Juan states that his parents are his main source of support but that he, too, is an important contributor to the household economy.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 47 years old, married and the mother of three children aged 30, 27 and 21, all of them out of school. She finished 7th grade but had to stop it due to lack of financial support. She left Maputo to go live in Boane and works as a cleaner at the University Instituto Politecnico since 1983. She has no employees and makes U$80 per month that she uses to support her housenold, and with the help of her husband she's able to save some in the bank.\r\n\r\nShe never had other loans and heard of Hluvuku through her neighbors that are also clients of the institution. This is her 6th loan in the amount of U$775 that she'll use to continue building her house. The previous loans were all for housing and consumer goods. She is committed to pay this one back in time as well, and hopefully apply for more loans in the future in order to build a new wall in her house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

It is located an hour and forty-five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor three years, she has been offering a cargo and passenger transportation service in a motorcycle taxi (a motorized vehicle that consists of a motorcylce with a cabin attached).  As the owner, she rents it out so that it can work the routes that link Olmos to different communities.  This activity constitutes an important income source for her family. \r\n\r\nThe continuous use of this vehicle and the poor condition of the roads in the area have caused the motorcyle taxi to undergo some serious problems that require some urgent repair to guarantee its correct use. That is why she has asked Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1500 nuevos soles that will help her acheive her goal. \r\n\r\nFelicita is a responsible and hardworking woman. Her greatest wish is to keep working to acquire one more vehicle with which she can make more income that will help her get her family ahead. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":561792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair and maintenance expenses for a motorcycle taxi.

Her husband, Jaime D., who is 59 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have thirteen children who are from 4 to 32 years old.\r\n\r\nBibingka is baked rice cake made from rice flour and coconut, while torta is anything dipped in egg-batter and deep fried. \r\n\r\nLiberata joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th loan, Liberata is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save for her plan to buy new equipment for her bibingka and torta business.\r\n\r\nLiberata is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Diosa has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Diosa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Diosa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Diosa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

\u201chandymen\u201d, as he calls it. His grandfather owned a welding shop and did repairs for people on the side. His father was also a well-known handyman in the Lubbock area. After the father\u2019s recent death, James and his wife used their savings and turned the family trade into an actual business, complete with a name and a logo, Lonestar Repair and Remodeling. Before James made this decision, he had worked for a variety of construction companies and was promoted quickly despite his young age. James says, \u201cI\u2019ve been in construction since I could swing a hammer\u201d. However, following in his father\u2019s footsteps, James was not happy working for other people and knew that his dream was to be self-employed. It was not too difficult to secure the first clients as they have been loyal customers to his family for years. James says, \u201cI live in Lubbock, known as the biggest small town. Whenever you do something, everybody knows about it and that can be a good thing and that can be a bad thing. But, for me, it\u2019s a good thing. Word of mouth is really what grows my company.\u201d \r\n\r\n\tWith this loan, James will buy a paint sprayer, a job-site table saw, two nail guns and a cordless multi-tool kit that will allow him to take on more complicated jobs. James employs his two younger brothers part-time but they both have other jobs. He is excited to expand his customer base so that  he can employ people full-time. With his wife at Wayland Baptist University studying to be a teacher, the couple are on a tight budget. Lucky for James, his wife is an \u201cextreme budgeter\u201d and can make a dollar stretch. James\u2019 marketing plan is to be an honest businessman with a good work ethic. He believes that through word of mouth, people will choose him because of his affordable and fair prices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":621885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Paint

","en":"Nely, 45, lives in the southwest of the city with her spouse and two children who are 14 and 16 years old.  She sells assorted merchandise, an activity she started in order to generate income to help meet household expenses, especially those related to the education of her children.  Her dream is to have a store where she can display her wares because she currently works part time at a school and most of her customers are the teachers, parents and students to whom she sells merchandise on credit and sells puddings and sandwiches for cash.  They pay cash for their purchases and sometimes on credit too because she manages a specialized catalogue through which she displays products like cosmetics, perfume, clothes and often footwear but she also sells other things that she buys directly from other suppliers and is able to fill customer orders for items not included in the catalogue.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Nely works diligently maintaining a 25% profit margin on sales and a 6 day accounts receivable turnover rate, financial indicators from which we can project potential growth and a successful investment of the Kiva loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy clothes, cosmetics and perfume taking advantage of the approaching day of love and friendship when sales increase because her customers want to give signs of affection to their loved ones, family members and friends through gifts purchased from

Con los ingresos obtenidos ella  le brinda lo necesario a su hija, y paga el alquiler de la casa donde viven.\n\nDebido a que la se\u00f1ora Ada esta viendo que su negocio le esta siendo rentable, ella solicita a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayudar\u00e1 a comprar mayor cantidad de insumos. De esta manera ella podr\u00e1 elaborar m\u00e1s hamacas, ya que las vende muy r\u00e1pido.\n\nDe los ingresos que obtenga de la venta de sus hamacas la se\u00f1ora Ada planea ahorrar para darle a su hija la oportunidad de estudiar, ya que ella no la tuvo. En un futuro la se\u00f1ora Ada tambi\u00e9n desea adquirir una casa propia donde pueda vivir junto a su peque\u00f1a hija.\n","en":"Ada, 29, is a single mother living with her 7-year-old daughter.  She is a very hardworking woman who has been making hammocks for the last 7 years.  Her parents taught her this skill so that she\u2019d have a source of income.\r\n\r\nAda must travel every two weeks to buy the necessary supplies to make her hammocks.  She does this in the company of her little daughter.  The trip takes about half an hour by bus.  Once she makes the hammocks she goes out on foot to sell them door to door in neighboring communities.  Income earned allows her to provide what\u2019s needed for her daughter and to pay the rent on her house.\r\n\r\nBecause Ada has been noticing that her business is becoming profitable, she asks Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan that will help her buy larger amounts of supplies so that she can make more hammocks since she sells them very quickly.\r\n\r\nAda plans to save part of the income obtained from the hammock sales to provide her daughter with an opportunity to go to school, since she herself never had that opportunity.  In future, Ada also wants to acquire a house of her own to live in with her little girl.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":876501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

Fidaa' runs a grocery store but does not have enough money to increase the variety of items she sells.\r\n\r\nFidaa\u2019 is requesting a loan from FATEN to purchase grocery items to increase her competitiveness and profit. This will improve her family\u2019s living conditions. She will repay her loan on a monthly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Known for its sandy beaches, Pre-Incan ruins, and production of the beloved national liquor, Pisco (a type of grape brandy), Mila has long been a tourist destination for wealthy Peruvians.  Mila is a warm and quiet city that has a large Afro-Peruvian population.  The remains of an indigenous trail are located here and the influence of the Spanish empire is evident. The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged during the earthquakes in 2001 and 2007 but bore nature\u2019s beatings as it has for much of its history.  As is well known, Per\u00fa is characterized by the most delicious meals in the world and one of Iveth\u2019s favorite dishes is milanesa (a typical meat dish dipped in egg and bread crumbs).\r\n\r\nIveth studied until the fifth year in high school but would very much like to study Graphic Design.  Iveth is a single mother and has a little boy who is only one year old.  She is very tenacious and works about ten hours a day selling fruit.   When she was a little girl, Iveth helped her mother sell fruit and learned what it means to earn bread from the sweat of the brow.  This experience encouraged her to have her own business and she has well learned how to manage it in the same way.  On any given day, she may have as many as 70 customers and this allows her to earn approximately S\/. 400 daily.   On a good day she may earn S\/. 650, which helps her with some of the extra household expenses, especially the expenses for her one year old baby.  She believes that the success of her business is due to the variety and quality of the products she offers.\r\n\r\nToday, she is very grateful for the Kiva loans because thanks to the support offered, she has been able to buy scaffolding and materials for her business.  This improvement will help her to increase her business and obtain better income in order to improve the quality of life for her family. In addition, she will be able to have a sales stand in her home in a few months where she will offer fruits and later sell wholesale soft drinks.   She will use the loan to continue investing in her business and it will help her in the future to fulfill her great dream: to have a wholesale soft drink business.  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":963066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase scaffolding and materials.

The group leaders in this group represent a total of 68 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of KES 5,349 (shillings) to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, Manasse is pictured on the right of the group, with his hand raised.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nManasse is married and he has eight children. He is 68 years old and is known as friendly, hard-working, reliable, trustworthy, and an experienced farmer. He is active in his community, in groups such as the men's group, savings group, prayer group, and burial committee. Manasse has been a farmer for 30 years. He described his harvest as good last year, but believes he can have an even better one this year, by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nManasse joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader. He joined One Acre Fund, so that he could get the best seed prices, get new farming methods, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough money to feed his family and send his children to school. \n\nBecause he likes being a leader and is an active community member who wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers, Manasse has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund, as a group leader and Kiva representative. Working with One Acre Fund has improved Manasse's life because he has more profits from harvest, has more farm training, has more farm group support, and was able to save money and feed the family.  \n\nIn the future, Manasse hopes that his profits from 2014 can be used to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, buy a cow, buy a goat, and invest in a business.  \n\nManasse's Group needs a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. \n\nOne Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\n\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and

But with courage and determination, Mr. AGBA managed to overcome difficulties and provide for his family\u2019s needs. With the increasing use of motorbikes by the population of Togo, mainly in the capital city, the demand for engine oil is on the rise, and Mr AGBA fails to meet the needs of engine oil. He therefore wants to increase the volume of his stock of engine oil so that he can meet his customers\u2019 needs, and have a source of income for the welfare of his family.\r\n\r\nThe financing of $ 650 he requested will help him keep his stock of engine oil, constantly renewed.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur AGBA K. est n\u00e9 en 1970 \u00e0 Gati dans la pr\u00e9fecture du Zio.

Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur. She is 63 years old. Rosefely is widowed and has 1 child. To make a living, Rosefely owns and operates a sari-sari  (general) store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap,  toothpaste etc., in the local community. Rosefely has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosefely joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosefely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Rosefely is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Rosefely from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":369091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

She wants to buy a cellular phone plan and a photocopier for her business.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo in the amount of 800,000 COP.  Aracely started her business three years ago in order to generate an income.  She borrowed 300,000 COP from a friend at an interest rate of 15% so that she could start selling cell phone minutes and renting phone booths.  With this money, she bought her first two cell phone plans, a table, and a chair to begin her operation.  She also bought candy to take advantage of potential sales since many people pass by her location.  \r\n<p>\r\nAracely has been a member of Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo for nine months.  From that moment, her life changed for the better because she was able to relieve herself of high interest loans and channel more of her money into improving her income.  She dreams of having a prosperous business and adding other services such as Internet and photocopying.  Aracely continues to look for other ways to generate revenue so that she can move her one-month-old son forward and provide him a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nBeing a young woman, Aracely appears to not have any problems.  She is eager to continue working and looking for opportunities to help her become successful over time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

They have one child who is 10 years old. \r\n\r\nDivina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Divina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her child. \r\n\r\nDivina R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She\u2019s separated from her husband but lives with her four children who are 13, 11, 9 and 7 years old in a house that\u2019s her property.  Diana sells all sorts of clothes for both men and women.  To do so, she travels constantly to the city of Lima to buy clothes at lower prices.  Her client portfolio consists of acquaintances, school teachers, friends and referred customers; she sells on credit or for cash.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s been in this line of work for six years and in this time she\u2019s become well-known and has won over the preference of her regular customers.  What she likes about her work is having income to meet household expenses and be able to educate her children because since she\u2019s alone she can only count on the allowance her ex-husband provides.  She considers her business to be profitable because it produces regular profits and she has a regular customer base which leads to constant turnover of stock inventory which is why she wants to open a clothing store at home.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #3.  She is very grateful for the loan she got to continue forward with her business so she commits to be punctual with her installment payments.  She will use the entire amount requested to buy clothes in various styles and for all genders and looking for the best prices so that her profits will be higher.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":920496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy all sorts of clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T18:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":153.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622039},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":159.36,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:42Z","rounded_local_amount":161.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836132},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":158.75,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":161.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245896},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":171.22,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:43Z","rounded_local_amount":173.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385925},{"amount":66.6,"local_amount":177.6,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":180.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099011},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":184.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713159}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T20:00:56Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":363223,"name":"Jeruk Manis 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lince is a mother of two.

Her business is to sell different new cloths to her customers. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, seven days per week. Sifa currently earns about 350 USD from her business.

Sifa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<strong>About the field partner:<\/strong>.\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and payback microfinance facility.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Dadeth has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Dadeth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Dadeth successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Dadeth is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Dadeth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to provide tuition for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

 Sra. Gissela has been part of this bank for two cycles, and thanks to this big help that the Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir has offered her, she has been able to continue her business of selling clothing. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nGissela is married, and with hardly 17 years of age, she is expecting her second son.  She tells us that she made a commitment at 16 years of age that even without terminating her studies, she sells informal clothing for women, men, and children.  She visits her neighbors door to door, and makes it easy for them to pay.  With her job, she contributes to the household expenses and is a big help for her husband.  The grandmother of the children is in charge of taking care of the children while she goes out to make her sales.  Before getting pregnant with her second child, she traveled to Otavalo and Guayaquil to buy her merchandise wholesale.  Due to her pregnant state, her aunt is who travels to make the purchases in the province in order to supply her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan that Gissela is requesting, she will stock her business for the Christmas and end of year season, where she has more requests from her customers.  She will buy pants, blouses, shirts, and more clothing for women, men, and children.  Gissela's dream is to have her own house and clothing store, and for this will begin saving little by little.  She is sure that someday she will achieve it.  She is a young women and what she has more than anything are desires to work, and even more with the arrival of her second son in the next few days.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":436686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy pants, blouses, shirts, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Gisella Lisbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":330,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680053},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":29.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680054},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074569},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:40Z","rounded_local_amount":29.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074570},{"amount":59.58,"local_amount":56.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":59.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910562},{"amount":27.92,"local_amount":26.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":27.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946166},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":29.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946167},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674538},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674539}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T03:02:20Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":161807,"name":"Timothy Ngigi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Timothy is 40 years old and married with five children.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flordeliz has been working hard and incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children's education. Flordeliz G. is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. \"Dungganon\" is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities they could not have imagined.

She is 40 years old and married. To make a living, Esmerna owns & operates a fishing business. The main source of income for the business comes from selling fresh fish in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Esmerna joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC, and is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This will be Esmerna\u2019s third loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher-folk and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She began selling at open-air markets in working-class neighborhoods two and a half years ago. \r\n<p>\r\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy for Estrella to work to support her child on her own, but her love as a mother and her energy have helped her go out day after day to work hard for her child\u2019s well-being. She is now in need of a loan of $475 to acquire merchandise for the continued growth of her business. Estrella and her daughter sincerely appreciate your help and kindness. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Leo Duran, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEstrella Maribel tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad,  es originaria de M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n, ella no est\u00e1 casada, pero tiene un hijo de 6 a\u00f1os que depende de ella.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

He is 43 years old. Hilario is married and has school-aged children. To make a living, Hilario owns and operates a business running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Hilario has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.(Hilario was out of town during the picture taking, so we let his wife represent him, being a partner in their business.)\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Hilario joined HSPFI to have access to financial services. As to their previous loan, Helario and his wife are both happy and thankful for all the Kiva lenders who provide financial support. With this support, their business is growing and making more progress than before. They are hopeful that lenders may continue to finance their business activities. They have just ended their previous loan amounting to PHP 20,000. Hilario is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Hilario from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family, educational expenses of the children and savings for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":358031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Milagrosa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Milagrosa from GDMPC.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

After he harvests his crops he takes them to the town of Pichanaki to sell as this is where he receives the best prices for them.\r\n\r\nWhat Darwin most enjoys about his work is cultivating his land.  He has been in this business for 5 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his products since the route is very rugged.  Over time, he hopes to buy more land in order to increase the quantity of crops that he produces.\r\n\r\nThis is Darwin's fourth loan with MFP.  He was very punctual in paying back his previous loans and he hopes to continue being punctual.  Darwin is a very well-liked member of his community bank because his happiness is contagious.

For almost eight years, she has been working at the Vohuri cafeteria.  The cafeteria is located in the central market and brings in a decent income.  Currently, Nurbibi plans to obtain a loan in order to purchase new inventory.  This will help her improve the quality of service and attract new clients.

She is 45 years old. Celea is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Celea owns & operates a business making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling rice products in the local community. Celea has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Celea joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Celea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. Celea is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Celea from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For the past 4 years she has provided mototaxi transportation services. Her husband is the driver and he goes to various parts of the city.  She began with an initial loan from Manuela Ramos Movement and little by little saved up enough to buy replacement parts to improve the service offered to area residents.  With this 1500 sol loan she will buy parts and lubricants like brake pads, spark plugs, etc. to offer better service.  Ludith is happy to belong to a group of women who have helped her to know her rights and, together, have seen that they are respected.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Mercy owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Mercy has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Mercy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercy  successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. Mercy is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be Mercy's ninth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is positive that her businesses will grow since she already has regular customers buying her pigs after four months and solid clients for her E-loading business at home.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a pig farm someday and to provide satisfactory E-loading to her customers. She hopes to have successful businesses that can provide her with a good life and enable her to move beyond the poverty line. She is grateful to ASHI for offering her happiness in life and group support in achieving her goals.\r\n\r\nCarmelita\u2019s long term goals are to build sustainable businesses and to fund her three children\u2019s college education.

She is 41 years of age, is married, and is blessed with two children of whom one is now a college student and the other is still an infant.\n\nAlfonsa is presently engaged in selling RTW (Ready-To-Wear clothes) from GTY, as well as selling AVON Products and running a sari-sari (variety) store. She\u2019s been engaged in selling GTY and AVON products for five years already and earns approximately Php 1,300 a month. Her husband also gives her regular support from his income as a mango sprayer.\n\nJust this year, Alfonsa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As a newly-recognized member of PMPC under its Regular Loan Program, she requesting a loan of Php 10,000 as her first loan, to be used as additional capital for her business selling RTW and AVON products.\n\nAlfonsa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her general living conditions, especially in meeting her basic needs, saving for the future, loan repayments, her children\u2019s education, insurances, and possible business expansions.\n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Alma is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Alma from ASKI.

He has been a farmer for the past 4 years, which he began with the goal of supporting his household and above all to satisfy the needs of his children. For Sayali, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do. Within it, vegetable production is what he likes most, as it is easier to cultivate these plants and the product is profitable in season, which is annually. But the earnings are greater and beneficial for every farmer, especially when buyers purchase the production in great quantities and the expense of transporting the products is avoided as the buyers come to harvest and take it away themselves. Now Sayali wishes to borrow money which he wants to invest in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. Sayali is sincerely grateful to all of you.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in Siana, a village in the District of Kolondi\u00e8ba (third largest administrative region in the Republic of Mali). As he did not have the chance to attend school, Moussa became interested at a young age in activities that generate profits, especially repairing bicycles and motorbikes. He owns a store on the side of the road that passes through Siana and sells spare parts for bicycles and motorbikes, new and secondhand bicycles, and offers to repair other bicycles. In order to increase his revenue he became a meme of the lending group Soro Yiriwaso and his asking for his first individual loan. He plans to use the loan to purchase a large number of spare parts from wholesalers in Bamako (capital city of Mali). He re-sells the individual parts for cash as well as for credit to a diverse clientele. He hopes to gain monthly profits of 30,000 FCFA [approximately 61 USD] which will be used to purchase animals and pay the school and health fees for his children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":691756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

Through the years her business has improved with the acquisition of better tools for use in her salon and also with increased sales of her cosmetics. <p>\r\nOne need that is currently facing Ms. Berrios is that due to her lower income level, she believes it urgent to invest in the purchase of cosmetics and in remodeling her shop since the sector in which she is located is very competitive and the other salons are in better conditions.  For this reason Mar\u00eda sincerely requests to be granted a loan that she can invest in improving her salon and thereby continue to support her young daughter.\r\n<p>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, KIVA volunteer <p>\r\nMar\u00eda Dora Berrios es una dama soltera y con una peque\u00f1a hija que tiene su propio negocio de venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y un peque\u00f1o sal\u00f3n de belleza donde atiende al publico en general.

Mel\u00e9ndez lives in the small town of Armenia in the province of Sonsonate.  For five years now, Santos has been running a small business selling sandals and CDs.  He lives with his wife and four children, all of them school aged.  His large family gives him various costs and economic complications, but at the same time, it's family that gives him inspiration and a desire to advance.  The journey hasn't been easy; in the beginning Santos lacked work capital and no banking institution trusted him nor loaned him money. This forced him to borrow money from individual lenders that sometimes charged him interest costs much higher than that of the loan itself.  With courage and faith in himself Santos never stopped believing in his dream.  Santos P. dreams about opening a store selling milk products and clothing, which will guarantee a decent education for his children.  For now, Santos is looking to expand his business.  This is the reason why he is requesting a loan to buy more sandals and CDs, which will help his small shop to grow and develop.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSantos P.

Junto a \u00e9l, viven su esposa y cuatro hijos, todos peque\u00f1os y todos estudiantes en la escuela. Su amplia familia le provoca m\u00faltiples gastos y complicaciones econ\u00f3micas, pero a la vez, es la misma familia, quien se vuelve su inspiraci\u00f3n y fuerzas de avanzar. El camino no ha sido f\u00e1cil, pues en sus inicios, Santos carec\u00eda de capital de trabajo, y ninguna instituci\u00f3n bancaria confiaba en el, ni le prestaba dinero. Esto lo forz\u00f3 a prestar dinero a prestamistas individuales, que le cobraban tasas de intereses a veces m\u00e1s altas que el pr\u00e9stamo mismo. Con valor y fe en s\u00ed mismo, Santos nunca dejo de creer en su visi\u00f3n.

She has 400 broiler chickens that she raises.  People come to her home and buy these chickens to take to the market to sell.    Ruth says that the market for broiler chickens is very large so it is able to support the large number of people who do it. Ruth buys her chickens from Uga-chick.  Uga-chick is a place where many Ugandan poultry farmers buy day-old chickens.  Although this practice does not differentiate her from other poultry farmers, she tries to be competitive in the market by spending extra money on food supplements.  The important thing with broiler chickens is that they are heavy.  If you just feed the chickens a lot of food, they will grow heavy, but not as heavy as if you spend a little extra for supplements.    Ruth has four older children who stay around her home.  She says that although they are now old (32, 30, 28, and 25), they still depend on her.  She also has 3 small children that she cares for.  Two of these children are from her late brother and one of them is a grandchild.  These children all need their daily needs met as well as school fees.    Ruth is requesting a loan of 250,000 USH.  This will allow her to buy the critical supplements as well as four bags of feed.

Precilla is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Precilla from HSPFI.
