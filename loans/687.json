This city is a mountainous region where one of the principal industries is tourism. And in one of the most rural areas, Angel and this group of 15 members are taking loans for their businesses, this group is named Desarrollo para el Progreso 1, 2 & 3 (Development to progress).\n\nAngel requires a loan to buy a coconut tree to sell coconuts all over the city and on different beaches. This is his second loan with Esperanza International, and he decided to take out a loan with us because he feels comfortable with the payments and especially because these loans are for businesses. He is very excited to belong to this group of neighbors doing business for the improvement of their families and the community. He will take a step toward having one of his dreams come true \u2014 having his own business \u2014 and he knows that by working hard, he will improve his business and be able to save and provide any help his children require.\n\nAngel says that his favorite thing is to work, especially in the land, by planting different trees and seeding. He hopes that the profit from his business will be enough to buy his own vehicle and to have a business without debts.

was born in 1968; she is married to Mr. Phillip  and is the mother of seven children all above the age of 15. They are living at Elemighong, a quarter in Belo Sub Division, North West Region of Cameroon.\n\nBelta has faced major challenges in her life especially sickness and poverty. The most difficult have been the problem of raising capital for her business and paying for her children\u2019s education.  She plans to invest this loan in selling Irish potatoes and rearing goats. She will be able to raise a lot of profit from the business because it is highly demanded in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time and so she has experience as far as the business is concerned, and she has successfully borrowed and repaid a loan one time already from GHAPE. This loan was invested in buying and selling Irish potatoes. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford Irish potatoes at a very low cost.\n\nBelta will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's tuition fees, and save some for a rainy day. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back the loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Se\u00f1ora Maria is characterized by being kind, dedicated, and, above all, hard-working. Her work is making and selling delicious tortillas. Every morning she gets up in the early hours of the morning to prepare all the ingredients for the tortillas, so that she will have them ready when the customers ask for them. In spite of her advanced age, she does not give up. For her, it is very important to maintain her business, since in this way she contributes to the household finances, which often are not sufficient to cover all the necessities. She is very enterprising. She is always thinking of ways to make her business grow. Finally, she thought a lot about the possibility of getting a loan to invest in her tortilla shop, with the goal of having a better supply for her customers so that it would allow her to attract more customers. All this brought her to take the decision to apply for a loan at INTEGRAL to invest in the purchase of the ingredients (corn, water, lime, propane gas, etc) necessary to continue producing and offering the delicious tortillas. She does all this with the goal of improving her levels of sales and income in such a way that her quality of life and that of her family will

has been farming for 25 years and raising cattle for 30. He owns a small plot of land in Santa Lucia, Ecuador, where he cultivates rice and also has some livestock. Oswaldo and his wife Mersy have 2 children, ages 10 and 11. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to buy fertilizer for his rice, a resource he is particularly in need of. Although Oswaldo runs his farm well, he does not have a formal education and has very limited reading and writing skills. He believes his farm will continue to generate profits, especially with this loan, and he will be able to provide his children with the education he did not have the privilege of receiving himself. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Oswaldo is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials for rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T01:06:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T23:35:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:03:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15385},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:20:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21958},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:22:34Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29288},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-07T23:43:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40095},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:16:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65652},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:44:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66068}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T23:35:22Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:44:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10514,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa has a business selling fruits, such as apples, grapes, passion fruit, oranges, tree tomatoes, and others.

Its leader, Mrs. Chi T., 39, is a widowed mother who has three children. All three of them are single and attend school. She usually sells fresh fish that she buys in bulk from a wholesale supplier and then retails them for a profit in the local market.

She lives in a small rural community in Costa Rica called Cuatro de Bocas de Upala, located in the province of Alajuela.  There, they have business activities such as storekeeping, dual purpose cattle farming (meat and dairy), and agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth has been involved in dual purpose cattle farming for several years now.  She is able to sell her products to neighbors in her community, who are very satisfied with the quality of the products that she offers.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth thinks that thanks to the progress of this project, she and her family have improved, little by little, their quality of life and that she has been able to be a participant in the development of the community.  She also comments that since the beginning of the business, her self-esteem has increased greatly and now she feels very capable.\r\n<p>\r\nRight now, Ruth would like a loan of 650,000 CRC to purchase 6 male calves so that she can increase her production.  She knows that having more cows is a bigger sacrifice and will require more work.  However, her desire to have a successful small business and help her family get ahead and improve their living conditions motivates her to work with great care and dedication.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Bansuperafe, which consists of only women.  It specializes in supporting women who are not professionals or the head of household.  It is one of EDESA\u2019s 100 partner organizations in Costa Rica.  This will be Ruth\u2019s fourth loan and with it, she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level, in addition to actively participating in the loan organization in her community.<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This group of women live in the rural community of Corredores, Puntarenas, in the southern part of Costa Rica, located near the Panamanian border. The group members are involved in various productive economic activities including taxi driving, food sales, running a restaurant, natural medicine sales, sewing and running a corner store. The women plan to use this loan to make general investments towards the expansion of their businesses.\r\n\r\nMargarita E. A. is a 44-year-old single mother of four.

She wants her family to be prosperous and hopes to one day own a little house. Her main obstacles are financial: the high costs of living and of products coupled with a lull in the number of people eating out (as opposed to cooking at home) has made business a challenge for Erica. Nevertheless, she remains optimistic, stating: \u00a8with strength and a positive attitude, we will overcome these obstacles.\u00a8 With respect to group dynamics, she observes that the members are part of a good group; they understand each other, help each other and are very sociable.\r\n\r\nJessica N.

The cosmetics she sells from a catalogue by visiting potential clients in her community and offering them various items. Jessica will use this loan to purchase medicinal and cosmetic products to sell in her community. Some of her most popular items are natural products which facilitate weight loss.\r\n\r\nJessica\u00b4s aspires to finish her degree in Business Administration.

The loan consultant that has been working with her over the years describes her as a professional, goal oriented, hardworking woman who has displayed exemplary client behavior regarding punctual repayments in the past.\r\n\r\nOlga has a nurse\u2019s license and a master\u2019s degree. Years ago, she decided to put her nursing career on hold and opened a store in order to have more time to spend with her daughter. Olga\u2019s business is based in Tierra Blanca where she sells women\u2019s undergarments, cosmetics and jewelry. Olga works in the afternoons and has the mornings to attend to her other responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Olga has used her loans to invest in her business, to purchase clothing, and to improve her services to her clients. However, the current loan will be used to pay her debt to the Professional Nurses Association so that she can retain the right to work as a nurse in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nOlga\u2019s goals are to increase her client base, make more sales, and expand her business. She is dedicated to working hard, whether as a nurse or at her business, in order to ensure a quality standard of living for her children. An obstacle Olga faces is a recent decrease in sales levels. She says she needs to seek out new clients. Also, with the baby coming, life is sure to become a lot more exciting and challenging.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":520975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To pay membership fees of the Professional Nurses Association","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Tierra Blanca, Cartago","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":17769.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18066.15},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18367.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18673.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18984.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":19301},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":19622.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":19949.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20282.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20620.26},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20963.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":21313.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":21668.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22029.7},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":22387.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.24},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.18},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.73},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.58,"local_amount":17770,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":18100.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678115},{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":21650.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":22053.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712587},{"amount":168.59,"local_amount":91960.39,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":93670.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763256},{"amount":78.1,"local_amount":42601.44,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:32Z","rounded_local_amount":43393.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850742},{"amount":40.03,"local_amount":21834.71,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":22240.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172258680},{"amount":40.7,"local_amount":22198.62,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":22611.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551329},{"amount":83.44,"local_amount":45513.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46359.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148748},{"amount":66.87,"local_amount":36471.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":37149.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970499}],"funded_date":"2010-04-12T23:06:49Z","paid_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":195734,"name":"Srey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srey C. is 53 years old and is a villager who lives in Kandal Kaoh Touch village in Kandal province.

Her husband is a casual laborer and they have three children aged between 9 and 13 whom they hope to educate to the university level. \r\n\r\nHer business is located in Mwingi but served by the Thika Branch. Thika is the region in Kenya known for the production of pineapples. She has been selling goats to the local people for the last 10 years. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is getting food for the goats during the dry season and actually, some goats die during this period.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nJoy is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.

He lives with Luisa, 32, and their 4 children, who are the joy of their home.  They live in their own home in the community of Pataccocha, an annex of the Santa Rosa district.  Marcial is a resourceful man who puts a lot of care into the work that he does.  He works in agriculture, and has 4 hectares of land where he cultivates cocoa, barbasco (a plant used to make a natural temporary poison used in fishing), and coca leaves.  He has been doing this kind of work for 10 years, and so now is very knowledgeable about farming.  During the harvest season, he hires worker to help him with the harvest.  His most profitable products are the coffee beans and the coca leaves, because the wholesale firms that buy the products pay him well for each kilogram.  The problem with his work is that he must fight against the insects that damage the fruits of his plants.  The loan requested is to acquire more cocoa seedlings to plant, so that he can get the most fruit out of his plants in less time.  But now, his priority is to buy new land so that he can expand his cultivations and increase his production.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he knows that he has the responsibility to make all of his payments on time and he is ready to do this.  He feels very grateful to the institution for granting him the loan that he requested.  With the 3,000 Peruvian soles requested he will buy cocoa seedlings to plant, so that he can get the most fruit from his plants in less time.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":731227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T18:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcial ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":199.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":217.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":218.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":226.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":237.15},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":243.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":253.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":261.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":271.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":280.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":290.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":299.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.95},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3044.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196377}],"funded_date":"2011-03-23T10:30:44Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":285881,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolando C., age 34, earns a living by offering tricycle transportation services.

only having an elementary education, Walter A. has a successful farm. He cultivates the lands he grew up on with his parents. He has taken the lead in the farm due to his father's old age. He has been doing well and is seeking investment capital in order to rent machinery to collect his crops and sell them on his own, avoiding having to deal with a middle man. He is single and does not have children, but he is a very hard worker and aspires to have a family in the future. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>

It is difficult to conceive the idea that women that have been so marginalized from the social, economic, and political system of the country have access to a service as modern as credit.  In their town they heard about a lady called America that works on a project in which they give fast loans with dependable and low interest.  That \"lady\" is America Chiyal, a loan agent that works for Friendship Bridge.  The women that make up the group joined to form the communal bank and once they had formed said unit they contacted America.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Parromeras contacted the institution because they need a loan to enlarge the amount of capital for their business.  Half of the group is going to invest their loan in the breeding and sale of chickens.  Some are going to buy chickens already grown to feed for some weeks and then sell.  Others are going to buy the chickens already grown to cut up and sell in the market, while others are going to buy the chickens already cut up and plucked to sell in the market.  Juana Martinez says that she not only plans to invest her loan in the breeding of chickens, but she also plans to buy piglets to grow fat and then sell in the market, and finally she also embroiders typical blouses.  One is surprised by the versatility of many of these women.  \r\n\r\n<P>The other half of the group is divided into 3 parts.  Three women sell vegetables in the market.  They will invest their loan in the purchase of carrots, huisquil (a type of squash), cabbage, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and avocado, among other vegetables.  Two women work with a foot loom to make short and long traditional skirts.   Usually, only men work in the looms owing to the force required to work the loom.  The last group works embroidering traditional blouses of their towns.  \r\n\r\n<P>The dream of the women of Parromero is to grow their business so that they do not have to depend on debt to have a profitable business and so that they can generate sufficient income to invest in their business and to cover the needs of their families.  Inside this communal bank there are many women with the drive of Juana Martinez, nevertheless many of these women battle alone.  That is why, if we give them a hand, they are going to feel that they are not alone in their fight against poverty.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>San Jose Chacaya es una comunidad retirada en el altiplano de Guatemala.

Esa \u201csenora\u201d es America Chiyal, una agente de cr\u00e9dito que trabaja para Friendship Bridge. Las mujeres que integran el grupo se juntaron para formar el banco comunal y una vez conformado dicha unidad contactaron a America. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Parromeras contactaron la instituci\u00f3n porque necesitan un cr\u00e9dito para aumentar el tama\u00f1o del capital de su negocio.

Otras van a comprar los pollos ya crecidos para destazarlos y venderlos en el mercado, mientras que otras van a comprar los pollos ya destazados y desplumados para venderlos en el mercado. Juana Martinez dice que ella no solo invierte su cr\u00e9dito en la crianza de pollos, sino que ella tambi\u00e9n a comprado sus cerditos para engordarlos y luego venderlos en el mercado, finalmente ella tambi\u00e9n borda blusas t\u00edpicas. Uno se sorprende de la versatilidad de muchas de estas mujeres. \r\n\r\n<P>La otra mitad del grupo se divide en tres mujeres que venden verduras en el mercado y que invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de zanahoria, huisquil, repollo, cebollas, tomates, lechuga, aguacate, entre otras verduras. Luego, dos mujeres trabajan en telar de pies. Ellas elaboran cortes, faldas largas tradicionales. Usualmente, solo los hombres trabajan en los telares debido a la fuerza requerida para emplear el telar. Mientras que el resto trabaja bordando blusas tradicionales de sus pueblos. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de las mujeres Parromero es el de agrandar su negocio para que as\u00ed no tengan que depender de una deuda para tener un negocio rentable y para que puedan generar las suficientes utilidades para que puedan invertir en su negocio y cubrir las necesidades de sus familias. Dentro de este banco comunal hay muchas mujeres con el empuje de Juana Martinez, sin embargo muchas de estas mujeres se encuentran batallando solas, es por eso que si nosotros les demos un empuje,

Gaspar R\u00edos Fern\u00e1ndez is married to Mercedes Morinigo and the father of 3 children ages 12, 10, and 6, respectively.  This client currently dedicates himself to the activation and sale of cell phone chips.  He was previously on the staff of the Ministry of Defense.  He resigned in 1998 after 10 years of service because his salary did not permit him to support his wife and his then two children, nor much less allow him to expect a life even halfway respectable.  This is how, that same year, he joined the Sales Department of a personal electronics enterprise and then later started selling pre-paid lines.  Since then, he has worked buying electronic chips to sell himself.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo states that he had never been able to expand his business until his loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, because he lacked the necessary documents required by other financial entities and banks in order to obtain a loan through them.  Once finally able to access credit, he obtained a site for his business in the city of Lambar\u00e9.  His store is stocked with cell phone accessories as well as activation lines, and he also sells pre-paid lines.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for helping him with his first

The live in their own wooden house in the town of Quimbiri, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle. Dina provides for herself since she was 21: she dreamed of having her own shop, but as fate had it, she has dedicated herself to the production and sales of artisanal wood bricks instead. Since she started, this activity has been very profitable, and it has given her many economical satisfactions. She currently sells her bricks in the town of Pichari, which experiences a constant population and economic growth; she has potential buyers there, thanks to the quality of the product she offers and the delivery times she guarantees to her customers. She generally works together with her partner, and they are a good working team, but sometimes she needs more people, and she hires workers to carry out the production more quickly.

Rita expresses her thanks to AFODENIC because it is now possible for her to make these changes and improvements.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":587059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials needed to replace the wiring system in her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.32,"local_amount":1742.52,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1747.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330903},{"amount":78.5,"local_amount":1682.12,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1686.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182466059},{"amount":77.55,"local_amount":1661.85,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1666.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098188},{"amount":79.47,"local_amount":1702.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348765},{"amount":77.6,"local_amount":1662.93,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1667.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766439},{"amount":78.55,"local_amount":1683.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209486},{"amount":78.3,"local_amount":1677.77,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078298},{"amount":78.08,"local_amount":1673.21,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1677.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147366},{"amount":70.63,"local_amount":1513.44,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216432919}],"funded_date":"2010-09-06T02:53:50Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:26:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":228525,"name":"Johana Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el Banco Comunal San Eduardo que se re\u00fanen cada  quince d\u00edas en la calle del mismo nombre en la ciudad de Portoviejo cerca de un hermoso parque llamado \u201cEl Mamey \u201c.\n\nEncontramos a la se\u00f1ora Johana, est\u00e1 casada y tiene dos ni\u00f1as una de ocho y otra hermosa bebita de un mes que son la luz de su vida comenta.

Ibrogim decided to launch this business 15 years ago because he has always loved working with technical systems. He is now seeking a loan of 7500 Somoni to purchase necessary materials and spare parts. He believes his business policy, which allows for deferred payments, will be an attraction for his customers and will help him stand out among his competitors. Ibrogim has repaid his previous two loans from IMON International, both of which contributed to the growth of his business. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Some people treat it with respect as a sign of wisdom and greatness. Some fear it, and try to face it as late as possible. And some just accept it as inevitable human nature and deal with it easily. Our next heroine thinks that aging is not an excuse for not following dreams and being successful.\r\n \r\nMarjan D., 63, born in the small town of Toktogul, started her business breeding livestock 25 years ago. Growing up in the village, this was the only thing she spent her whole time on and was good at. The art of taking good care of livestock is carefully taught from one generation to the next. Marjan is married and is fortunate to have five children. Her husband has worked as a surgeon his entire life. The children are already grown and have their own families. Marjan used only 15,000 KGS for her business start-up and had to sacrifice her husband\u2019s salary. She and her husband understood that it was very risky to invest the last savings in business start-up, but an endless hope and belief drove them forward. Despite her age, Marjan is a very ambitious woman. She gathered a group of four businessmen who are very experienced in breeding livestock before she applied for a loan. At this time Marjan needs 20,000 KGS, which she will use to purchase one more head of cattle. Her dream is to purchase land in the capital Bishkek.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She has operated a grocery in her neighborhood for the past 15 years, selling fruits and vegetables and other products.  Florence first started the grocery because there weren\u2019t any in her neighborhood.  She started with just a few items, such as tomatoes and bananas, and gradually expanded her business to include more items.  \r\n<p>\r\nTwice a week, Florence goes off early in the morning to the Owino Market, a large outdoor market near downtown Kampala, and buys about 150,000 (Ugandan shillings) or roughly $90 (US dollars) worth of produce.  She transports the goods back to her grocery stall via motorcycle taxi (boda boda) or minibus taxi (matatu). \r\n<p>\r\nBeing the first grocery to open in her neighborhood guaranteed Florence would have many customers, although there are now other groceries nearby.  Florence's grocery is open seven days a week from 8:00 AM in the morning until 9:00 PM at night, except on Sunday when she opens at 9:00 AM after attending mass.  She is helped by her sister who also works at the grocery. \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence uses the profits from her business to pay school fees for her children.  Profits are getting smaller as food prices go up. Florence has struggled to pay loans back in the face of unexpected expenses, but as she has been a member of MCDT for the last three years, she and her group have been able to repay approximately nine loans.  Florence says that the loans make her life better, helping her to overcome challenges, in particular the school fees.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorence currently lives in a house with three rooms, but she would like to build a larger house with five rooms. Her ultimate goal with a larger loan and sufficient savings is to build a bigger house for her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor now, with this new loan, Florence would like to buy a refrigerator.  This will help her business because she will be able to sell cold drinks in addition to the produce she sells."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":178753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a refrigerator to sell cold drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-07-15T15:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-02T00:18:40Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":155,"local_amount":251351.35,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":253890,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":314496},{"amount":155,"local_amount":251351.35,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-03T07:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":253890,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345948},{"amount":152.5,"local_amount":247297.3,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-20T08:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":249795,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334439},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":252525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955632},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:15Z","rounded_local_amount":252525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14876002},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":252525,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20421604}],"funded_date":"2008-07-19T00:18:40Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:58:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":59703,"name":"Marina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marina is married.

He has two adult children who live independently, each with their own work.  One of his children lives close to him, while the others live in Trinidad, where they also help Genaro by bringing him merchandise when they travel.  Genaro sells watches, radios, dvds and other inexpensive electric goods.  He has some competition and as a mobile vendor seeks out different markets to sell his products.  The loan he has requested is for the purpose of increasing his working capital, since he was traveling inland to bring back merchandise bought at wholesale.

Mrs. Esther Silver, who makes and sells cleaning products. She contacted an advisor during a weekly meeting that took place in the neighborhood, inquiring about how to form a committee of enterprising women. Once part of the program, she was able to group 15 women, which are now working together in their 8th cycle within the program. \r\n\r\nDuring the course of time, the group has experienced some inconveniences, as the daughter of the General Director was admitted to the hospital, and other participants were sick and bedridden. However, they responded without a single problem in repayments, and in this way the group has been able to progress, continuing with the program until now. \r\n\r\nThe average credit give per participant is 735,000 Gs, which goes to many different activities such as the sale of: food, hardware, grocery store products, clothing, lingerie, cosmetics, fruit, vegetables, cleaning products, crochet, etc. \r\n\r\nAll of them do their own activities in order to earn money, and mutually help each other achieve common objectives within the group and with the Paraguayan Foundation. They participate actively in weekly meetings and do an impeccably supportive job. \r\n\r\n1. Ma. Esther S. - Cleaning product sales \r\n2. Justina L. - Food sales \r\n3.

to Rey Largavita. She's a hardworking mother who wants to provide financial security for her two sons who, although already 25 and 26, have special needs because of their inborn disabilities. She is now 57 years old and worries how her sons will fend for themselves when she and her husband pass on. This is why Epifania and Rey are working very hard now to set aside some money to provide for their sons' future financial security. \r\n\r\nAs ambulant food vendors, they do a lot of walking. On a regular working day, Epifania and Rey wake up at dawn to go to the public market to buy the ingredients for their menu of the day. Epifania prepares and cooks all of the food they plan to sell, then Rey helps her pack the food into single-serve packets and arrange them equally in separate baskets. Once their food baskets are packed, Epifania takes her sons to her a neighbor she trusts to take care of them while they are working. That done, Epifania and Rey take their respective baskets and go on separate selling routes around the town, visiting their regular customers first. By walking, they increase their probability for a sale because people they meet on the street usually stop to buy the packed food they offer. When all the food is sold, they go home to rest and get things ready to do the same routine again the following day.\r\n\r\nIn July 2001, Epifania joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to borrow additional capital for her food vending business. With the additional capital, she was able to increase the food volume and also expand the variety of food that she and her husband sell. Her cooking has become so popular with other members of NWTF-PD that she now brings food to sell during the weekly center meetings that she attends. With the loans that provide her with much-needed working capital, her business has improved a lot. She earns a net profit of 8,000 Philippine pesos per month on the average, and it has been a great help for her family, especially in allowing her to afford the maintenance medicines that her sons need, as well as pay for all their household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 19,000 on her 15th loan cycle was fully paid within term and without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to buy a gas stove to cook food much faster, and the balance will again be used as revolving working capital to buy the daily ingredients of her products.\r\n\r\nEpifania is shown in the attached picture with her food offerings during one of the center meetings in the NWTF-PD Center house.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":397264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This will help him earn more revenue and enable him to live a more sustaining life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":539123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase mulches and hire more laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bushenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-28T11:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eldard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":103305.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767447},{"amount":45,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":103305.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662497},{"amount":45,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":103305.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689272},{"amount":90,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":206611.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296909},{"amount":45,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":103305.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467237},{"amount":45,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103305.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605396},{"amount":135,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":309917,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195910128}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T16:41:44Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T09:00:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":208056,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene L., 45, is making sure that her family has enough provisions for their daily needs.

He does this at his own booth in the big market of Sikassa, with a client base composed of all social classes, but especially itinerant merchants.

He is the leader of the cooperative of rice farmers and field workers named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with Us). His job as leader is to make sure that his fellow borrowers are on time and no one falls behind. He needs this loan in order to purchase all the necessary items to plant rice on his lands. He has been a rice farmer for over 20 years, and he is sure that the access to capital will help him and his fellow cooperative members be more productive than ever. He hopes that this is the first step in bypassing loan sharks and intermediaries who take many of the profits that he and his fellow field workers would otherwise make. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Benito is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":19431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:29:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-29T14:20:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:35:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16566},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:33:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21970},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:17:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29283},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:45:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39726},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:04:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53275},{"amount":555,"local_amount":555,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65646}],"funded_date":"2007-03-15T14:20:04Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10562,"name":"Shahin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahin N. is a native of the Aghsu region of Azerbaijan.

To ensure the longterm survival of her family and to help relieve some of the burden of her hard work, she hopes to get another loan to help increase her family's income.  Although already older in her years, as the wife of I Made Ardana, she must continue to farm pigs with as much energy as if she were newly married.  Little by little her savings grows thanks to the pigs she is able to sell.  She and her husband also save the money that her husband earns as a farm laborer on someone else's land.  Their system of saving has already helped them to purchase their own piece of land.  During her first loan from Kiva\/Dinari Ni Nyoman Dewi received 1,400,000 Rupiah which she used to purchase 3 piglets.  She was able to sell them for 3,500,000 Rupiah, netting her a profit of 1,200,000 Rupiah over 6 months, or 200,000 Rupiah\/month.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her brother and sister in-law died in 1993 during the civil war so Krubo also provides for their child. Krubo\u2019s husband is a farmer but doesn\u2019t earn enough to support the family. She lives in nearby Bokeza Town in a refugee camp because the town was burned to the ground during the war.\r\n\r\nKrubo\u2019s business is dry goods, such as food, housewares and clothing, which she imports from nearby Guinea. She sells in a temporary market stall alongside approximately 100 other vendors. She is successful because her customers like her personality and customer service. Her dream is to grow her business until she can build a permanent shop.  With the profits from her business Krubo dreams of building a permanent house to raise her family and send all her children to school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":380227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling scrap metal and other used products in the local community. Narciso has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Narciso joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Narciso has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Narciso is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Narciso from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She also sells miscellaneous goods and sunglasses, mostly for women. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be invested in sheets, sunglasses, miscellaneous goods and seasonal clothing.  She is a founding member of the village bank and is very grateful to the Espoir Foundation since she was able to start her business thanks to them.  Her dream is to have a shop with all of the services for her customers.

is a visionary young entrepreneur from Izum, Ukraine, who is on the pathway to success. She operates a bustling little store where she sells an attractive array of fruits and vegetables. Olga started her business as an open-air market vendor. With help from Nadiya Ukraine she was able to open a small storefront facility and gained a great competitive advantage by having a clean, indoor space to offer her selections. At her previous location she would typically earn around $20-$60 per day. With her new store, her income has increased to between $40 and as high as $180 per day.\r\n<p>\r\nOlga understands the value of customer service \u2013 a quality which sets her apart from many other business owners. She is attentive and polite to her customers and tries to give them each her individual attention.\r\n<p>\r\nOlga has requested a loan for two purposes.

Although living in a small hut with bamboo weaved walls, Ketut K. family seems to be peaceful and happy. Her husband work as a tenant farmer. He is very responsible towards his family. His hard work is not wasted by Kakek Budi, his children was able to finish high school. After marrying Ketut K. never stopped raising pigs though in very small numbers, only 1 or 2 each time, and even that done the traditional way by putting the pig on leash under a tree.\r\nMorning and evenings the pigs were fed with food obtained from the fields: leaves or talas roots that was cooked and sometimes mixed with rice shells during rice-harvest. After 3 months the pigs could be sold for Rp350,000 (about $38)\/each. With the loan to be obtained, Ketut K. will add another pig, and the rest to buy better foods like rice shells, concentrate or polar so that the pigs could grow faster. Also with the lengthy dry season reserve feed from the fields are getting difficult to obtain. With one additional pig and better feed, Ketut K. is convinced that she could get Rp300,000 (about $35)\/month nett, and this would add to daily family living expense, which average Rp20,000 (about $2.10) \/day.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nHidup rukun dan bersahaja merupakan idaman bagi setiap keluarga, walau dengan gubuk kecil yang berdindingkan gedek bambu keluarga Ketut K. kelihatan rukun dan sangat bahagia. Suaminya yang bekerja sebagai petani sangat bertanggung jawab terhadap keluarganya. kerja kerasnya ini juga tak di sia-siakan  oleh Kadek budi antara anak nya untuk menyelesaikan pendidikannya sampai tingkat SMA. Sejak menikah Ketut K. Tak pernah putus memelihara babi walau hanya dalam jumlah yang kecil yaitu 1 sampai 2 ekor saja, dan itupun dengan cara yg masih tradisional Babinya di ikat di bawah pohon, pagi dan sore ternaknya   diberi makanan yg di buat\/diperoleh dari sawah berupa daun daunan dan pohon ubi talas yg di masak. dan kadang-kadang di campur dedak kalau lagi musim panen padi. Setelah tiga bulan babinya laku di jual Rp 350.000\/ekor. Dengan pinjaman yang di dapat Ketut K. akan menambah lagi satu ekor ternaknya dan sisanya di pergunakan untuk membeli pakan yg lebih baik Seperti Dedak, Konsentrat dan juga Polar supaya ternaknya lebih cepat besar, di samping juga persediaan pakan di sawah mulai  susah didapat karena musim kemarau yg panjang. Dengan tambahan 1 ekor ternak dan pakan  yang juga berubah  sekarang Ketut K. yakin bisa mendapatkan hasil bersih panen ternaknya Rp 300.000\/ bulan, dan hasil ini cukup membantu menambah  biaya

one of the coordinators for the Bank of Hope Las Ungidas. She also looks after her three younger brothers who live with her. She plans to use her increased profits to help pay for their school which will resume in August. Using her house as a base, Nemesi plans to use this loan to expand her business of selling wallets, purses, shoes, and skirts. The capital, Santo Domingo, is about an hour away from her home in Los Alcarrizos and Nemesi plans to make bimonthly trips there to purchase her merchandise for the best price. \r\n\r\nNot only is Nemesi excited about expanding her business efforts, but she is also excited about the responsibilities associated with being a group coordinator. Esperanza International uses the Grameen model of group lending. This means that if one member in the group defaults, the other members are responsible for this portion too. Thus, it is important the group maintains a sense of solidarity and actively works through problems together. Nemesi is eager to help facilitate these conversations and unity. She described \u201csolidarity\u201d as a little word that has great meaning; that it means a group commitment to helping one another mutually attain goals and overcome obstacles. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn

The fish, whether fresh, fried, smoked or dried, will be sold in Bamako, at the Castle Market in S\u00e9gou and on location in Markala, for cash and seldom on credit, to a clientele made up of women and men.

She is 48 years old and is married to Jerry S., who works as a farmer. She has 8 children; one already has his own family, and the rest are still attending school. As a mother, she would like to secure the future of her children by making sure that they have very good jobs and enough earnings to support the needs of their own families when they decide to settle down. \r\n\r\nMa. Luz got married at only 19 years old because she wanted to be free of her parents' strictness. When she had her own family, she encountered a lot of hardships and problems on how to cope with their daily living. She knew that her husband's income as a farmer was not enough for them. When their first baby was born, Ma. Luz tried other ways to earn other income like putting up a small general store at the front of her house while raising ducks in her backyard. In spite of the additional business, they still encountered problems; still, they persevered.   \r\n\r\nIn 2001 Ma. Luz was able to join NWTF-Project Dungganon, which gave her additional capital for their business. With the loan, she was able to buy additional ducks to raise so that she could then sell the eggs to their neighbors. As loans continued, she learned how to handle her money. She was also able to invest in pig fattening, acquire a farmland and buy a water buffalo for their farm. Twenty six years later, Ma.Luz is more knowledgeable on how to manage her businesses. She now earns PHP 10,000 per month. Most of the profit is put in a savings account to support the education of their children and to help with the family expenses.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, Ma. Luz borrowed PHP 13,000. Said loan was paid in full and on time. Now, while on her 18th cycle, she is asking for a loan of PHP 15,000. She will use the money to buy additional ducks to raise and egg trays for the delivery of eggs. The resulting income will be used to improve her family's living conditions, pay for her children's education and renovate her house.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":425943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchasing additional ducks to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T16:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

From his shop, he sells chicken meat to his customers and generates income for the family. Chicken consumption is different in every city, but people like to eat chicken over other meats. With the loan, he will buy chickens in larger quantities, which will help him fulfill the on time demands of his customers and earn more income. \r\n\r\nNasreen resides with her family in Riwind, which is a small city located in Punjab, Pakistan and known for its dairy industry. She moved here after her marriage many years ago. She herself is a seamstress, and sews clothes for neighborhood clients. She also does embroidery work that she learned from her mother prior to marriage. She believes that in today\u2019s world it is very difficult for one person to improve the financial condition of the family when the cost of living is getting higher every day. That\u2019s why she supports her husband financially with her sewing and embroidery work. \r\n\r\nShe has 3 sons. All of them have their own shops where they also sell chicken meat to their clients. They have a good reputation among their clients due to the quality of their fresh meat. \r\n\r\nNasreen is hopeful that an investment will take her husband\u2019s business to a more profitable position and bring more money to her home. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 4th loan application.

Raima is happy with how she managed the first year in this business. Her 16 year old daughter helps her out after school and Raima has good predictions for long-term business. With the returns from her business, she purchased a dairy cow for having fresh milk products for the entire family.

She is in a common-law relationship and lives with her partner Guillermo and her 14-year-old sister, who she is supporting by providing for her education.  Candy lives in her own home and she has no children.  She produces clothing for women, men, and children and then sells these items to relatives, friends, and acquaintances.  Her designs have received good reception because they have fine finishes.  Candy says that she learned this trade by studying at a vocational center and then became independent six years ago when she purchased a sewing machine with her own capital.  Her business has grown since that time.  Now she works with an assistant who she pays for each garment she produces.  Candy enjoys her business because she has the ability to produce new designs.  However, she occasionally suffers from physical exertion as a result of cutting and sewing for several hours in the same position.  Despite the pain, she has plans to expand and grow her business.  Candy wants to open a workshop in her house by purchasing more sewing machines.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the MFP organization.  She is grateful for the opportunity to have a line of credit to help advance her business.  For this reason, Candy promises to complete her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  In addition, she feels comfortable with her Communal Bank group because she considers the members to be good people.  The amount of 3000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy a new sewing machine valued at 600 PEN, as well as sewing materials for making clothes, such as fabrics and thread.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":930370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine, fabrics, and thread.
