She is 56 years old. Artemia is married. To make a living, Artemia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Artemia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nArtemia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Artemia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Artemia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Artemia from GDMPC.

Upon graduation, Guadalupe transformed her home into 'My Little World Childcare'. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe\u2019s daycare center is a \u2018home away from home\u2019 for the children, and she has tight bonds with the children she cares for. \u201cI love celebrating their birthdays,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to watch them grow up. I get to see them get their first tooth and learn how to walk.\u201d Each day she tracks their eating habits, how they slept, and any unusual behavior, and makes reports to their parents. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe received a microloan from Opportunity Fund in 2007 to renovate her backyard and turn it into a better, safer play space for the children. She now has swing sets, a playhouse, and other toys, and the children spend time outside whenever possible. \u201cIf I had not received a loan from Opportunity Fund I still would have tried to make the safety improvements to my center, but they might not have been enough. I am afraid it could have been dangerous.\u201d \r\n\r\nWith a second loan through Opportunity Fund, this one for $8,000, Guadalupe will be able to purchase a computer to track her business expenses and a van to take the children on field trips to the nearby park and museums. She will also install a fence to separate her front yard from the

(ASHI), a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines, she immediately joined to have access to capital. With her previous loan, she bought additional fishing gear for her husband. She engages in fish vending. The income generated from their fish selling business helps in providing for their financial needs. The partnership of this couple works great so, again, she is applying for another loan worth PHP 25,000.00 pesos. She will use the funds from this loan for the construction of fish cages that her husband will maintain. They will buy materials such as fish nets, bamboo poles, and pay the labor costs for the assembly of fish cages and fingerlings to be place inside the cage. With the implementation of this plan, They will generate more profit and increase their income after only 3 months.

She is 36 years old. Mitze Marie is married and has one school-age child. To make a living, Mitze Marie owns and operates a piggery and a farm for coco production. Mitze Marie has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn February 2011, Mitze Marie joined PMPC under Barangay Official Livelihood Assistance (BOLA) program to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mitze Marie is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers for her coco farm and feeds for her piggery. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions for her family, especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, repaying loans, and educating her child.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

At also sells vegetables and fish in the village when she is free from her weaving business. Mr. Thuy has been a motor taxi driver for over twenty years. At sells her finished products to a reseller, who then takes it to sell in Phnom Penh. The couple lives in an old house and needs some money to build a new house for their family. Thus, she is requesting a loan of 1200 USD to build a new house for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":187424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

They named their group By God In Power, a Krio phrase meaning \u201cby the power of God.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThey have received previous Kiva loans through SMT. Most recently, each of them received a loan of Le 500,000, which was a great help to Zainab and Adama. The loan enabled them to expand their businesses, make additional profits, and consequently improve the living condition of members of the group.  Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are each asking for Le 800,000. \r\n\r\nZainab (right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-seven years of age and was born in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone.  She is married to a teacher, and they have had five children together.  Zainab sells several items in a kiosk on Magburaka road in Makeni. Some of the items she sells include body lotions, cigarettes, biscuits, and Peak brand powder.  She has been in the business for over ten years now.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Zainab will expand her business. She will be able to buy items in bulk to add to her business. For example, she will now be able to buy one carton of cigarettes instead of one pack at a time.

She lives with Miguel, 33 years old, and they have 2 sons; Franco, 8 years old, and Dairon, 1 year old. The family lives together in their own house, located in the rural area of Palcamayo. The main economic activity of the people who live there is agriculture. \r\n\r\nEsther took care of her parents' farm land from the time she was a young girl, and she did so with dedication. Over time she was able to buy her own land; she now plants gladiolas, spinach, lettuce, and chamomile; it is this last one that brings in the greatest income. Because of this, for the past two years they have been making chamomile tea bags (small bags that are placed in hot water for drinking). Her process is by hand and so she is working hard so that she can make the changes to modernize and expand her business. She is sure that she will make progress with this business because the curative properties of the seed for different illnesses, such as ulcers, keep this plant in high demand. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and she is very happy with the success she has had. She is sure that, with the help of her communal bank, she will make her dream a reality. With the loan she will buy 2 thousand pounds of chamomile, which, added to the 2 thousand pounds she harvested, will be enough for her to process a good quantity of chamomile tea bags. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":621777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy two thousand pounds of chamomile.

She is 63 and lives in her own home with her family.  She is the mother of 8 children who range in age from 25 to 42.  None of them is still in school.  She is also financially responsible for 2 grandchildren that live with her.  She studied through the 4th grade but didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  She saves 3,000 meticals a month in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe never left Naamacha.  She started her business to try to help her family with their income.  Years later, since there is an informal market near her home, she constructed rooms to rent out to accomodate strangers that come to trade products there.  The market is held twice a week on Thursdays and Saturdays.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 meticals.  Because her guests were eating their meals outside of her house, she started making meals to satisfy this need and also sells basic goods.  Her daughter helps her with the general management of her business and makes 3,000 meticals a month.  She saves 2,000 meticals a month in her bank.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 15,000 meticals, which she will use to buy basic goods to resell. (flour, juice, soup, soft drinks, and more).  She is confident that she will make her payments on time so she can request more loans.

She bought the bakery from her father-in-law in May so she can now manage it in a way that better suits her.  She makes batches of bread each night and sells what she makes in the mornings after.  She sells the bread from her house because she doesn't have a large enough shop for selling.  Luz says, \"I spend 70 soles a day buying flour, sugar and butter to make\" [a nightly batch of bread].  She says, too, that she makes back the 70 soles she spends on supplies plus another 70 soles.  \"It's very profitable\", she adds.  Her husband helps her with the business.  She also has an employee who she pays by the month to help her with the difficult and tiring work.  She and her husband rented before, but they own their own house now.  Luz's drive to get ahead knows no bounds: she is processing the paperwork to get the licenses she needs to operate the business as both a bakery and a shop.

However, it is difficult to procure fertilizer because the there are no nearby fertilizer vendors.  Seeing this condition, I made Wenten saw a business opportunity.

Khusus untuk lingkungan I Made Wenten, sebagian besar petani bercocok tanam dengan menanam padi. Hal ini disebabkan karena pengairan diwilayah tersebut mencukupi untuk menanam padi. Sebagai seorang petani, I Made Wenten paham akan kebutuhan para petani pada saat masa tanam.\r\nPetani di desa I Made Wenten sangat membutuhkan pupuk untuk meningkatkan produktifitas sawahnya. Namun yang menjadi kendala adalah sulitnya mencari pupuk karena selain jarak pedagang pupuk yang cukup jauh, ketersediaan pupuk pun sangat minim. Melihat hal ini, I Made Wenten menganggap sebagi peluang bisnis yang bisa diandalkan. Selain tetap mengerjakan sawahnya sendiri, I Made Wenten melayani penjualan beraneka jenis pupuk yang diperlukan oleh petani. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, I Made Wenten membeli pupuk di pedagang besar dan memasarkannya kembali. Para petani merasa sangat terbantu dengan usaha I Made Wenten, karena mereka dapat dengan mudah memperoleh pupuk. Satu hal yang sangat dihargai oleh para petani adalah layanan antar oleh I Made Wenten kepada para pembeli.

She is 28 years old and married with three children aged between 1 1\/2 and 9 years.  Two of her children go to school, and the other one is still young.  She owns a five-room house where she lives with eight people. Phiona doesn\u2019t take care of any additional family members. Her house has no electricity but there is piped water.  The family gets three meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nPhiona resides and works in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala. Phiona sells second-hand clothes in Namungoona Market (one of the city's suburbs). She sells to an average of 20 people a day, and works six days a week. Phiona\u2019s major monthly expenses include rent for the business, school fees, and medication. She incurs extra transport costs traveling to and from Kampala to shop. She has been in this business for the last six years. \r\n<p>\r\nPhiona\u2019s main challenges are the increasing prices of goods and competition. Phiona has been with MCDT for over five years and is servicing her ninth  loan, working with the same group mates the whole time. She wants to use this loan partly to pay school fees for her children and partly to buy more clothes for resale. Phiona aspires to own a container full of second-hand clothes.\r\n.\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n

He finished the 10th grade because his parents didn't have financial resources, so he had to start working to help at home. He lives in his own house with his family and he also supports his mother in Montepuez sending her money to pay electricity, water and food.\r\n\r\nHe left Montepuez in 1979 to fulfill the military service which is obligatory in Maputo. He continues in the army and is part of the Ministry of National Defense. He earns a salary of 6.555MT and after household expenses he is able to save some money at the Commercial Bank BIM.\r\n\r\nHe learned about Hlvuku thru a co-worker so he decided to approach the institution, he doesn't have credit at other financial institutions. This is his first loan for 10.000MT, and he expects to use it to buy construction materials (nails, iron, cement, wires and metal sheets of zinc) to build the frame of his house.\r\n\r\nHis biggest challenge has been the price increase of construction materials, but he promises to pay the loan without any problems in order to request other loans to finish his house and leave the old house that was built out of precarious material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva

The couple is blessed with five children, some of whom are still in school. They live in the village of Sitio Nasug-ong, Brgy Caradio-an, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband meet their family's needs, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 to earn additional income. She began by buying and selling fruit in front of their house. Then she began selling clothing, where she earned enough money to help tremendously with her family's needs. As she secured additional loans, she looked for other ways to earn money. Now she makes a living selling fish to people in her local community. From this businesses, she earns a minimum of PHP 11,800 per month.  This has allowed her to educate her children and meet many household expenses. \r\n\r\nFlorenda's previous loan of Php19,500 was used for her fish-selling business. She paid it on time and without any delay. Now she has applied for a new loan of PHP 19,500 which we will use to sell fruits and selling of fruits and clothing.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges,  Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in  the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He is a 31-year-old trader. He lives with his wife in a rented apartment in a community in the western region of Ghana. He trades in garment tie dye material. Tie dye is designed from the combination of plain white cloth soaked in mixed dye to get the actual design. Tie dye is very useful and beautiful, so many people purchase it. The fabric can be sewn into African wear and it can also be used to sew a traditional style of clothing. Benjamin treks to Takoradi to buy his stock of goods. For lack of adequate working capital, he buys only a small amount of lace material and sells through hawking. He believes the loan will enable him to grow his business to the expected level. With the loan, he wants to purchase lace materials and textiles in bulk.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Judith lives in her parents' house in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nShe began her economic activity by opening a small grocery store at home. In time, she noted that it wasn't profitable for lack of capital, and for this reason, she approached her parents who helped her to open a restaurant. Judith has spent the last 3 months at her new trade. She sells a variety of dishes but only during breakfast, since having supplies for mornings, afternoons and nights would require a larger investment. In this manner, Judith has recuperated her initial investment and earns 40 to 50 sols daily.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Judith was working in a state office as a receptionist, added income that helped positively in the development of herself and her minor daughter. But she had to leave that job because her business absorbed much of her time.

She is living alone with her two (02) children and four (04) other children whom she cares for. Abandoned by her husband who has been living clandestinely in Europe for more than 5 years, Madam Adjoa BLEVI courageously manages to support all her family expenditures. Having dropped out of primary school very early, she started bread selling along roads and streets. Very ingenious, she has early understood that to better succeed in life, she must be her own mistress. That is why she underwent the training in bread making. Also enterprising and very courageous, she didn\u2019t hesitate, from her first credit to build a hard packed oven for bread making and selling. Thanks to the quality of her breads, she is more and more solicited but she is very limited by her means and cannot satisfy her clients who are getting more and more numerous. Madam Adjoa A. really induces trust through the quality of her products and especially the good management of her two credits of $ 450 and $ 650 respectively. She promptly paid reimbursed.\r\n\r\nThe new credit of $ 850 in request will serve to buy the wheat flour and sugar in order to assure availability in stock as in the period of Christmas and New Year those stuffs become scarce and expensive.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the eleventh loan taken out by Mary Jane from GDMPC.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When her husband passed away it was very hard for her family to come to terms with the cruel turn in their lives. Sadafmo worried how to make enough money to feed her children. She decided that selling fruits and vegetables at the market would provide enough income for her family and has been successful in this business for the last 16 years. Her children help her out as well and they purchased a car for easier transport of the produce from the farms to the market. Currently Sadafmo would like to take out a loan of 2300 US dollars to purchase melons and squash to sell. She hopes that the lenders will support her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":846833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Courageous and enterprising, he took care of himself thanks to household tasks he performed at various homes after training sessions. He successfully finished his training but it took him a long time to open his own workshop because he did not have the required resources.

His clients however did not quit because of the quality of his furniture. Mr. H. is married with a seamstress and they have no children yet.

About half of them have had at least a little education, although none has completed more than the sixth graD..

Before they had access to credit, many were unable to pay the small costs associated with sending their children to school.  Now, with the help of loans, they are able to work more and fight for a better future for their children.  More directly, those working in clothing-related industries will use their loans to purchase cloth, thread, patterns and clothes in bulk, while the woman selling vegetables and chickens will use her loan to buy seeds, fertilizer and more chickens.\r\n\r\n<p>Several of the women also report that, in addition to being able to expand their businesses and send their children to school, having access to credit has enabled them to make improvements on their houses, such as getting better roofs or buying more cinder blocks to have more solid walls.  When asked what they like most about working together in the Flor D. Mayo group, they all agreed that it is a great group because everyone always pays on time and there is a lot of trust among the members.  They also report that they have found the informal education programs that Friendship Bridge offers at the regular group meetings to be very helpful.  Not only have they learned basic business administration and money management skills, but several say that their favorite lesson of all was learning about natural medicines such as plants, some of which they already had on hand although they never knew the benefit they could proviD..  \r\n\r\n<p>When asked about their dreams, these women report that more than anything they hope their children won\u2019t suffer as they have suffered.

She is a hard-working woman who is always seeking to make a significant contribution to the household finances.  She does so with her embroidery, which began as a hobby helping one of her friends, then she realized that this work is profitable as well as enjoyable.  She did not hesitate to begin her own business producing \"talqueado\" embroideries for costume parties called \"Santiagos\".  <p><p>\r\n\r\nShe has seen a profit from these 3 years of intense work and today her husband also encourages her to keep embroidering.  He also engages in agricultural work and in the sale of firewood.  In spite of the short time that her childcare leaves Rufina, she never stops working in her own home every day creating these beautiful embroideries, which realize their profit when they are sold after a month's labor.  <p><p>\r\n\r\nRufina's motivation is to give the best to her three children in school.

Their marriage is gifted with three children: Shermae Michelle \u2013 a 16-year-old first year nursing student; Sermil Micheal \u2013 a 13-year-old junior high school student, and Shella Mae \u2013 a 10-year-old Grade 4 elementary student.  The family lives in Barangay Magsaysay Naguillan, Isabela. <p>\r\n\r\nMildred\u2019s store has been a big help in their family, as each week she can earn a gross income of at least $320, budgeting that income to support the studies of her eldest, since the nursing course is very expensive, and for the educational needs of her other two children.  Some of the earnings are also used to maintain their corn and rice farming business.  <p>\r\n\r\nTo further sustain her store and farming business, Mildred is requesting a loan as additional capital with which she will buy more stocks to offer in her store.  The said amount will make her store profitable and hopefully enable her to convert it into a grocery store.  In this way, she can provide for the immediate needs of the people in the community and make it more convenient for them because they will not have to go to the market just to acquire their basic requirements.  <p>\r\n\r\nThrough the income from her business, Mildred is able to provide the medication for her eldest child who is suffering from lupus, a chronic auto-immune disease that can be fatal. She prays that they can prevail in their struggle and that her child will be cured.  She loves her family and becomes teary- eyed whenever she remembers her child's sickness.  According to Mildred, her child is strongly fighting her sickness and this gives her the strength to overcome it.  \r\n\r\n

She has had her business since 2005 of selling vegetables in her village, but it was hard to gain extra capital to buy more goods and be able to increase her profit.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from ASHI of 12,000 Pesos, she will be able to buy a larger quantity of vegetables and also is going to buy a few small piglets for pig fattening, a popular business here. She will buy them seed, supplements and vitamins and sell them after about six months when they are ready to go to market.\r\n\r\nHer greatest hope is to rise out of poverty. With more of her vegetables in production and this extra source of income from the hogs, she believes she will be able to save money to send her kids to school and hopefully one day

It was in this way that she managed to get her own business, and throughout it all she has been able to count on Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000, which has provided her with many loans.  This loan is for capital for her work, for the purchase of cosmetics, brushes, scissors, dyes, shampoo and conditioner, because at this time she is getting many customers.  Her wish is to keep her business lively so that her children may get their daily sustenance.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

SPBD's loans are Temukisa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Temukisa P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She started it with some money from a settlement and with her husband's help.\r\n\r\nMaria wakes up in the early morning hours to sell.  In the past months she has not sold enough.  Because sales have dropped, she would like to buy more basic products like dry grains, dairy products, sweets, canned goods, and other things.  This is to increase sales by rotating goods, since there are many costs to pay for water, light, food, and more.  Among her plans is to gain an increase in stock in order to improve her home by painting it so that it will look pretty. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Flavia Garcia, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":553604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of dry grains, canned goods, sweets, chickens, meat, and more to increase her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Tereza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.16,"local_amount":1247.72,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1281.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562215},{"amount":116.91,"local_amount":2424.83,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2489.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771117},{"amount":55.77,"local_amount":1156.7,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1187.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330701},{"amount":114.74,"local_amount":2379.76,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2443.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465856},{"amount":57.11,"local_amount":1184.55,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1216.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097994},{"amount":56.31,"local_amount":1167.88,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766250},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":1176.5,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1207.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209309},{"amount":56.32,"local_amount":1168.18,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078141},{"amount":100.96,"local_amount":2093.88,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2149.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147255}],"funded_date":"2010-07-06T17:15:42Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Flavia Garcia (vol)","image":1574380}},{"id":211564,"name":"La Presa De Chosto Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo de llama La Presa de Chosto, se ubica en el Estado de M\u00e9xico.

She is seeking a loan to buy pants, shirts, and sweaters for women and men. She has around 100 clients in the areas of Chost, La Mesa, and Lanzados; little by little she has become known in the region. Initially she had a sewing workshop (15 years ago) in which she produced clothing. For personal reasons, she closed the business and distributed the capital among her associates, and from there came the idea to sell clothing. While asking for this loan, she is happy and satisfied to invest the credit into her business, as this season is good for sales due to school closures. She has orders from various clients and has to buy the clothing and distribute it. She is 38 years old, has a sixth-grade education, and is married with six children. She is originally from Mesa de Chosto. She wants this loan so she buy clothing to fill the orders of her clients. She also hopes to start another type of business. On weekends, she sells tostadas in the municipality of Acambay, and she would like to have an establishment for selling traditional foods. As a medium-term project, she has a place to display the clothing, since she has been walking house to house selling her clothes, suffering from inclement weather.\r\n\r\nThe other members are:\r\nNAME: ACTIVITY\r\nROSALBA M.R.: Food\r\nALICIA M.

her family who live both in the United States and in Brazil. Gina has no employees and her husband and son both work at different companies.\r\n\r\nFour years ago Gina started her house-cleaning business because she saw that the cleaning business was strong in the U.S. She saw the opportunity to grow in this area by starting a business in her hometown. Now, she hopes to gain more clients by using her first ACCION USA loan to advertise her business. She plans to make her services more visible in the surrounding area because there is a large population she has not yet targeted.\r\n\r\nGina loves being her own boss and having that personal contact with her clients. Her greatest challenge was having the courage to start her own business. Now, she is confident enough in her service and day-to-day operations that she wants to further grow her clientele. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

She raises these animals at home, feeding them with natural grasses. Once they have reached a good level of development she offers them for sale to the merchants who often visit the area where she lives. With the income this business brings her she helps her husband, who is a farmer, with maintaining the household economy. \r\n\r\nClorinda wishes to expand her pens and purchase fodder so that her sheep may develop in better conditions.

He makes furniture to order for his clients. Nelson comments that he sees a lot of demand for his products, since they are finely finished, and he is one of the least expensive craftsmen in the city. <p>He sadly tells the story of how he was robbed 22 days ago. The thieves took the motor of one of his wood cutting tools. He urgently needs to buy another in order to continue working and supporting his family. <p>The motor will cost up to $200 and Nelson needs a loan with which to buy it. <p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>Nelson tiene 42 a\u00f1os, es casado y vive con su esposa Zunilda que tiene 45 a\u00f1os.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and payback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To buy beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces for her cafe.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436329},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130601},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027398},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613399},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010479}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T21:45:15Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":83726,"name":"J Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or J Guadalupe V.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

For this reason, he is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles so that he can meet his objective.\r\n<p>\r\nNavil hopes that his business will continue to grow so that he can provide his children with a quality education.  He is a responsible father who is dedicated to his family and to his work.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Because of its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s needs. Being a good mother, Flor has always wanted to support her children in whatever career they would be taking to better their own personal life. The fishing business is her way of saving money to support the needs of her family, especially to pay for her six children's education until college.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s support of her fishing business is Flor Hazel\u2019s motivation to continue expanding her business despite the trials of poverty. Over time, she has been able to purchase a fishing boat for her husband to manage and use for fishing. Meanwhile, Flor Hazel is the one who sells his fish directly to people in local community and nearby town of Tobias Fornier, Antique.\r\n\r\nFlor Hazel is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase an additional fishing boat to catch more fish to sell. This would help their business grow, and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambition in life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":586009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchasing

Venancia has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Venancia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venancia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Venancia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used for house repair. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Venancia from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.
