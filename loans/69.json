When she joined the Fund in 1998, her family\u2019s financial conditions encountered many difficulties. Her husband had died early, when all children were still young and there was not enough capital to make a living. After joining the Fund, she borrowed money to buy and resell scrap. Over her 10 years of participation to the Fund, she managed to raise all the children thanks to her assiduous work and thriftiness. The 3 eldest children are now grown up and her family\u2019s economy has improved significantly. The children currently work in the family\u2019s carpentry business. For the next round, she would like to borrow 10.000.000 \u0111 for the children to purchase a new sawing machine, and use the remainder of the loan to buy scrap.

from Tanzania! Tabitha is a thirty-six-year-old married woman with three children between the ages of five and fourteen. She lives in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania, where she opened a clothing store called Tabby Designs in 2006. She runs the store with one employee and the assistance of her children, all of whom are also enrolled in school. Tabitha sells traditional African cloth (called boutque), unique handcrafted accessories, and handicrafts to locals and tourists. The outfit you see Tabitha wearing in this picture is one she has made herself from boutque cloth! She has been making a monthly profit of approximately 500 USD from her store that she uses to supplement her husband's income and contribute to the family. Tabitha is requesting a first-time loan of 450 USD to purchase cloth and dyes to customize the traditional clothing that she sells. Tabitha is an exceptionally hard worker who spends eleven hours per day at her store for six days a week. In the future, with increased profits earned as a result of anticipated increased sales of her unique goods, Tabitha hopes to improve the quantity and range of products offered at her store.  \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":191067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase raw materials for her clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T19:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-02T05:02:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345764},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347905},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970479},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886696},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435958},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130262}],"funded_date":"2008-08-19T05:02:47Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":64679,"name":"Zahira's Tusaidiane Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahira is 24 years old.

They are doing their best in providing a better life for their children, so they will not have to experience what their parents have been through.  Because of the struggles they had, Imelda was motivated to maintain her hog-raising business for them to have an alternative source of income.  At present, she is seeking financial assistance amounting to PHP 3,000 that she will use to buy feed supplies and hopefully expand the business. The financial assistance would be a great opportunity for Imelda to improve their living conditions.

M. is 65 years old and has four children who no longer depend on her.  She sells flowers at her stall in the square in front of the Universal Cemetery of Barranquilla.  She began to work with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 11 years ago when a consultant observed her and saw her performance.  With the loan of 1,600 Colombian pesos she is asking for, she wants to stock up with artificial and fresh flowers like anthuriums, roses, flower buds, carnations and orchids, which she can get more economically in Maicao, a border city near Venezuela.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's flower sales business came into being after she abandoned the merchandise sales she had done in Maicao and moved to Barranquilla for security reasons.  She began her business selling flowers with a friend who had the capital, and they got equal profits after the sale.  As this went well for her, she decided to become independent, and during her eleven years with the Fundaci\u00f3n she has had much success with her business.  She says that her greatest challenge is the competition she gets from other people whom Mar\u00eda has taught how to sell flowers.  She used to sit in her tent waiting for people to come look for her, but now she looks for her customers around the cemetery, which has helped her to keep those customers and promote her business; the result is that people come to her, even people from other departments in Colombia whose loved ones are in other cemeteries.  They have a lot of confidence in her since she know how to preserve flowers  Her successes help her to make her dreams come true, and her main dream is to have more capital to supply her business, especially with fresh flowers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":505390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stock artificial and fresh flowers like anthuriums, roses, flower buds, carnations and orchids","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-14T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71187},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76641},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78110},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79607},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81133},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82688},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84273},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85888},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87534},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":89212},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90922},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":92664},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94440},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96250},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98095},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99975},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101892},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109489}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":71187,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":72781.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677885},{"amount":40.71,"local_amount":76641,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78357.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712266},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":78110,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":79859.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895766},{"amount":729.97,"local_amount":1374062,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1404832.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636093}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T00:05:48Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":188447,"name":"Naseem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naseem, a resident of of the Pakistani city of Borewala, famous for its shrines, is the wife of I., who has operated a vegetable-selling business  for over 25 years.

about five miles away from Magburaka town. This school was established by the Roman Catholics in 1966 to promote education in Sierra Leone. Currently, the school has 10 teachers on its payroll list and 2 unpaid teachers with 285 pupils.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nSixty-two-year-old Augustine M.A. F. (pictured on the right) is the headmaster at the school, and has been a teacher for 43 years.

Ben\u00edtez came from El Carmen de Bol\u00edvar to Barranquilla with her spouse and three children seeking peace and economic stability.  At first they arrived at a relative\u2019s who helped them out.  Later, when her husband got a job as a watchman at a towing site, they moved.  In time, her husband\u2019s boss gave them a room that they gradually enlarged and they started their business of raising animals to sell their meat.  Today, they are in this line of work and they butcher 60 pigs.  Luz Mar\u00eda is in charge of this particular task while her husband works at a saw mill where she secured the business of preparing daily lunches there for 35 employees and daily her business grows.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th loan with the Foundation and she\u2019s asking for a Kiva loan in the amount of $1.000.000 COP to buy pigs to raise for subsequent pork sales as well as to acquire larger amounts of raw materials and ingredients to prepare the lunches she sells.\r\n\r\nThe loans have made it possible for her to increase profits and buy a car that she uses in the business.  Her dream is focused on buying a house and this is the great challenge she faces: the constant need to save in order to reach it.\r\n\r\nHowever, she  learned how to overcome her challenges since she arrived in Barranquilla with only the wish to get ahead, pushed by the need to provide security and wellbeing for her children who were then little.

After that, she was more confident to borrow and expand this model of rearing pigs. Currently, she is also raising chickens and ducks. Besides raising livestocks, her husband also carries out transportation service so their family's income is stable. Her 2 grown-up children also have stable jobs. This time round, she would like to borrow 10,000,000VND (600USD) to purchase more animal feeds to raise livestocks. She will also purchase more pigs. Her family's monthly income is 4,000,000VND (about 258USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Vinh n\u0103m nay 45 tu\u1ed5i.

from Tanzania! Elizabeti is thirty-six years old and married with three children, two of whom are in school. She has an additional dependent, Benjamin, whom she takes care of because his parents are unable to provide for him. She owns a beauty salon in Dar es Salaam that she runs along with one employee and with the assistance of her children. Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. Elizabeti earns about 300 USD per month from the salon as a result of working long hours every day of the week. She is requesting a loan of 275 USD to purchase cosmetics, wigs, and other hair products for her salon. In the future, with increased profits gained by serving additional clients, Elizabeti hopes to expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.g"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-20T00:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-03T11:29:28Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346857},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":31266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347910},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970484},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886701},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435962},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130265},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027096},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613136},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010219},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232534}],"funded_date":"2008-08-20T11:29:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":64695,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"L\u00e0 m\u1ed9t ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef s\u1ed1ng \u1edf v\u00f9ng n\u00f4ng th\u00f4n \u0111\u00e3 l\u00e2u n\u0103m n\u00ean c\u00f4 K. \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 r\u1ea5t nhi\u1ec1u kinh nghi\u1ec7m trong ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i.

She also gets work from various local companies assembling their industrial uniforms; in addition, she installed a perfume sales stand in the market located on the street where she lives, which gives her an additional form of income. \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of 4,000 MXN that she will pay in 10 installments, given that she is planning on purchasing work materials such as: fabric, buttons, thread, zippers, etc., to assemble the spring costumes that have already been requested by local schools. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":292879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase work materials such as: fabrics, buttons, threads, zippers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Villa de Garc\u00eda, N.L.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-03-25T06:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037366},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927803},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927804},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382872},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:08Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382873},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889543},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889544},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111034},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111035},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532628}],"funded_date":"2009-03-25T07:27:15Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":101573,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more grains and then sell them to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613714},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010793},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233079},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664870},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105582},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022698},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867943},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757144},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146256},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984418}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T02:46:39Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105669,"name":"Maria Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria luz es socia del Banco Comunal Reto\u00f1o.\nMaria Luz es casada, tiene 30 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, vive en el distrito de Acocro, Maria Luz tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general, verduras.

She is 59 years old. Agripina is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Agripina operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising cows for sale. Agripina is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Agripina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Agripina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Agripina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Agripina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Asa grows and sells fruits and vegetables. Asa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 320 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Asa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Asa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. She used her previous loan to buy farm supplies and equipment. Asa is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST to buy farm supplies and equipment. This will be Asa's second loan from SPBD. Asa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She hopes to make every single member of the group happy by offering each one a part of the loan. \r\n\r\nDilbarkhon B., 49, is a leader of this group. For the past two years, she and her husband have been involved in a cattle reselling business. Most of the work is done by Dilbarkhon, because her husband\u2019s main occupation is construction. Purchasing cattle is not a simple process. Customers usually pay careful attention to the physical appearance of the animal, its health and price. Sometimes Dilbarkhon has to wait several days in order to sell the cattle at a good price. Thanks to her good bargaining skills, she is usually successful. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t get help from her children in taking care of the cattle, because all three of them are pursuing a degree in the bigger city of Osh. She is happy with how life has turned out and wishes her children the best. After thorough consideration of the financial possibilities, Dilbarkhon applied for a loan, which she would like to spend on buying more cattle. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

While Nick\u2019s office is in his home, the bikes are built by students at a Detroit high school. The partnering school has a great deal of existing capacity for building, as well as a network for the next generation of cyclists, mechanics, and machinists. Founded in March, this bike project entails designing and manufacturing handmade bicycle trailers. Sales are generated in the neighborhood through open houses, in the city through retail outlets, and nationally through Nick\u2019s website.  In Detroit there is a huge demand for public transportation as it is minimal and unreliable; expanding the capacity of bikes is an opportunity to impact change in the community. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from ACCION USA, Nick will purchase materials for the bikes and advertise the project. Nick hopes to cultivate the positive relationship with the school, allow students to continue working on the project and spread the word about the great need for transportation in Detroit. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information About This Loan \r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva Detroit and in partnership with Michigan Corps.  Kiva Detroit is the first Kiva City, a program where Kiva works with community organizations and field partners in the United States to provide local small businesses with microloans. Michigan Corps is the first community organization to work with Kiva in Detroit, and conducts outreach through small business networks, churches, community foundations, and across many personal and social media networks.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

group. They are local entrepreneurs based in Makeni city, located in northern Sierra Leone. To date, these entrepreneurs have received several loans from SMT\/Kiva.

As a result of this, they have been able to provide their children with three meals a day, send them to school and solve most of their daily financial challenges. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are again requesting a new loan of Le 1,200,000 so that each of them can further improve her businesses. \r\n\r\nFatu J.

She is 63-years old, married with one adult child.  Laura owns and operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of revenue for the business comes from selling everyday use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Laura has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Laura joined Kiva partner GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Laura has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Laura is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Laura from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":371935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 57 years old. Luz is single. To make a living, Luz owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products like beverages in the local community. Luz has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luz joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Luz is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Luz from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

This city is a fusion of 3 rich cultures in its traditional symbolism and art, the Ca\u00f1ari, Inca and Spanish.  The members of this bank are women who are heads of their households, and who struggle to provide for their families.  They are a happy and supportive group; they are always ready to work together so that they all see their families advance economically.\r\n\r\nLuisa F. is 49 years old and lives in a rented house in the suburb of the city of Cuenca with 3 of her 6 children.  The three oldest of her children are already married and live independently.  Her children who are 16 and 13 years old study at a night school so they can work and help their mother at home, since they have no father.\r\n\r\nLuisa has worked as a cook in the restaurant Pio Pio for 15 years, and her schedule rotates from 8am to 4pm, to 3pm to 11pm.  When one of her co-workers does not show up, she has to double her shift.  In addition to this activity she raises chickens, but only to enjoy at home and not for a business.\r\n\r\nLuisa joined the communal bank \"Alianza Unida\" 5 years ago; she was encouraged by a neighbor who is also a member.  The loans have helped her to get ahead with her children, and to have the habit of saving.  The money from the loan she requests will be invested in the education of her children, paying school fees and buying new uniforms.  If there is any money left she will also buy more chickens. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to buy herself some land so that, little by little, she can start building her own home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":487079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay school fees and buy new uniforms for her children, and also to buy chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T00:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910753},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946429},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946430},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674728},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708884}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T05:09:20Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":180087,"name":"Rachele Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rachele Ann M. is from the village of Villa Verde, Balulang, Cagayan De Oro City.

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times at the CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues and she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her food business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying groceries and raw ingredients needed to continue the sale of her snack items.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":565113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buying groceries and ingredients needed to continue producing and selling of her snack items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-07-07T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4188.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608170},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2792.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821681},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3490.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088925}],"funded_date":"2010-07-08T03:07:30Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":217157,"name":"Saroeurn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Saroeurn B., age 40, and is a villager who lives in Sam raong village, Takeo province.

Gargato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and a food vending business. Her husband Joel P., who is 28 years old, works as a driver, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is five years old. Ronavic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to achieve something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ronavic has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 4000 increased her monthly income to PHP 6000, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to stock her general store so that she may continue to save up for her child's education. Ronavic P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nLorna operates a direct selling business and manages a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale price and selling at piece rate prices. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 350 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLorna dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

T\u00f4 Th\u1ecb  (20206030049) is a 52-year-old woman living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc N.. She is married and has three adult children.  \n\nTo making a living, N. sells liquor such as beer and wine in the local community. N. has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 3,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, N. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. N. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,496,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering.  \n\nN. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to buy more products to meet the demand of customer. This will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  N. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout SEDA:\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro finance services to the low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nN.

She is married and has five school-aged children.\r\n\r\nTali owns and operates a business running a food stall, selling a variety of food products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tali joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\r\n\r\nTali is now requesting a new loan of 1,750 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. The loan will be her 3rd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is 26 years old. Agnes is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by the Kiva field partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nAgnes is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Agnes owns and operates a business selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Agnes has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $43 a month from this activity.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Agnes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Agnes is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Their decision paid off since their business has steadily grown; they now have an employee and clients who sell their products locally.\r\n\r\nMedardo and his wife, originally from Honduras, heard about ACCION USA from their daughter. The proceeds of their loan will be used to purchase bathing suits and sportswear and other items from their suppliers' Summer 2010 collection. This investment ensures that they can fill orders fast, better serving their clients and, hopefully, increasing profits.\r\n\r\n \r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":485066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Su esposo trabaja como alba\u00f1il.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora  se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de leche pues tiene sus vacas, de las cuales orde\u00f1a leche y hace quesillo, para vender a sus vecinos, adem\u00e1s se la producci\u00f3n eventual de haba, ma\u00edz en su casita que le ayudan a sustentar su hogar y a sus hijitos.

El ideal que tiene la se\u00f1ora Lourdes es poder hacer estudiar a su hija Veterinaria, ya que ella nunca puedo cumplir sus sue\u00f1os de estudiar una carrera; con el crecimiento de su negocio de la producci\u00f3n de lecher\u00eda podr\u00e1 pagar sus estudios de su hija mayor.\nLa visi\u00f3n que tiene la se\u00f1ora Lourdes es ver a sus hijos crecer sanos y fuertes, responsables, y que ellos logren tener un futuro mejor que ella tuvo adem\u00e1s capaces de poder enfrentar cualquier dificultad que la vida les ponga en frente.\n","en":"Lourdes Rodr\u00edguez, age 42, just has a fifth grade education.  She has four children.  Her children are 18, 12, 7, and 5.  Lourdes and her children live in the Mallcorrancho area of Sipe-Sipe.  Her husband works as a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nShe devotes herself to milk production.  She has cows that she milks, and she makes cheese to sell to her neighbors.  She also occasionally grows beans at home, which helps her to maintain her home and her children.  \r\n\r\nLourdes has three children from her first husband, and he left them many years ago.  During that time she met Issac V\u00e1squez Ledezma.  He helped her a lot from then on; he helped her start the dairy business.  They are now married, and they have one more child.  The conditions in which they live are meager. They have a house with small adobe rooms.  She keeps her cattle on the same property. \r\n\r\nLourdes is very dedicated to her work.  She and her daughter get up very early everyday to milk the cows.  They then take the milk to be able to sell it.  Luckily, they now deliver their milk to the Milk Industrialization Plant unit.  They are paid regularly every 15 days for the milk they have delivered.  The prices are low.\r\n\r\nLourdes is requesting the loan to be able to buy a dairy cow and balanced food so that she is able to produce more milk and increase her income.  The idea that Lourdes has is that her daughter be able to study to be a veterinarian.  Lourdes could never fulfill her dreams of studying a career.  With the growth of her milk production business she could pay for her oldest daughter\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nThe vision that Lourdes has is to see her children grow healthy, strong and responsible.  She wants them to have a better future than she had.  She also wants them to be capable of confronting whatever difficulty confronts them in life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 34 years old. Rona is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rona owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, breads, canned goods and snack foods in the local community. Rona has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Rona is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP that will be used to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Rona from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":644172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 66 years old. Restituta is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Restituta owns and operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from cultivating fruit trees and harvesting their fruit to sell. Restituta has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Restituta joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Restituta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Restituta is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will also be used to expand the business. This loan will be the 17th loan taken out by Restituta from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She owns and operates a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  She has many years of experience in this business. Lupe needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase weed killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Lupe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Lupe's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\". For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":932595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She says the family members of her husband put pressure on her to work as if she is a servant to them. She has thought of renting a house but she is constrained by lack of funds to run her business, never mind talk of money to rent a single room.

She makes her sales by \u2018hawking\u2019, which is door-to-door sales in the community. Georgina is an achiever and her focus is on saving enough to see her kids through school.

Her plan is to have a small business in her house so that she can quit her job in the kitchen (which she is quite tired of). \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":322556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials for a new roof","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-05-24T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adilia Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":451.06,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":485.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890935},{"amount":26.02,"local_amount":462.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":497.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112261},{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":454.72,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":489.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533664},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":446.64,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":480.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965023},{"amount":25.78,"local_amount":458.29,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":492.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875479},{"amount":24.51,"local_amount":435.74,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":468.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713405},{"amount":22.62,"local_amount":402.08,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":432.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601103},{"amount":50,"local_amount":888.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:30Z","rounded_local_amount":956.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002576}],"funded_date":"2009-05-24T17:44:22Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cyrus Maher","image":null}},{"id":113909,"name":"Khanh's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khanh Th\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng was born in 1975.( no: 010102090016).

The school was built in 1989 by a Muslim leader, with a body of religious and businesswomen to help educate the children of Makeni city and the surrounding villages. This school (a junior secondary school) has a total of 38 staff and 500 pupils. It is one of the most advanced secondary schools in Makeni city. Over the years, the school has produced teachers, doctors, lawyers, accountants, ministers and so on.\r\n<p>\r\nTeachers are one of the poorest paid workers in Sierra Leone. Because of this, many of them find alternative means of making a living. Some engage in business or agriculture while others organize extra classes for pupils. These teachers are therefore seeking a loan in order to embark on meaningful projects. They will gradually repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.\r\n<p>\r\nIdrissa A.

She lives alone in a rented room and what she wants most is to improve her quality of life. Maximiliana's business is the sale of cheese. Consequently, she leaves very early to deliver the cheeses, which she previously buys from the towns Taraco and Saman. She takes them to the main markets of Juliaca, where she is eagerly awaited by her clients, who already know the quality of her product. What she likes best about her work is the freedom she has in her work schedule. From doing this activity for six years independently, the most laborious part is obtaining good quality cheese, as she already has an earned reputation before her customers and she does not want to lose it. From now on, she expects to raise the necessary capital to rent a store stall and be able to offer her customers a better service. This is her fourth loan with MFP. She knows that she has to pay all the dues on time so that it will not cause problems for her other companions from her communal bank as she is very esteemed for being a very responsible person.

She has four children, one of whom helps with making the bedrolls (as shown in the photograph).  Her husband is a farmer.  Do\u00f1a Concha has been making bedrolls for approximately 20 years, as well as purses and fans.  She learned this craft after taking a course at home that was being offered by the government.  The loan she requested will be used to purchase more materials such as straw, string, paint, ribbons, and marsh lilies.  By making these products, she hopes to preserve the traditions of her town.  She sells her products directly to the public in order to avoid middlemen.\r\n<p>\r\nThis group is very close and the members have known each other since birth.

For 18 years she has grown peas, potatoes, gladioli and maize on the land she owns, counting on the help of her husband. Parallel to this she has also raised horses and donkeys, who help her to transport her products and tools to the land where she works during the day. Yolanda likes growing peas and gladioli because they are the products in greatest demand in the market, particularly during festival times. Without question it's difficult for Yolanda to have to transport what she harvests and to pay for the transport, but she knows that her profits depend on this. In the most recent harvest season Yolanda took her product to the wholesale market in Lima where she received better economic returns. In the future Yolanda wants to grow peas in a larger quantity and install a food sale business in her house. This is her second loan with MFP, and she is happy to continue working with the members of her communal bank as they know her working methodology which she likes very much. With the loan she is seeking Yolanda thinks to invest in the purchase of 2 bags of pea seeds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":581353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase pea seeds ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T05:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326888}],"funded_date":"2010-08-10T13:40:39Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":225381,"name":"Carlos Arturo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Carlos Arturo tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene dos hijos los cuales son menores de edad.

She has her own clientele and lately the business has been growing and the number of customers has increased which leads to higher income to meet her daily household expenses.  She also raises barnyard fowl and once they fatten up she sells them to her customers or in the various local markets.\r\n\r\nTo continue carrying out her activities like she\u2019s done to date, she feels it\u2019s necessary to request a 2000 new sol loan from Edpyme Alternativa to buy ingredients to continue making bread and to do some improvements to the locale where her bakery operates as well as to buy feed for her animals.  With income she earns she will be able to repay the loan and have a few more comforts.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Esther and her husband have learned how to get ahead through much effort and work in order to attain what they have proposed for themselves.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":838616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to
