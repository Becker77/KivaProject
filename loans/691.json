A. arrived in the city of Barranquilla 17 years ago  She had become a widow with three children and decided to seek a better life.  Initially she worked as a domestic worker for two years, during which time she perfected her way of preparing meals.  She therefore stopped this activity and joined with her current spouse who was devoted to her.  At first she sold servings of soup, and today's main activity is the sale of lunches on a daily basis to 35 construction workers.  She has added to this the sale of cheese fingers and cold drinks, especially beer, on the weekends, when she sells at least 30 cases.  She also offers cell phone services, an activity that provides additional income.  Her daughter supports her in this business, she is paid daily and is directly employed by the business.\r\n\r\nEna Luz is now the mother of 5 children aged between 6 to 21 years.  Three of them live in another town with their grandparents.  She dreams of them all achieving success and being able to study and become professionals.  Ena therefore directs all her efforts to make this happen through daily hard work, and she is supported in this by her husband who works as a janitor at a construction firm. \r\n\r\nThis is the first funding she has received from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy non-perishable products such as rice, oil, grain and beer at wholesale.  This is an investment that promises to be successful, not only because of the experience of the entrepreneur in these activities but also because the season is about to become more cheerful with fun in the city from The Carnival of Barranquilla, where \"everything is for sale\", especially those products Ena prepares for festivals and for the local celebrations that take place with families in their communities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":731094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is a happy sales person, and she treats the people who come to buy a sweet very well.  What she likes best about her work is talking with her neighboring vendors; she always makes them laugh a lot.  What she likes least is staying all day at her stall and enduring the burning sun.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They are her greatest treasure, and she wishes to help them with the various family expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe delivers newspapers, which is one of the most difficult jobs in the city.  People are on the streets very early wanting to stay informed of the latest events.  She distributes the papers to her customers at the optimal time whenever possible.  To achieve her sales record of these papers, she gets up at dawn to go the newspaper agencies to get papers to distribute to stores and stalls in the markets.\r\n\r\nHer routine is to distribute in the mornings and collect in the afternoons.  She has been doing this for 20 years.  In that time she has gained experience, and she has a great number of customers who are used to visits from Eusebia.\r\n\r\nHer next goal is to set up a stall in the regional market to sell food products as an additional business, which she is used to.\r\n\r\nShe needs help to have greater income in order to give her elderly parents security.  This is her seventh loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She has shown herself to be a person who does well in making her payments.\r\n\r\nEusebia likes the enthusiasm her work team has.  It is one of the characteristics of the community bank, which has 16 members, that pleases her.  The 2,200 PEN that she is asking for is to buy more newspapers in order to increase customers in her region.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":379551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":367},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":365}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.11},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":370.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081280},{"amount":125.12,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":370.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997431},{"amount":125.11,"local_amount":367,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":370.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842776},{"amount":374.66,"local_amount":1099,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734353}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T19:04:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":137509,"name":"Caracol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u201cCaracol\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Gladis y conformado por 14 miembros los cuales can cursando su primer ciclo, en general los socios del grupo se dedican a actividades comerciales entre las que se pueden mencionar a la venta D. pan, gelatina, ropa, comida, empanadas y a actividades como la costura, alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, enfermer\u00eda y al servicio D. transporte p\u00fablico.

Inauawan, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling food, running  a general store and raising pigs. Her husband Danilo, who is 48 years old, works as a delivery truck driver and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children between seven and 23. \r\n\r\nAdamia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adamia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use for the maintenance of her general store and as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and their daily needs. Adamia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

The Flavio family raises cattle and he says that it is a family business.\r\n\r\nFlavio has 6 cows and a plot of land where they feed; the land is leased to graze the cows. Before breeding livestock, he was a farmer and worked as a labourer which wasn't very profitable. This is why he changed to breeding and cattle trade. \r\n\r\nHe buys the livestock at 'tiangues' (a place where animals are sold), in an area 2 kms from the canton to the city. When he buys the cows at the flea markets he takes them home herding down the street.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be invested in buying 2 cows and materials for construction to continue building his house such 15 bags of cement, 10 quintals of iron, 1 truckload of sand & 300 bricks. With buying 2 dairy cows, his milk production will be greater and more milk will be available to sell. In this way, he will satisfy the current demand for milk and receive a better income which will allow him to improve his standard of living.\r\n\r\nFlavio hopes to continue building his brick house as the one he currently has is made of laminate and wooden boards. He also hopes to continue breeding livestock and expand this business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":912904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 2 cows and materials for construction such 15 bags of cement, 10 quintals of iron, 1 truckload of sand & 300 bricks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.91,"local_amount":65.91,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":65.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773911},{"amount":57.18,"local_amount":57.18,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":57.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317655},{"amount":105.52,"local_amount":105.52,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-26T08:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":105.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736428},{"amount":771.39,"local_amount":771.39,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":771.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315383113}],"funded_date":"2011-12-25T19:38:02Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:08:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":359623,"name":"Julius Ngethe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius is a 27-year-old married man.

Here, too, there are many very delicious typical dishes and, above all, the residents are very nice and hospitable people. Nicolas is a very charismatic person, and that is how he came to capture his wife, with whom he has 2 children, ages 5 and 10. Nicolas loves his little ones and for that reason, he works every day to provide them with a worthy life and, above all, to lead them to become good persons.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age Nicolas learned to work, all the more because his parents had scarce economic resources. For that reason, he could only study to the 5th grade of secondary school. But he managed to complete a course in cabinetmaking and carpentry, thanks to which he was able to launch his business, a shop for woodworking, repair and selling wood furniture. He also makes musical instruments, among other things. Nicolas arises very early in the morning to open his business and works over 10 hours per day. He believes that his business is advancing because he treats his customers well and always offers attractive designs and good finished products. \r\n\r\nNicolas is very grateful to Kiva investors. Thanks to the help they have offered, he is able to buy materials to make improvements to his home. For that purpose, he now wishes to buy corrugated iron sheets and nails, among other things. In this manner, he will make his home more secure and can offer a better quality of life to his family. Thus, he will continue struggling to make his grand dream become a reality: \u201cTo give a good education to his children and to have the largest shop in his

They have two handsome sons and now they are building a wooden house. Her parents did agricultural work for a living, which was their only source of income. The years passed and Eva fell in love with a very hardworking and responsible farmer. In the time they have been together, they have proposed goals to advance and develop in the competitive market. They work in the business of buying and selling fruit. Her husband plants citrus fruits and sometimes he buys fruit from their neighbors. Buying from small farms is convenient for them, since it is less of an investment. They invest 1000 soles in citrus fruits and their earnings are 600 (soles), discounting all expenses. What they also do is buy green plantains and by using a liquid called Etrel, the plantains mature before their time. This investment costs 3 soles, and it is very profitable as well. Eva is another client who is very timely with her payments, and she is also a very active member of her communal bank. She participates in all activities that the loan analysts do, and she is always is ready to lend a hand. She plans to invest the money she's requesting by purchasing a fruit truck that she will later send to the market in Lima. Meanwhile, she is going to send the load of plantains to her city market until conditions for selling this fruit at the main square in Lima improve.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":256558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a fruit truck","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T03:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:30Z","rounded_local_amount":511.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116904},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":511.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595419},{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1023.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989661}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T06:34:50Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tara Binetti","image":null}},{"id":88322,"name":"Adelfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelfa E. is a scrap buyer.

For 3 years she has been selling livestock, both for meat and for wool; depending on the type of animal, she tries to get the greatest benefit in order to have the best possible earnings.  In addition, in the morning she sells candies during snack time in the cafeteria of a private school near her house, which permits Elizabeth to have additional income to cover the educational expenses of her 5 children.  Occasionally her older children help her, since her husband works far away; nevertheless, this type of work has been able to cover the financial needs.  In the future she would like to have enough land to raise her animals, rather than on the patio of her house.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan through MFP.  She is one of the most engaged members of her communal bank, being very dynamic and driven by responsibility to her group, which is why she has assumed the position of treasurer.

He will then continue to generate greater income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":320088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Legalize his vehicle by changing the engine and be able to make his work easier","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.4,"local_amount":451.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":485.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112239},{"amount":25.24,"local_amount":448.71,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":482.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533642},{"amount":25.22,"local_amount":448.37,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":482.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965001},{"amount":25.33,"local_amount":450.29,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":484.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875457},{"amount":23.81,"local_amount":423.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":455.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713386},{"amount":26.25,"local_amount":466.58,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":501.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601084},{"amount":25.17,"local_amount":447.43,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":481.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002557},{"amount":25.23,"local_amount":448.48,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":482.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840722},{"amount":23.35,"local_amount":415.31,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":446.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873658}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T17:03:45Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":112898,"name":"Clarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Clarita C. is the mother of four children: Denver, Christian, Welbor and Maribel, and they live in Sta.

Due to the distances she has to cover this task takes all day during the weekends.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, Maribel is planning to open a shop in her house.  Since her customers are acquainted with her home this motivated her to establish a shop where she offers diverse products such as clothing and household articles which she hopes to obtain soon.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has already had 13 loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  These have allowed her to improve her quality of life.  Furthermore, her community bank has offered a good opportunity for economic, social, and personal development to her and her friends.

The competition in these areas is strong, and they know that they must continue to move forward in their respective businesses.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase merchandise, supplies and tools to assist in the growth of these businesses so that the borrowers can increase their incomes and give their families a better quality of life.  As far as credit experience, these members are in their first cycle with the institution, but they are happy that it is providing them economic support that will help them to generate better incomes and a better quality of life for their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

She lives in the Rivera neighborhood of Chill\u00f3n, a new and prosperous area. She tells us that at first there were few businesses in the area, and she was one of the first to open an Internet caf\u00e9. Since that service had not previously existed in the neighborhood, and her business was the only one, she attracted many customers. Later, even though competition arose, she was able to maintain her success through hard work, dedication and excellent service that kept customers coming back to her business. At the same time, she also ventured into the minimarket business and has recently started a company.\r\n\r\nWhat fascinates her most is the field of food service, which she considers her specialty. She prepares food for events and activities; she is well-known in this field and receives many contracts. In the future, she would like to formalize this business and create a brand and patent. She receives much support from EDAPROSPO; she will always remember the time when she was walking through the market and found a poster that had been tossed on the ground which talked about the loans offered by EDAPROSPO, and she decided to form her group with friends from the neighborhood. She believes that the loans she has received have helped her improve her business, since with the profits she was able to purchase display cases and equipment to enhance it. She will use the current loan to buy merchandise for her minimarket; she knows that the Christmas holidays are approaching and the sales volume  will be high. \r\n\r\n*In the photo, on the right-hand siD., two passive partners appear as guests; Dolivethy is standing up and is the fourth from the right.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4425,"image":{"id":438415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying merchandise for her minimarket","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T14:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4425,"lender_count":128,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolivethy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madeleine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janina Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilly Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2132},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2132},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2132},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2132},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2132},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2140}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":737.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":737.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":737.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":739.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":737.04,"local_amount":2132,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669127},{"amount":737.04,"local_amount":2132,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064591},{"amount":737.04,"local_amount":2132,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899651},{"amount":737.04,"local_amount":2132,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933733},{"amount":737.04,"local_amount":2132,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2137.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661331},{"amount":739.8,"local_amount":2140,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2145.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694023}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T09:17:10Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":162315,"name":"Akomola","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"En 2006, ce monsieur a commenc\u00e9 le commerce en d\u00e9tail des gaz et des accessoires de gaz, il s\u2019approvisionne au mali, au Ghana et au burkina.

For the last two years he has sold gasoline from his home.  He began this work because the earnings he made from working as a field hand were not enough to meet family expenses.  Gasoline is very useful in the area where he lives, above all for irrigation of farmlands, because the great majority of fields do not have irrigation canals and the crops must be watered with water that is extracted from wells by motors.  He also works as an agricultural field hand.  Roman is aware that he must exhert the greatest effort daily if he is to support his family so he gives his all to the tasks he does.  He is asking Edpyme Alternativa for 1500 new soles to be used to enlarge his gasoline-sales business.  His greatest wish is to provide his children with the possibility to study some kind of a professional career when they finish secondary school.

It is a small rural community.  The residents engage in milk production and farming, primarily growing coffee and bananas.  They also dedicate much of their time to raising pigs.  The area consists of hilly terrain and much of the land is maintained as a tropical rain forest.\r\n<p>\r\nDon Michael has been growing papaya for two years.  He says he has sufficient experience in caring for and maintaining this type of crop.  Michael has a small plot of land where he grows papaya.  His previous crops resulted in good sales, so he wants to expand his farm.  Thanks to this business, the quality of life for his family has improved considerably.  \r\n<p>\r\nMichael is currently requesting a micro-loan of 605,000 CRC in order to buy fertilizers, seeds, and other needed supplies so that he can plant a hectare of papaya and maintain his land to achieve the best results possible.  In the end, he hopes to be rewarded with a very good harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nDon Michael is a member of the Ramonenses Association of Agricultural Producers, one of 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

To making a living, T. owns and operates a business venture selling rice products in the local community.  Engaged in this business for over 12 years, she earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having repaid her previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA that was used to purchase additional products to sell, she is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  This will be T.'s fourth loan from SEDA, and she  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her enterprise.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:<p>\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She supports her family by operating 2 business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a tricycle operator business. She lives in Purok Maabi-abihon, Brgy Balintawak, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store and tricycle operator businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6000. Maribelle is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Maribelle aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by vegetable farming. Her husband Theodoro, who is 43 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 15 to 25 years old. Marcosa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marcosa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 16,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Marcosa C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is divorced and has three sons: two are working in South Africa and one is living with her in the capital city Maputo and has just concluded high school.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria Helena was raised by her grandparents. She studied until 7th grade and stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. Maria Helena started to work quite young: at 17 years old she got a job at an agriculture company, where she worked for four years. For some years Maria Helena worked at a small stand in the street selling basic needs products to help support her children. In 1999 she started to go to South Africa to buy products to sell in Mozambique. She first started selling cooking oil, but then changed to plastic bags and chicken paws.\r\n<p>\r\nThe most productive selling period is between April and October. Her monthly profit is around MTn 4,000, and Maria Helena uses this money to support her family, including her younger son\u2019s education. Maria Helena does not have a store, she delivers the merchandise to her clients' houses or stores.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Maria Helena\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku. The first loan of MTn 10,000 was used to buy merchandise in South Africa and Maria Helena paid it back without difficulties. This MTn 16,000 loan will also be used to increase inventory, more specifically to buy plastic bags and chicken paws. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Maria Helena would like to build a small market where she

She is 40 years old. Perlita is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Perlita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Perlita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Perlita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Perlita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Quingeo is a parish located an hour and a half outside the Cuenca city, a location with beautiful landscape, lush vegetation, and enviable flora and fauna. Quingeo's most well-known festivals include Carnaval, because of its various events including the Capul\u00ed Queen's event and many more.  It is one of the most beautiful areas outside of Cuenca city. \r\n\r\nAll of the members of Quingeo Communal Bank migrated to their current location from the city, in search of better days for their families.\r\n\r\nManuela Q. V. is a Quingeo parish native, and she is a member of the Communal Bank of the same name.  She migrated to the area from Cuenca city two years ago to find a better future for her family.  She lives in the open market sector.  Manuela is 49 years old, she is married, and has 8 children.  She does not remember the ages of her two oldest children, but they are both married and live with their respective families.  She also has two young children, 9 and 6 years old, who live with her at home in Quingeo and their older sister takes care of them.  The children also live in a rented home with Manuela's husband in the city, because he works in a small kiosk that he owns and with which he helps pay for the expenses they have at home.\r\n\r\nManuela has been selling vegetables in the open market for two years now and it has gone very well, especially on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays when she gets her vegetable deliveries and resells them all around the market.  She is happy because Cuenca municipality has helped her obtain a post inside the market so she can work from one place and she no longer has to walk around anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and one of her friends introduced her to the group because she too had improved her economic situation through a loan.  This loan that FUNDACION ESPOIR is giving Manuela will be invested in the purchase of her market stall and everything else her new stall needs, as well as toward the purchasing of more vegetables for her business.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to eventually cultivate all of land, because at the moment it has been neglected while she builds up her vegetable stall in the market.\r\n\r\nRosario Del Cisne B. is another member of Quingeo Communal Bank, and she migrated from her native Quingeo parish to settle in Cuenca city 18 years ago.  Rosario is 31 years old and recently married, but she has been living with her partner for over 12 years now and they have three children who are 9, 7, and 2 years old.  They do not have their own home yet so they rent, and her husband is a bricklayer.  They each help their family, and when her husband cannot find work, he helps her with her business.\r\n\r\nRosario sells vegetables, grains, onions, and more in the open market.  She has been selling goods since she was young, and she thanks God that her business has done well.  She sells the most on Saturdays and Sundays, but regardless, every day she sells from 6am to 6pm, and days when she does traveling sales to markets farther away, she leaves at 4am so that she can claim a stall in those markets.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosario's first loan, and a friend invited her to be part of the group.  With the money FUNDACION ESPOIR is giving her, she will invest in the purchase of her own permanent stall in the market as well as buying more grain and growing her business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to save enough money to buy her own car or plot of land.\r\n\r\nCarmen Rosa D. M. is also a member of Quingeo Communal Bank, and she lives on an old street called Ba\u00f1os in the urban area of Cuenca.  Carmen is 22 years old, she lives with her partner, and they have one daughter who is 3 years old.  She is currently 8 months pregnant with their second child, but they do not yet know the sex yet.  She does not have her own home, so she rents.  She has a great relationship with her spouse, who works with scrap metal and helps her pay for all of their household expenses.\r\n\r\nCarmen works as a server in a restaurant inside the open market; she has been doing this for four years, and it has gone very well for her because she has great bosses who have special affection for her.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with FUNDACION ESPOIR; a friend recently invited her to become part of the group and enjoy the benefits that the institution gives their members.\r\n\r\nThe loan that FUNDACION ESPOIR is giving Carmen is going to be used to cover her birth-related expenses, and her dream is to eventually own her own restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzy Marinkovich, Kiva

Although he likes what he does, he is affected by the expensive materials used in bee-keeping as well as the limited market for the honey made from it.

However, he thinks that it is time to take a step forward and expand the business. Currently he needs a loan for 605,000 colones to buy more goods to sell, make his business bigger, and offer better service to his neighbors and the tourists that pass through the area.

Many of Kadie\u2019s customers live in rural areas. Working seven days a week and 11 hours a day, Kadie earns about 2,930,000 SLL every month from her business.

Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family needs.

The animals are raised and cared for until the reach the appropriate size and weight to be sold in local markets or to neighbors.  Peru has a rich cultural tradition and many special dishes using farm-raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to raising animals, Jose works as a farm hand earning approximately $9.00 a day.

is a weaver, making traditional Mayan clothes for women of her village. The special women\u2019s top she weaves is called a huipil, the most important part of the Maya woman's outfit.  The weave, design and style of each huipil is indicative of the village it is from and is worn with great pride. Ana has no formal education and speaks only Cakchiquel, but is a master weaver with great knowledge of this ancient Guatemalan art. The women\u2019s credit group she belongs to is called \u201cQuetzal\u201d, which is also the name of the currency used in Guatemala.  She has taken out 3 loans in the past year and a half, and she has successfully  repaid each loan.. With this new loan she will purchase new thread and materials to continue weaving.Ana is 40 years old and married. Her husband works as a night watchman  in a nearby town. Together they have raised 4 children, own their own home,  and are now helping raise their five grandchildren. Her goals are simple: to be able to buy more material to weave more and sell the resulting products.

Rachel started her business in the year 2002 and at this time, she operated her business from her house. She used to make tablecloths which she sold in the town of Meru, in the Eastern Province of Kenya. Rachel continued selling her tablecloths in Meru town until the year 2004 when she decided to introduce a new line into her business, by selling ladies suits after two ladies in Meru town commissioned her to make them suits. She made six additional suits to test the market and to her surprise, all the six were sold very quickly. From then on, Rachel decided to become a full time tailor specializing in ladies clothes.\r\n\r\nRachael has managed to employ several orphaned young women who help her with the tailoring work. Rachel now intends to expand her business by stocking tailoring materials and accessories so that her tailoring colleagues and customers do not have to travel all the way to the city center to buy these items. Rachel is therefore requesting a loan of USD750 that she intends to repay within 12 months. With this loan, Rachael will be able to boost her income by supplying tailoring materials and accessories such as lining, buttons, rings, canvas, thread biers and laces.

This is 45 year old Colleta K. from Mwanza. She is a widow with one child, who is 30 years old. She is also responsible for supporting two dependants who are orphans. Colleta K. has been running a clothes business since 2007 and her business is dong well. She works at her business 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. Colleta K. currently earns about 250USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 500USD in order to purchase more clothes for resale. In the future, she plans to add more supplies of clothes. Colleta thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Colleta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436435},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130707},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027504},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613505},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010584},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232874},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664675},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105406},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022551},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867800}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T15:19:54Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":88354,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Flora D. is currently in the business of selling perfume at the market street.

She lives in a rented house with her four children: Jessica (16), Ver\u00f3nica (10), Zeus (6) and Carlos (5), who are the motivation behind all her endeavours. Her stall is located in the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca), where she sells runners which she brings from the city of Desaguadero (a district of the Puno department, on the border with the country of Bolivia). Her stall is very popular as the models she brings are new, original and inexpensive. What she likes most about her work is to sell, and she is very happy when she sells all her merchandise. She has spent five years in this line of work and she considers the most difficult aspect to be transporting the runners, as the boxes she has to carry are very heavy and they tire her out a lot. In the future she hopes to have a shoe store from where she can sell in greater comfort. \r\n\r\nThis is Ventura\u00b4s fourth loan with MFP and she expects to be able to pay all her installments on time just as she did with her earlier payments.

who was born in 1975, is married to Mr. Napoleon and has six children, four of whom are younger than 15. They all live in a three-room apartment in the Tumuku Belo subdivision. Irine was having difficulties in life so a friend took her to GHAPE in 2009, and she received a loan of 50,000 XAF which she used to buy and sell Irish potatoes and beans, leading her to success in life.\r\n \r\nSince Irine had a lot of success, she needs to expand. Therefore, she is applying for a second loan to buy more beans and potatoes and to add goats. She knows that she will succeed since she succeeded with the first loan and more people are demanding her goods. Irine is really helping the community since she has reduced people's distance to the market and the goods are in constant supply. Deaths have been the only challenge Irine has faced in life. The profit from this loan will help her expand her business and keep up her family's welfare. The training, the gradual repayment of loans and the low interest rates are the reasons that Irine prefers loans from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":789752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

In el Para\u00edso, they just got access to the electric grid in early 2012, however the service is extremely unreliable. They continue to rely on candles when the lights go out.They mention that due to their geographical conditions, sometimes rains can last up to 8 days and there are black-outs during the rains. They believe a solar system will have great value through savings on their energy costs and will eliminate the need for the use of candles in their homes. Additionally, it can prevent them from running out of battery on their cell-phones and have no way of communicating with the nearby centers. \n\nMarciano works weaving hammocks which he then sells in the nearby touristic centers.

am Mussarat B. .I am married and I live in a small rented house with my husband and eight children. My husband works at a local steel factory for a meager income. We were making very hard to manage our living in such a scanty pay.  In order to increase the household income my son started a used clothing business, a couple of years ago with the loan we took from Asasah, a microfinance institution. The business is flourishing slowly since then and has enabled us to uplift our financial status substantially.

He is married with 3 children. Munavvarkul lives in Istaravshan, Tajikistan and has two hectares of land on which he cultivates cereals and vegetables. His wife and elder son help him on the plantation. \r\n<p>\r\nHe now faces a small problem because he does not have enough money to buy seeds to plant onions and wheat. Therefore, he has decided to ask for a loan. He will also buy fertilizers and hire some workers to cultivate his field. You could become an important part of his family's life. Munavvarkul deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business is located in the Colonia Jose Angel Ulloa, and right now she counts on steady customers.  She started the business two years ago and little by little her business has become secure with the help of her husband who works as a security guard.  They have two children.  She goes twice a week to the market to buy merchandise at a much lower price.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Roselyn is now requesting another loan, this time in the amount of 50,000 PHP ($1,100), which will be used to buy housing materials for some much-needed home improvement work.

It is made up of six members who are neighbors and acquaintances: Se\u00f1ora Antonia A. T. who is going to buy organic and chemical fertilizers to fertilize her nopal (prickly pear cactus); Se\u00f1ora Lilia O. F. who is going to buy goods for her business, including sugar, eggs by the kilo, sodas, cookies and cheese; Se\u00f1ora Aurelia F. Z. who is going to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her nopal; Se\u00f1or Alberto M. P. who is going to buy compost to fertilize his nopal so that it produces more; Se\u00f1ora Brizaida F. Rodr\u00edguez who is going to buy organic fertilizer to fertilize her nopal in order to increase its produce; and Se\u00f1ora Irma L. C. who will buy fertilizer and organic compost for her nopal. \n\nSe\u00f1ora Lilia O. F. is the group's representative. She is 39 years old and she graduated third year of secondary school. She is married and has two children: Ernesto David who is eight years old and is in the third year of primary school, and Deiry Mariana who is nine years old and in the fourth year. \n\nSe\u00f1ora Lilia has a grocery store and is requesting a loan to stock up her store. She is going to buy coffee, candy, eggs, sugar, soft drinks, juices, cookies, cheese, yogurt, cream, toilet paper, etc. She started her business four years ago. Her brother had a small store, so he lent it to her and took her to the market to buy basic goods. Bit by bit, the business has grown through loans. \n\nHer business is important to her because it provides food for her children and allows them to get on in life. Her favorite part of the business is providing pleasant service to her customers and she is proud to have made this business successful. At first she didn't think she would be able to do it, but she did it. She remembers when they plastered the walls and tiled the floor to make the store look better. Her clientele consists of women and children, and her business is popular due to the good treatment received by customers. The challenges facing the business are high costs, and when costs are high she has less stock. She uses any profit to reinvest in the business and to buy food and pay other small expenses. \n\nSe\u00f1ora Lilia wants to expand her business to sell other goods such as stationery, light bulbs and electrical accessories, and she intends to achieve this with loans from Kiva  and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidadand (Kiva Field Partner). Her children help out in the store: her daughter serves customers and her puts the soft drinks in the refrigerator. Tlalnepantla is a nice quiet place. The landscape has many trees and hills, and you can see the Popocatepetl and Iztlaccihuatl volcanos. \n\nHer business has helped feed her family. Her husband has extended the house and they have a car. She would like to make improvements to the house such as plastering the living room and building a well. Her hopes and dreams are to grow her store, improve her standard of living and save for her old age. She is happy with this loan because it will allow her to increase her business and buy more stock. For her children's future, she hopes that they continue their studies and have a career, and that they live happily and in harmony. She intends to achieve this by increasing her profits and continuing to pay for their studies. \n\nMembers of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \"Thank you very much for the loans you provide us with. Thanks to you, we can move forward.\"\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":710613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy eggs, sugar, soft drinks, coffee, candies, juices, cookies, cheese, yogurt, cream and toilet paper","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLANEPANTLA MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-02-17T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Brizaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":217.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":217.5,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2620.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850162},{"amount":435,"local_amount":5200,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5240.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292436},{"amount":652.5,"local_amount":7800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7861,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160694},{"amount":502.05,"local_amount":6001.54,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6048.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233568},{"amount":367.95,"local_amount":4398.46,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4432.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512402}],"funded_date":"2011-02-18T05:32:53Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":277691,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Bertha Abarca G.

The work to which she dedicates herself is farming, an activity which her family has traditionally carried out. Today, her focus is working the land to make it productive. She grows cacao, coffee and plantains, products which are sold wholesale at the agricultural warehouses of the city of San Francisco. She has used the earnings she obtains to pay the expenses of her household and to pay for her children's education. For this reason, she is putting all of her efforts into continuing with this work. She has 15 years of experience, and up to this moment it has been difficult for her to transport her products from the farm to her community, since the distance is one hour's walk. In the future, she wants to buy more land to expand her farm. This will be her 15th loan with MFP, and she hopes to benefit once again with the help of all of you to continue making progress.
