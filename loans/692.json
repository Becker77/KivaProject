With this, they can generate more earnings, allowing them to save so they can rent more comfortable dwellings for their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":208895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase raw materials (thread, cloth, etc.) to increase their production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto \/ La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2008-10-14T16:40:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salustiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T01:47:02Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10202.01,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1700.34},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1700.34},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1700.34},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1700.34},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1700.34},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1700.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":1700.34,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-07T08:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345449},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":1700.34,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9967986},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":1700.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-01T09:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884402},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":1700.34,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433850},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":1700.34,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-26T08:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128244},{"amount":245.85,"local_amount":1700.31,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025118}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T01:47:02Z","paid_date":"2009-05-20T08:33:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":71614,"name":"Jina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jina has been selling dresses and fabric in Zanzibar for one year.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of tailoring equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T04:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":117687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436382},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":117687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130654},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":117687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027451},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":117687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613452},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":117687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010532},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":117687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232828}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T09:57:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":87998,"name":"Armida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Armida A.

They live in the Bamanan district of Sako\u00efba (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  The women know one another through ties of kinship, marriage, and community, and they have revenue-generating businesses involving a variety of goods.  After five group loans, all repaid without difficulty, they are on their sixth solidarity loan.  This new loan will be used to buy 30 cart-loads of firewood, 27 sacks of charcoal, 3 sacks of peanuts, and a dozen plastic buckets in which to put peanut butter.\r\n\r\nSupplies of firewood and charcoal are gotten locally, furnished by producers from Zenguela, Soign\u00e9bougou, Ouassila, Siradoba, and Bougounina.  Supplies of peanuts are gotten at the big market of S\u00e9gou (at the weekly fairs).  Sales are made at the retail level in cash or on credit to customers composed of women and men generally in S\u00e9gou from a fixed spot at the weekly fairs in S\u00e9gou City.  On ordinary days, sales are made from place to place.  \r\n\r\nThe group members hope to realize an average monthly profit of 23,000 francs CFA that will be used to meet certain family needs, to repay the loan interest, and to assist at societal events.

He now earns his income selling milk, tea, and maize. He says that lately the main challenges to his business are poor seeds, lack of water from drought and lack of sufficient feed for his livestock.\r\n\r\nJonah has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, previously completing a loan of 45,000 KES. He has now requested this loan for 60,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow and improve his overall farm activities. He says that with a good quality dairy cow he can produce enough milk to easily repay the loan and pay his children's school fees.\r\n\r\nHis main goal for the future is to purchase land and build a modern house for his family.

This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital.

They work hard every day to get ahead.  Since she was very young, this dedicated woman has worked at selling various products and for the last seven years she has been selling natural products and cleaning supplies.  She works from Monday to Friday, during her free time, and she is doing very well because her brother makes the cleaning products and she is able to get them very cheaply and can this way make good profits from her sales.  She likes to sell the natural herbs, which she buys from a wholesaler, because she know that they offer many curative benefits. Her days are quiet, between the care of her children and her work which does not take too much of her time.

She\u2019s worked hard every day to support her children because for many years now since her divorce from her husband she\u2019s been in the fast food business, an activity that has helped her support her children and provide them with education.  She has three children.  Two of them work and help her with household expenses and she still has one in school.  She works hard to provide a career for him so that he will have better opportunities in the future.\r\n\r\nShe has a small business located downtown where she sells fast food like: sopes, tostadas, enchiladas and quesadillas.  She requested the loan to buy more ingredients to make the dishes like: tomatoes, chilies, onion, cheese, chicken and beef, among others, since these are the main ingredients.\r\n\r\nShe comments that she\u2019s doing well in the business currently.  She has several customers since most of the population knows that her dishes are very tasty.  Besides, the place she\u2019s located at has a lot of foot traffic.  The challenge she faces is competition because there are several food stands nearby but she isn\u2019t concerned about that because she says: \u201cGod provides for everyone\u201d and \u201cthe sun rises for all.\u201d  She thanks God because she\u2019s never lacked food and He has always given her strength to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMinerva comments that her greatest wish is to remodel her house and this is why she\u2019s saving up a little from her profits to start making this dream come true.\r\n\r\nAll the group members are grateful for the loan provided because, thanks to it, they will be able to invest more in their businesses and obtain higher profits to meet their family

He was born on July 21, 1974 in Kpalim\u00e9 and is responsible for two dependents besides his immediate family. Born into a very poor family, he had to leave school after 6th grade and decided to begin an apprenticeship. After about 8 years he became a master at his trade and tried his best to figure out how to get a workshop. Since he has not managed to find a way for his wife to engage in retail business, he is the sole breadwinner for his family. He encounters many difficulties in his work, such as lack of the necessary machines, no way to fix up his workshop, and even lack of metal to work with. These problems have made him decide to ask for a loan of US$ 400 for his business. This will allow him to expand his business activities into other spheres and thus better support his family by increasing his income. <P> <B> Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/B>Mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re d\u2019un (01) enfant, Mr K.

They are all engaged in food service due to the location of their village at a much-travelled crossroads. This loan will be used to buy sacks of rice, buckets of peanut butter, and other necessary ingredients for preparing their dishes. The sales are made out of open sheds along the road that passes through the village to a clientele consisting of travelers, transporters, drivers, and village people.

With income from her business, Florence is able to support all of her children in junior high school. <p>\r\n\r\nHer major business challenge over the years is her lack of funding, which prevents her from scaling up the business. She has a great deal of marketing experience, so she is very confident that she can improve the business with an injection of capital. As such, she is seeking a loan to enable her to achieve remarkable business progress. Specifically, she would use the loan proceeds to buy more bales of used clothes to meet her customers' demands.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She lives in her own house with her husband, Epifanio, who is 38, and her daughter, Maria, who is 18.  Maria wants to give them a good life.\r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s business is carpentry.  She has been in this business with her husband for over ten years.  They make beds, tables, and chairs, etc.  They distribute them to the furniture sellers in the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  Their work is of a very good quality, and the finishings they put on the furniture makes it sell very quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her business is transforming the wood into things that people can use.  The most difficult thing for her is transporting the wood to her house.  This makes her very tired.  Even so, Melania wants to continue her business.  She strives to set up her own furniture store where she can sell her own work.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She is prepared to make all of her payments on time.  She does not want to cause problems for the members of her community bank, where she is well liked for her contagious joy.  With the 1,000 PEN that she is asking for, she will buy more wood to make a greater quantity of furniture to increase her income.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":339033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Buy wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-22T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990786},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211911},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641439},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080878},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997019},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":174.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842358}],"funded_date":"2009-06-23T05:15:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":120782,"name":"Bron","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The two persons shown in the above photo are Mrs. Bron S. and her husband, and they both live in Siem Reap Province.\r\n\r\nBron S. cultivates rice and vegetable crops to earn a living.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Esterlita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 7,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Esterlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Esterlita is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Esterlita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She makes sure that she earns so that her family can have a better life. She has been managing her health care product business for 12 years now.\r\n\r\nGrace has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues, because she uses the money she borrowed to expand and improve her health care product business. \r\n\r\nTo continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 40,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of additional capital for her expanding business by buying additional quantities of health care products, as well as incorporating more varieties of products into her inventory.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can have enough money for her adopted child\u2019s future.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

She is married and has four children, ages 5, 10, 12, and 20. All of her children attend school. She has one additional dependent who lives with her: her niece. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Kalaytu established her business doing tailoring and selling football game materials. She gained business experience from her husband; since he is a business man, he coached her on how to run her business. He gave her some starting capital to begin her business. Working six days a week and nine hours a day, she earns about 1,140,000 SLL every month from this business. She would like a loan of 5,000,000 SLL. Kalaytu  has already received and successfully repaid one loan. She will use the new loan to buy wool thread (20 bundles @ 30,000 SLL), footballs (5 doz @ 60,000 SLL), padlocks (20 doz @ 7,000 SLL), and nylon thread (10 bundles @ 30,000 SLL). She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 225,000 SLL.  \r\n\r\nKalaytu is quite sure that this money will help her improve her business gradually. In the future, she plans to educate her children to the university level with the support of her husband. She wants her children to be able to take care of them when they retire. \r\n\r\nThe rainy season is a threat to her business. Competition is average, but she normally overcomes her competitors due to her customer service. She serves the entire Makeni community. Her suppliers are located at Guinea Conakry and Freetown, where she travels by vehicle twice a week.

He is married and has one child. He also takes care of two of her sister\u2019s children, Millicent 18 years and Nelly 17 years, both in high school. He assists in paying their school fees. The sister succumbed to illness in the year 2004. She was not legally married.\r\n\r\nCharles only managed to get education up to high school level. Due to the increased unemployment in Kenya and lack of fees for college, he only managed to get a casual job in the juakali sector. Through this he learned various skills, including the spraying of cars. He worked in the garage for seven years. All this time he had been saving a bit of the little money he got as wages. It is while working at the garage that he together with his colleagues came up with the idea of opening their own garage. With their little saving and their varied skills, they managed to buy simple basic tools to start up. It is then that they opened Walsam garage at a road reserve near Fort Jesus in Kibera slums. They have been operating there for the last three years.\r\n\r\nCharles and his friends have had constraints in their tools at work. They have no spraying machine at the garage. They are forced to hire a machine at a cost of USD 7 for every vehicle they spray. Besides that, they have to book the machine a day in advance. Sometimes they do not get the machine, which forces the vehicles to stay longer at the garage, which often results in loss of business.

She produces between 30 to 35 cheeses a day. <p>\r\nWith the loan of S\/. 2,000.00, which she will repay in 6 months, she will buy a new refrigerator, since the one she currently has is no longer in good condition. This piece of equipment is vital to her business for the proper storage of her cheese. <p>\r\nRosa is 42 years of age and has 2 children. She learned cheesemaking at a young age from her parents. Now, she is putting her skills to use. Her desire is to set up a business space next year so that she can make her cheese because she is doing it from home for now. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Rosa  C.

Further down the road, he plans to buy more agricultural land to plant corn in large quantities. Likewise, he wishes to become a successful merchant of fruits and other edible products.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.

This man has been a farmer for more than 5 years. Together with his family he grows diverse products such as cucumbers, onions, wheat, barley and other vegetables. What pleases him is sowing his diverse crops as it is profitable to invest in a variety of vegetables and sell his harvest monthly, according to market demand. But the most tedious part is having to clear his land and take care of his crops day after day. This is his first loan with IMON International and he is promising to repay the loan ion time, not letting down anyone. Nasirullo will invest the money in purchasing seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. \r\n\r\n More about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her previous loan of PHP 13,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. \r\n\r\n Carmen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has taken advantage of her first Kiva loan and has been a reliable client paying on time. Today, she is requesting to borrow $1,500 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase more beauty products and new hairdressing tools and supplies.

She resides in the small town of Aravan in the south of the republic. For the past 15 years, her daily routine has consisted of feeding and watering the cattle, taking it on high pastures to get sun and fresh air and then back to the shed. Cattle breeding is not Muyassarkhan's only activity; she has also graduated with a degree in medicine and has been working in this sphere for almost two decades. Since the monthly income of medical personnel is only 7,000 soms, Muyassarkhan attempted to find an additional source of income. She invested 5,000 soms of family savings to purchase her very first heads of cattle. She did her best to promote the business and soon, thanks to generated profits, she managed to make repairs to her house and expand her herd. Cattle breeding and resale take much time and energy and brings 4,000 soms monthly. Muyassarkhan has many plans for the future, including providing college education for three of her children and opening a grocery store and a small pharmacy. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

She has a husband and two adult daughters.  Galina is involved in selling spare parts for agricultural machinery.  Her husband actively helps her with this business because he knows machinery very well.  They have been working in this field for 11 years.  Galina plans to invest money, received from Kiva, into a purchase of a land plot for a store.  She has already reached an agreement with the village council to purchase the land and plans to complete this transaction prior to the New Year's, while the laws remain unchanged.  The land, that Galina wants to purchase, is located in the center of Znamenka, right across from the market, with practically all village stores surrounding it.  There, Galina and her husband plan to continue selling auto parts for farm machinery, but also want to build a small kiosk nearby to sell food products.  Galina hopes that this deal will happen, and that the land will belong to them because then they would not longer have to pay for a large lease, and no one would be able to take away their land or force them out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":963886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

He uses the yield he produces from his farm to take care of his family of 10.  Jamilu has been farming from a very young age and although he has years of experience, his inability to access the right inputs such as high-quality seeds and fertilizers has seen years of below average yields from his maize farm.  A Babban Gona loan of $485 would help Jamilu see improvements in his crops by providing him with seeds and fertilizers while allowing him the means to store his crops and the ability to sell them at a premium market price.  By receiving a Babban Gona loan, Jamilu has the opportunity to reap yields and earn profits three times as high as the average Nigerian farmer.\n\nWith the technical training he has received from Babban Gona, Jamilu can envision a future where he is better able to provide for his large family.  He has the chance to see his children obtain a good education and maintain a healthier lifestyle, as his farm continues to grow and eventually moves from subsistence farming to commercial scale farming."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1308591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and agricultural technologies to increase maize yields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamilu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":76529.1,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76529.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":790197,"name":"Calleb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Calleb is a married man with children living in Kyenjojo, Uganda. \r\n\r\nHe is a farmer and a cattle trader, buying and selling cattle in various markets in the rural areas and urban areas.

They believe this because they are responsible parents who work very hard at farming so their children can finish school, an opportunity they never had because they were so poor. Mutabar has worked in agriculture since her wedding, and with the unconditional help of her husband, also buys and sells sheep to meet the family\u2019s other needs. Despite this, she now finds herself with more expenses than expected, and would like a loan to increase the size of her flock. Mutabar and her family are hoping for a favorable response to their request. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy spending time with her only son.\r\n\r\nAna plans to use this loan to invest in her jewelry business, by buying rings, bracelets, chains and other accessories. She will also buy clothes. She will use the profits to invest in her business and she dreams of improving it and being able to build her house and buy some furniture. She has had five loans and she is excited to have this new loan and give one step forward to her business improvement.\r\n\r\nAna's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 52 years old and married with 3 children. \r\n\r\nRosa was born into an ordinary family. She was the eldest child; she had five brothers and sisters.  Most of her time was devoted to household chores: looking after younger brothers and sisters, housework, and farm work.  As a child, Rosa dreamed of becoming a police officer to protect the innocent and bring justice. After high school, Rose went to military school, then filed documents to apply for a higher education. After graduation, in Soviet times, fate sent Rosa to serve in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, where she met her future husband. Thus, in 1988, our heroine got married, and a year later the newlywed had a daughter. Since both husband and wife were in the military, life threw them from place to place in rented apartments. \r\n\r\nWhile her husband served his country, the years passed and the family grew to five people. \"We have not had time to look around, and it's time to retire,\"  said Rosa. The couple had been saving for a house for fifteen years, and in 2008 they bought a house in the city center of Karabalta.  With the 10,000 som  they had left, Rosa decided to buy some products and try to resell them.  The first batch went well. Rosa realized that she was able to work in trade and selling in the market. For three years, Rosa has increased her turnover to 60,000 som and was able to pay for tuition at the university for her eldest daughter. To further increase sales and expand the variety of goods she sells, Rose turned to the company Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She wants to use proceeds from this money to open more shops. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.

Ella en particular comercializa carne de cerdos, gallinas caceras y patos. Los productos que comercializa son la mayor\u00eda de su producci\u00f3n, y cuando es necesario compra de sus vecinos.\r\nCabe destacar que es un trabajo muy sacrificado, pues vienen en grupo y se quedan a dormir dos noches en sus puestos de trabajos, y ella a pesar de su edad lo hace siempre con mucho entusiasmo.\r\nEl pr\u00e9stamo solicitado es para la ampliaci\u00f3n de la infraestructura que posee para la cr\u00eda de cerdos. Siendo este actualmente el producto que mayor demanda tienen en la feria y si compra de terceros su ganancia es menor que si los produce ella misma por lo que desea construir un galp\u00f3n de 2 x 2 metros para criar 4 cerdos m\u00e1s."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":49506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To build an extra pig sty\/construcci\u00f3n de un galp\u00f3n para cr\u00eda de cerdos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Encarnaci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-07-18T21:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-01T22:19:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-08-19T09:18:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44448},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-09-19T09:19:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56473},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:26:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69556},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:30:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83748},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:31:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99508},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118228},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138319},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161325},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-04-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":186392},{"amount":15,"local_amount":15,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-19T09:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":214320}],"funded_date":"2007-07-18T22:19:33Z","paid_date":"2008-05-19T09:07:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18406,"name":"Siti","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Siti age 45 started making and selling cakes since 5 years ago.

chickens being sold for lunch, sit 28 women under the shade of an avocado tree.  Shifting periodically to avoid the sun's glare as it tracks across the sky, the women of the Belen communal bank are perched on rocks, steps or sitting flat on the ground, waiting for their meeting to begin.  They have come from all over their town of Cerro de Oro, by foot, tuc tuc, or bus, to this central spot where they have been meeting once a month for the past seven years.  Surrounded by poverty, this avocado tree brings them hope with each meeting.  It is under this tree that they receive their loans from Friendship Bridge and learn how to best invest to change their futures.  \r\n\r\n<P>The majority of the 28 women are artisans, born and raised in a region known for its beautiful weavings. Of the 28 women, 11 are asking for a loan of 32,500 quetzales ($4,275), ranging from $300 to $400 per person.  All of these women will invest their loans in weaving and embroidery businesses, purchasing thread and fabric for intricate huipiles (traditional woven blouses, like the ones in the picture), skirts, scarves, and blankets.  The supplies they purchase come from the nearby town of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  One woman also sells firewood, the main source of fuel in the area, to supplement her weaving business.  She will use about 25% of her loan to invest in firewood.\r\n\r\n<P>Long before the monthly meetings under the avocado tree, the women of Belen worked long days in the factories of other weavers, earning meager incomes that could barely provide food or shelter for their families.  Since joining Friendship Bridge, all 28 women have become their own bosses, opening their own businesses,  employing as many as five other women in turn. They are also teaching their daughters the trade, which is an important aspect of the Atitl\u00e1n culture.  However, their dreams go further for their children.  Their children all attend the local school, and their mothers dream that they will learn to read and write, acquiring knowledge of other things, so that someday they can break free from the struggles of their parents and enter a world full of opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":134642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

Ponta D\u2019Ouro is a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans.\r\n<P>\r\nNarcisio looks after the houses, helps manage all the employees who work there, and does any repair that is needed. He earns R1600 per month (around US$ 200) and is able to save a bit from time to time. His wife Angelica also works in one of the houses as a cleaning lady and earns R600 (about US$ 70) monthly. Narcisio and Angelica live in a room in the back of one of the houses, mainly because Narcisio is also in charge of security. Their children sleep in a house Narcisio is building, but spend most part of the day with them.<P>\r\n\r\nNarcisio first approached Hluvuku in 2000 asking for a loan to start a grocery stand. As the value requested was denied, Narcisio decided to postpone the idea. In 2005 he bought a piece of land and decided to start building a house, so he asked again for a loan to buy construction material, which was approved. This is Narcisio\u2019s third loan and will still be used to buy construction material. The house is almost ready; this time he will buy some missing windows and doors. Before borrowing though Hluvuku, Narcisio used to ask his boss to lend him money, but the boss would make him pay at once, normally deducting from his salary, and that was too much for him. Hluvuku in his opinion is very good because he repays an amount he can afford every month and still has money to support his family.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Narcisio intends to ask for a new loan to keep improving the house and once it is ready, he hopes to start building 2 others, as he already has other land close to his house. He dreams about giving each of his children a house to live in. <P>\r\n\r\nThe picture shows Narcisio with his 9-year-old daughter

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Jupilier is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jupilier from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental.

S\u00e1nchez is 27 years old and has four children between the ages of 2 and 12.  Their names are Yusbania Lizbeth Hern\u00e1ndez, Sara Abigail Suazo, Danilo Jos\u00e9 D., and L\u00e1zaro Josu\u00e9 D..  Except for the youngest, they are all in school.  She and her partner work together.  One of her aspirations is to have her own stall where she can offer her products instead of selling her products as a street vendor.  Another hope of hers is to be able to offer her children a good education so that in the future they can be self-supporting professionals.\r\n\r\nKarla\u2019s business, which she has had for 9 years, is selling plastic bags in the market at the terminal.  She took over the business that her mother had established when Karla was a little girl.  When her mother became ill and could no longer work, Karla did not want to let the business fall so she decided to experiment with the situation.  She continued selling to her mother\u2019s customers and she also was able to add new clients.  She thinks that some day she will be able to get her own vending stall with a good inventory.  The way she plans to use her loan is to buy a greater variety of bags of all sizes to offer to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Melissa Hays, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":218325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-11-09T22:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935111},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858608},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399865},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091848},{"amount":71.42,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985255},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445864},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956517}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T02:33:58Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Hays","image":null}},{"id":75790,"name":"Lai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lai V. is 51 years old and she now lives in Lvea Sor Kandal village in Kandal Province.

Her daughters are also single mothers and are very supportive of her. For the past ten years, Irma had been selling fish from a stand at the local market. She had a very good relationship with her clients, and one of them put her in touch with the American owners of the Inguirilla plant, where she started working two years ago. In order to supplement her earnings, she also sells sodas to her coworkers, which is going very well for her. Her bosses let her carry out this business without any trouble as long as she doesn't neglect her work duties. This is very profitable for her, because she sells a large number of sodas each day. \r\n\r\nThis is Irma's fifth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma. Her favorite part of village bank membership is that her fellow group members are understanding, united, and show great solidarity amongst themselves.

She lives in her own house, and what she wants the most is to improve her quality of life.  She has a business doing metal work.  In her workshop, she molds the metal and coverts it into diverse forms like wheelbarrows, desks, chairs, etc.  She also repairs broken things to generate extra income.  She currently works with an assistant, who does the work that requires more physical effort.  What she likes the most about her job is fixing broken things that people bring her because she fixes them very well even though she is a woman.  She has done this work for 15 years, and the thing that she likes the least is having to obtain metals to mold because transporting them is hard and tiring.  This is Simona's third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and just like with her other loans, she is willing to make all of her payments on time.  She is very loved in her communal bank because she always worries about others' well-being.
