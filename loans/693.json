It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Angelito L., a bus driver, and is the mother of a young boy now at preparatory school. By the grace of God, Gemma has managed to support her child's schooling and she is now working hard to be able to send him all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Gemma, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nGemma maintains a direct sales business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct selling brands such as Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and others. A customer's order is paid for in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer, who has a one-month-to-pay credit. Since dealers\u2019 cost prices are lower than those in the catalog, they earn profit on the price difference. Gemma's regular customers are her neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 700 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Gemma is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

Working seven days-a- week, and ten hours a day, he earns about Le 1,200,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Mohamed has already received, and successfully repaid three loans. He now requires a new loan in order to buy additional mini dresses, tan tops, and cotton shirts.

Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 500.000.-, Sapitriah bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 25.000.- per hari. Namun keuntungan itu harus disisihkan untuk membiayai hidupnya dan seorang anaknya uang berusia 5 tahun, sedangkan suaminya berprofesi sebagai pedagang sandal dan tas yang dipasarkan dengan cara berkeliling di sekitar lingkungan tempat tinggalnya atau di desa lainya.\r\nKarena menempati lokasi yang strategis, dagangan Sapitriah banyak dikunjungi oleh pelanggan. Namun karena keterbatasan modal, seringkali pelanggan tidak mendapat yang diinginkannya. Setelah mendapat pinjaman dana dari Dinari, Sapitriah menambah variasi dagangannya sehingga para pelanggan menjadi puas karena semua keinginannya bisa terpenuhi.

She faced many difficulties before joining the TYM fund because her husband had passed away early, leaving her with 2 small children. She made the first loan of 2,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to invest in the manufacturing of bricks. This business usually brings in 400,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. Until now, the family\u2019s main income still came from making bricks. The business has since expanded and she can now hire another worker. To increase her moneymaking prospects, she raises pigs, chickens, and fish. She plans to make the next loan of 15,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to buy supplies and food for the animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The city\u2019s climate is cold and is characterized by its churches and by the beauty that surrounds it.  Its city center is a mix of colonial and modern, and its people are amiable and hardworking, always striving for personal and familial growth.\r\n\r\nMrs Rosa Lucrecia Gonz\u00e1les is an active member of the Banco Comunal Ensue\u00f1os.  She lives in the center of Azogues, is 37 years old, and is married, with two sons ages 16 and 12.  Her sons attend El Colegio La Salle.  Her husband emigrated abroad in search of a better future for the family.  They do not have a home of their own yet, which is why they rent.\r\n\r\nRosa has been working at a beauty salon for the past 3 years, from 8:00 am to noon and from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm Monday through Saturday.  She is also in the process of starting her own business selling cosmetics from the L\u2019Bel brand (beauty products for women).  She\u2019s been working at this for 7 months and says it\u2019s going well because her job helps build up her clientele. \r\n\r\nAt the Banco, Rosa is very amiable and gets along well with the other members.

The loans have helped her establish herself financially, and with this current loan from ESPOIR she will invest in the purchase of more beauty products so she may offer a better variety to her clients.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to travel the world with her husband and sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maya Wisnievitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":400578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase L\u00b4bel beauty products for women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-06T21:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":184.7,"local_amount":184.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":184.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947524},{"amount":184.7,"local_amount":184.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:55Z","rounded_local_amount":184.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789379},{"amount":88.95,"local_amount":88.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":88.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679815},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679816},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074396},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074397},{"amount":274.97,"local_amount":274.97,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":274.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910407},{"amount":0.04,"local_amount":0.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":0.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946033},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946034}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T15:25:30Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maya Wisnievitz","image":846125}},{"id":146318,"name":"Edmonde","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"K.

She began as part of the Buen Samaritano group and later with the Diamante group for twelve cycles.  She is now taking out loans individually.  This is her third individual loan.  She is a very hard worker, since before her husband passed away she was in charge of maintaining the household and educating her two children, who are still young and who attend school.  With the previous loans she took out, she purchased goods for her house and for her business.  She lives in her mother's house, has good references from neighbors, and is a good borrower.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva

She lives alone in a house that her parents gave her. She is not married and she wishes most to lead a peaceful life. The tailor\u2019s trade is an activity that comes to her through family, since she learned the art from her father when she was still very young. Her business is very popular and her clients line up so that she can tailor their garments. Even though she has many clients, she works alone since her income will not permit her to hire an assistant to help her speed up the preparation of her orders. On the other hand, the thing she likes most about her work is finishing the garment. She has spent 20 years tailoring and considers the most difficult part is to have to stay in her shop all day. \r\n\r\nJulia longs for her business to grow with time, and for it to become one of the most recognized tailoring shops in the city of Juliaca. This is the sixth loan that Julia has had with MFP and she has already arranged to make prompt payments as she has no wish to cause problems for her partners at the community bank where she participates actively. With the 2,000 nuevos soles (PEN) she is asking for, she would buy new materials to make her garments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick Clarke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":476189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T20:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124521},{"amount":120.72,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960262},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993106},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717892},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751567},{"amount":121.44,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":346.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934035}],"funded_date":"2010-01-23T23:47:30Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Clarke","image":null}},{"id":175324,"name":"W.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"R. is a 44 year old woman.

She has operated a small general store for several years, a business that she started with help from her husband who has a truck that he uses to make deliveries for the store.  The couple has four children, three of whom are in school and able to help around the house.  The oldest works.  She started the business with only a handful of products, selling firewood, fruits and vegetables.  With her earnings, she was able to buy food and everyday supplies but the money never stretched far enough to make improvements to her little house, a house built from wood and earth that Zoraida would like to improve for the well-being of her children.  She will use this loan to buy construction materials--stone, sand, cement--so that she can remove the wood and enclose the entire structure in concrete, something that will better secure the house.  She is happy to have received this loan and past ones because they have helped her to improve both her house and her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":522041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Buy construction materials for home improvement project.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-09T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soraida Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.81,"local_amount":1106.4,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1129.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640166},{"amount":53,"local_amount":1110.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821958},{"amount":52.96,"local_amount":1109.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561968},{"amount":52.97,"local_amount":1109.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770883},{"amount":53.66,"local_amount":1124.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204775},{"amount":51.98,"local_amount":1089.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1111.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330473},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":1117.59,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465631},{"amount":52.21,"local_amount":1093.85,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097778},{"amount":53.23,"local_amount":1115.29,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348403},{"amount":48.84,"local_amount":1023.49,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766086}],"funded_date":"2010-04-14T04:07:29Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":196246,"name":"Randy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Randy M. is from the village of Agunod Plaridel Misamis Occidental.

The four members of the group are Francisca S., Refugio C., Juana G., and Ma Esperanza C..  Their business activities are as follows:  Francisca sells shoes at retail; Refugio creates paintings to sell; Juana sells fritters and donuts in the evenings; and Ma Esperanza wants to sell food on the weekends.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Francisca S. is a member of the group.  She is married and has three children (ages 20, 17, and 12).  Francisca wants to concentrate on her business so that she can help her husband with the household expenses.  She is confident that selling shoes and sandals is a good business and plans to offer her products in the main squares of the surrounding villages in her community.  The people who live there have limited resources, so she does not want to sell anything expensive.\r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca will use her loan to buy sandals, shoes, boots, flip-flops, and other items in Leon Guanajuato.  Her goal for the future is to have a great business and many customers so that one day her children can get ahead and earn a degree.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca says she feels very fortunate to have been granted a loan.  She wanted to pursue financing due to the low interest and because she is serious about her business.

She lives with her husband and their seven children in the Pueblo Joven Jes\u00fas Nazareno in the Monsef\u00fa district, which is located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling fish for four years in the market in city of Pomalca, which is located ten minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  She sells the products that she buys in the fish terminal in the city of Santa Rosa, which is ten minutes from where she lives.\r\n\r\nHer husband works occasionally as a traditional local fisherman.  With the money collected between the two of them, they try to get ahead for their family.  But, what they receive is not enough to support them.\r\n\r\nThat is why they have seen the necessity of asking our institution, for the first time, for a loan for 600 PEN.  They plan to buy more fish to sell.\r\n\r\nHer biggest wish is to provide her seven children with the possibility of assuring themselves of a promising future by studying a technical field or getting a college education.\r\n\r\nRosa is well known and held in high esteem by her neighbors and colleagues in the market.  They consider her to be a happy and responsible woman who works arduously every day to give her household a better future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":381528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy fish to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Monsef\u00fa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T20:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":47.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":52.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":55.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":56.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":67.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.02},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.77},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.85},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.7},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.1},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.02,"local_amount":42.72,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":47.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939683},{"amount":16.77,"local_amount":44.72,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":49.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780593},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":47.59,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669491},{"amount":17.85,"local_amount":47.6,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065001},{"amount":19.7,"local_amount":52.55,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":58.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900115},{"amount":20.78,"local_amount":55.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":61.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934249},{"amount":21.12,"local_amount":56.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":62.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661902},{"amount":22.1,"local_amount":58.95,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":65.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694621},{"amount":23.26,"local_amount":62.01,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":68.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877687},{"amount":24.3,"local_amount":64.81,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":71.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617740},{"amount":25.25,"local_amount":67.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":74.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832159}],"funded_date":"2009-09-03T06:01:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":138093,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina sells foodstuffs in retail to her customers.

The financing he is requesting will be used as working capital which will be invested in the purchase of leather, fabric, zippers, and sewing needles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":411187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-10-22T01:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Salomon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":875.04,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":900.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790855},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":874.96,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":900.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681350},{"amount":47.12,"local_amount":942.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:51Z","rounded_local_amount":970.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075878},{"amount":40.38,"local_amount":807.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":831.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911887},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:55Z","rounded_local_amount":900.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947740},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":900.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676005},{"amount":48.66,"local_amount":973.27,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710376},{"amount":38.84,"local_amount":776.73,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":799.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045696}],"funded_date":"2009-10-22T08:11:42Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":150464,"name":"Lucerito Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \" Lucerito \" Esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Marleny y conformada por 12 socias muy trabajadoras y que van cumpliendo su tercer ciclo juntas demostrando responsabilidad, uni\u00f3n y sobre todo expectativas D. lograr mejorar mas aun su calidad D. vida y la D. su familias.

It is comprised of 12 very hard-working members.  They are completing their third cycle together.  They demonstrate responsibility; union; and, above all, the expectation to improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.  The women have had a friendship for a very long time.  They are very dynamic in their work.  They sell bread, have a grocery store, sell food, and sell cosmetics.  Some work in their own homes, and others are street vendors.  As far as competition goes, it does exist in their neighborhood.  But, the members have their customers who continually generate enough economic movement to get an income that will support their families.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy merchandise to stock their stores and wholesale supplies like sugar and flour to make bread.  The cosmetic representatives will take advantage of offers to get better earnings.  Their greatest expectation is to have more income and to be more economically independent.  They want to have more capital and better income to support their families.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She and her husband live in Paij\u00e1n district, Ascope province, in the region of La Libertad, about three hours from the city of Chiclayo. In order to provide for her family, Carmelina used to have to travel to Chile to get work. \r\n\r\nShe returned a year ago to work in Peru doing what she most enjoys: cooking. She opened a restaurant in rented premises located on the the Panamerican highway. There she cooks a variety of traditional meals for truck drivers, tourists, and the general public. The number of customers has been increasing over the year because of the tasty food and good service. Carmelina wishes to prepare more dishes so that her business can grow, but she lacks the necessary capital. She has applied to Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 soles to purchase ingredients. Carmelina says that her dream is to open a restaurant in premises that she herself owns and she is working towards fulfilling that dream. \r\n\r\nCarmelina has been a client of Edpyme Alternativa before and shown herself to be responsible in the repayment of her loan installments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":439862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for making traditional foods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan - Ascope - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-12-03T20:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":96.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":104.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":107.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":111.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":114.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.73},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.19,"local_amount":83.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":84.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669681},{"amount":31.97,"local_amount":91.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":92.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065182},{"amount":31.99,"local_amount":91.41,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":92.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900285},{"amount":33.89,"local_amount":96.84,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":98.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934435},{"amount":33.95,"local_amount":96.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":98.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662051},{"amount":35.73,"local_amount":102.08,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":103.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694758},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":104.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":106.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877814},{"amount":37.73,"local_amount":107.8,"processed_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":109.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617861},{"amount":39.07,"local_amount":111.64,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":113.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832270},{"amount":39.97,"local_amount":114.19,"processed_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":116.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098894}],"funded_date":"2009-12-17T06:15:02Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":162890,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 22-year-old single lady with no children.

She is 49 years old. Amelia is the group leader of a four-member group applying for a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAmelia is married and has two school-age children. To make a living, Amelia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Amelia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP when she sells one of her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Amelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Amelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 22000 PHP from ASKI. Amelia is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Amelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Rami has a store for selling generators. He wants to improve his store and increase his sales. He hopes to increase his income by purchasing more generators to sell. However, the amount of money he has isn't enough, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Rami gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase more generators for sale and have a better collection for sale. This will increase his income and provide him with better life conditions. Rami is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

The second chance loan program provides loans to people who have a bad credit history and have no access to credit products.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1538598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase four calves and forage for the livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Bazum village, Lori region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":169,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artyom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.49},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":112.11},{"due_date":"2014-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":117.74},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.91},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.45},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.45},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.09},{"due_date":"2014-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":119.27},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.19},{"due_date":"2015-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2015-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":126.55},{"due_date":"2015-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":126.02},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.12},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125.96},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.92},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.25},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":129.43},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.63},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":133.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":134.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.49},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.11},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.74},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.91},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.45},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.45},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.09},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.27},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.19},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.78},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.55},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.02},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.12},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.96},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.92},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.43},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.31},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":737800,"name":"Ayitcheme 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement AYITCHEME 2 est form\u00e9 de dix personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

She is married and has four children. They live within the Kibera slums of Nairobi. She also takes care of six orphans left behind by her brother who passed away in 2000 due to HIV\/AIDS.\r\n\r\nInitially, Pamela was employed at a salon where she was paid by commission for the work done.  However, the pay was little. She persevered because she had a large family looking up to her. Pamela saved some money from the two years she was employed, which she used to buy a second-hand blowdryer and dryer. Afterwards, through a village merry-go-round group for women, Pamela received Ksh 2,000 (USD 28) which she used to purchase combs, towels and a sink.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Pamela started her own salon. Due to her skill in hairdressing, including braiding, weaving, perming (chemical application for hair straightening) and styling, the demand for her services has increased. She is therefore requesting a loan of USD 100 to enable her buy an additional blowdryer, four big chairs and two small chairs for the children. \r\n\r\nBecause her clientele has increased, she wants them to be comfortable while waiting to be served.

He is 52, married with two children and lives in the village of Saatli town in the south-central flat area of the Azerbaijan Republic in the Caucasus region.\r\n\r\nNizami has run his business since early childhood when he helped his father to graze the family herd.  After he married and lived separately, Nizami started his own business with two cows given to him as a gift by his father.  Today his number of milk producing cows has risen to 12.  \r\n\r\nNizami sells 120 litres of milk daily in Saatli town, but he sees that he can provide more customers with milk.  To do this he has to increase the number of milk cows in his herd.

Fortunita's dreams are to add on to her house, have a larger selection of products for her business, and that her children go to school and become professionals. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":281967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of sweaters and pants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-03-08T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27089291},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982608},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443124},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953418}],"funded_date":"2009-03-08T13:23:40Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":97114,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth owns a poultry farm where she rears poultry birds.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is very active and hardworking since she is responsible for all of her home expenses. She has been a member of the ALCOM \u201cGrupo Unido\u201d for three and a half years together with nine other people and currently holds the position of treasurer in the group. Leila works at selling clothing, shoes and accessories, offering them to all the people she knows, going door to door and visiting companies. She began this business as a young woman because already at 15 years old she had to think about how to take care of her daughter, so she started selling gelatin as a vendor. Thus, she earned a little income, which was 160 soles that she used to buy clothes to sell to her neighbors and friends. In the beginning, she was not earning much due to her lack of experience. With hard work and effort, she has been able to acquire items for her house, furniture, give her daughters an education and help her mother pay off her debt. The requested loan will go towards the down payment on a motorscooter, which will be very useful for transporting her merchandise since she currently must walk a great deal bearing the weight. With a means of transport, it will be easier for her and she will be able to visit more customers. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":411260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Down payment for a motorscooter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neridad Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":818.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":818.75,"local_amount":2325,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2333.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780211},{"amount":491.25,"local_amount":1395,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1400.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669080},{"amount":1146.25,"local_amount":3255,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3266.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064538},{"amount":818.75,"local_amount":2325,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2333.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899603}],"funded_date":"2009-11-23T02:51:48Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tara Binetti","image":null}},{"id":150496,"name":"Justiniano Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Justiniano tiene 41 a\u00f1os, es separado , y vive con sus 2 hijos en su casa propia la cual es de adobe.

He considers his business to be rather profitable because it allows him to support his family, invest in his lands, and save for any unexpected event.

She is 60 years old. Restituta is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Restituta owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a mini-restaurant. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from serving a variety of different meals to customers like adobo & afritada in the local community. Restituta has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Restituta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Restituta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase food & drinks for the restaurant. Restituta is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients like meat & vegetables & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Restituta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. mujer\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People there also face the cold, the difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<P>\r\nBCR \u201cAmanecer D. L. mujer\u201d, whose name can be translated as the \u201cAwakening of the Woman\u201d, is located in the community of AntacalL. in the district of Anco, province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are growing corn (lower altitudes), potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes); raising guinea-pigs, pigs, and chicken, and they also have cows and bulls. The community of AntacalL. faces many difficulties due to its remoteness, lack of public transportation and access to markets. It receives very little in the way of public and social services. <P>\r\n\r\nThe bank has just completed half a year of existence and its first loan-cycle, with currently 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 3,600 soles (about US$ 1,240). The loans range from 100, 200, 400 soles, up to 600 soles. Besides repaying their loans, the group was able to save over 1,500 soles (about US$ 520)  during the first loan-cycle, and they will continue to put asiD. savings in the future.<P>\r\n\r\nDuring their first loan cycle, most members have learned how to do business. Whereas before most of their production was for home consumption, more and more they have learned to be entrepreneurs, to earn a little money with the work they do.  And, sometimes for the first time in their lives, they have learned how to improve the quality of their lives and the importance of saving.\r\n<P>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Saturnina Dur\u00e1n Chacasan. Saturnina buys and sells \"tuna\", the fruit of the tuna-cactus. Besides buying the fruit down at the Mantaro river-basin, she grows her own tuna in a small field of tuna-cactuses. She sells her tunas in one of the major cities in the central Peruvian Andes, Huancayo, more than 5 hours away from AntacalL.--at least, when she is lucky enough to find transportation. Her new loan of 500 soles, she will not invest in her tuna-business, however. This time she will buy a cow! Starting a new business! Although the cow will cost her 1,000 soles, she will put in the other half of the price of the cow herself, from her savings. One of the things she learned in FINCA Peru is not to talk badly of other people.<P>\r\n\r\nAnother story is that of Florentina M. Dur\u00e1n, who has her business of baking and selling bread. Like all women in the community bank, she also has her fields with corn and wheat. Most of the production is for home consumption, but fortunately she also is able to sell some of her product. She will invest her 200 soles loan to buy more wheat for her bakery.\r\n<P>\r\nRosa Ana S. D. L. C., who has requested a 400 soles loan, has a small business selling shoes, and Sundays when AntacalL. has its weekly market, she also sells meals. She will invest her loan in buying new shoes for her business. It's a good time for that, because schools are about to start again, and most children need new shoes to go with their school uniforms. And, like most members of her group, her dream is for her family to improve their quality of life and for her four children to study. She will use her savings for buying school necessities because a new school year is starting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":137343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"expanding their small businesses or starting up new ones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-20T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norberte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayela Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T21:11:29Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199956},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226957},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256202},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284933},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315124},{"amount":210,"local_amount":592.94,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":604.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346665}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T21:11:29Z","paid_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":43860,"name":"Kulwa's Umoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kulwa M. is 58 years old, married and has two children, ages 21 and 19.

I. is 36 years old and lives in a monogamous family with one child in the area of Attbougou, one of the outlying areas of the city of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali). For social reasons, she left school early. After attempting many profit-generating businesses without success, her grandmother taught her the secret art of incense (traditional deodorant) production. She finished her apprenticeship and for the last 10 years has practiced this business. Today, she enjoys the benefits of a good reputation on a regional scale. She receives orders from all over the sub-region of West Africa (Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). To make a good quality incense with a pleasant smell requires magnonkis\u00e8ni, an exotic plant highly valued in West Africa, to be seasoned with perfumes and eau de Cologne for one month. To satisfy her growing clientele, she decided two years ago to join Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. After four joint group loans all which were properly repaid, she has requested her first individual loan. With this loan she plans to purchase 30 kg of incense seed (magnonkis\u00e8ni), 70 kg of K\u00e8ni (natural incense), 15 boxes of perfume (including eau de Cologne) and empty bottles. She gets her supplies mostly from the large market in the city of S\u00e9gou and sells her product for cash or on credit to a clientele composed mainly of women and men from Mali and neighboring countries. When weddings take place she is in very high demand due to the fact that her product is highly valued by newlyweds. She plans to earn a monthly income of 50,000 FCFA which will be used mainly to increase her business capital. Her dream is to build a new home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

The rainy season is the most difficult time for Juan as his sales are very low during this time.  He has had his business for 6 years and feels that it is time to grow.  He always takes some sweets from his stand to give to his beloved nephews, who love him like a father.  This is the first loan that Juan has applied for and he is confident that he will be able to make the payments on time.  He is one of the most active members of his community bank and is well loved and respected.  With the money from the loan he will purchase more merchandise to help grow his business.\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":271200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase his inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117057},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011970},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595555},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989817},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210953},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640458}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T06:53:05Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Raimondi","image":549898}},{"id":93034,"name":"Jesus Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas es socio del Banco Comunal Las Gaviotas.\nJes\u00fas es conviviente, tiene 38 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Jes\u00fas de acuerdo a la temporada y demanda vende diferentes productos como en \u00e9poca escolar vende mochilas, en carnavales talco, serpentinas.

For example, the SOAT, which is an insurance that covers all medical treatments for his passengers in case of an accident.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
