She is 34 years old. Eugenia is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Eugenia owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale. Eugenia has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eugenia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eugenia is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the first loan taken out by Eugenia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

By working hard in his business, he is gradually making his family more economically stable. He now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Efren is borrowing PHP 15,000 in order to purchase more inventory to sell. This will be his 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. His previous loan of PHP 14,000, which he paid off well within its term, was just another step in his journey toward economic freedom. Efren hopes to elevate his family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n \nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week. Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients.\n\n","en":"The APEC sub-group Al Ouma Tivaouane Diacksao, Group 2, consists of fifteen women who all live in the same locality.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON International's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Angelito M., a community worker, and they are blessed with three children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.\r\n\r\nMarissa has been managing her direct-selling business for the past few years. She sells clothing, cosmetics and footwear from the popular direct selling brands.\r\n\r\nMarissa has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Marissa would like to apply for a PHP 32,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more advance orders for her customers.\r\n\r\nMarissa dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.

She is married to Edwin R. and is mother to two young, hard-working adults and two school-aged children. By the grace of God, Luzviminda has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLuzviminda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piecemeal rates.  Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nLuzviminda dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, from the results of all her work with the business.

It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rodel earns income by getting supplies in wholesale price and selling them as single items.  His store is located adjacent to their house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of Php400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Rodel continue operations of his business, he is requesting a Php25, 000 loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory.

clothes, shoes, and blankets, depending upon her orders, to sell from a table in the market near her home. She has one employee and has been in business for a year.\r\n \r\nLynda is married, and her husband is employed as a handyman in a local shop. She is 27 years old. Together they have two children, a two-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl who attends school. Her younger sister looks after her toddler when she is away for business. She has found it difficult to find the right person to look after the children whilst she is away.

The main activity is fishing. However, being fishermen by trade, we are confronted with different difficulties to carry through our activity. The scarcity of fish, to name one among others, is forcing us to go further and further from the coasts to fish.  This requires high quality equipment. This state of affair brings on poverty that in turn engenders illegal immigration, emptying our village of its youth. The goal of this loan is to equip ourselves with a dugout canoe in order to have better and more adequate equipment  for our work. This by the same token would give permanent employment to the young fishermen of the group. The activity is fishing and the sale of products from the sea. <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva

She lives alone with her husband.  Alma has a store that sells perishable goods and products for personal use in the home.  Said business is very profitable, since it is the only one of its kind in the vicinity, so everyone comes to make their purchases there.  Alma is a woman who has always fought to get ahead and for that reason she is requesting the loan, through which she'll be able to stock her store.  Even though the profits are very good, they don't allow her to invest more in the store, due to her high household expenses.

Her business has grown but she says it's difficult because there are many other lapa sellers nearby, so competition is stiff.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating a fishing and a livestock business. Her husband, William Z., is 36 years old and works as a backhoe operator. They have four children who range in age from 8 to 10. Florina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of four previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has succeeded in slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her last loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, and brought an improved life to her family. Now, for her fifth loan, she would like to borrow PHP 12,000 to buy new fishing equipment. This will allow her to increase her income further and continue to save for her children's education. Florina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

store. She is married, has four children and is determined to provide a better living for family. She is hard working and kind, and is committed to her business and providing outstanding service. She is skilled at what she does and has a perfect credit history with IMON International. Mastura has applied for a loan for $1,500 to buy the equipment she needs to expand her business and improve the financial situation of her family.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being the home of a key post along the Silk Road and the place where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now she sells footwear as an walking vendor, and in her home she sells ice cream. She learned this business by observing the business of one of her aunts.

When she was a child she worked putting her parents' cattle out to pasture and since she married she changed her activity to work primarily at home; her husband is a professor. But now that her children are already grown she cannot be without carrying out some activity which is why she started to work in agriculture, which she likes very much and is very profitable, above all in harvest times when she negotiates her products. It is difficult for her in periods of planting and harvesting as she cannot do it all herself and sometimes she does not find laborers to help her. She is very grateful for her IMF, because she says it has allowed her to have economic independence.

Mr. Leay S. is the 66- year-old village bank president. He and his wife, Mrs. Vang Mao, are farmers who own 1.5-hectare field of land to cultivate rice. In this plantation, they face a problem because they do not have enough money to hire laborers to harvest rice. In order to solve this problem, Mr. Leay S. decided to request a loan for this purpose. He is the father of two children, one of whom is a laborer in the hospital while the other is employed in a garment factory.  \r\n\r\nOne member of this group loan has an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

business sphere for several years. He used to sell dried fruit but, having gradually saved money, he opened a mini-canteen, located at the central market. Bahrom is also a cook by training. He has regular customers among the local vendors. In addition to the dishes offered in his canteen, Bahrom sells pastry: buns, cakes, ginger cookies, etc. Many of his clients, in addition to hot dishes, order dessert. Bahrom is 38 years old and is married with one child. His wife is a stay-at-home mom. Besides his main business, with the help of his wife Bahrom raises cattle. A year ago Bahrom got a Microinvest loan for this purpose, and got a reputation of a responsible and punctual client.

For the last three years she has earned her living by selling groceries from the store located in her house. She offers a wide variety of products to her many regular customers. Maria enjoys her work very much as while she sells her merchandise, she chats to the customers\u2014she is a very charismatic person. \r\n\r\nBut it isn\u2019t an easy life.

She is 37 years old and married to Pelagio, who is a farmer. They have three children between the ages of 12 and 19. Two of them are still attending school and one is working in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, and helps her parents support their family by sending money every month. Jonalyn wants her children to finish their studies, and she wants to help her husband earn income for their family.\r\n \r\nTo help her husband earn a living for the family, she put up a small general store adjacent to their house. At the start, her earnings were small, but it helped support their household expenses, and she saw that it had potential for expansion if she only had the necessary capital to fill her store with products to sell. This is why she joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 1988, and with the additional capital from her loans, she is now able to earn a monthly income of about $213 a month, most of which she spends for their household expenses. She is also saving up for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nNow she is in her 18th loan cycle, borrowing 27,000 PHP as additional working capital for her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":434777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Saifullo is married and has one child. He is a farmer and agriculture has become his beloved job, and has been the principle source of income for him for the last ten years. On his land he produces different kinds of produce. Thanks to his experiences that he gained during ten years, he gets a rich harvest every year from his land.\r\n\r\nIn light of the current high demand, Saifullo would like to improve his land and production to meet the market. In order to do this, he is seeking a loan of 8,000 Somoni to buy fuels and lubricants and fertilizer for improving and expanding his harvest. He would then be able to better take care of his family's health and food needs.\r\n\r\nYou could become an important part of the life of Saifullo\u2019s family. He deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This loan of 500,000 Rwandan francs served to buy maize flour, sugar, soap, and sodas (Fanta) so that he can increase his turnover and continue to make progress, especially economically speaking. He says that his ambition is to reimburse his loan well so that the Bank will accord him a larger amount and he can buy a lot of items so as to increase the profit from his business and become a wholesaler. \n\nIn the future he intends to improve his business by buying more products and improve his living conditions. Apart from that, he intends to have a wife and children and a good household later on so as to reconstruct his country. \n\n\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":555334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase of soap, maize flour, and beans to stock his shop better","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyamata-Bugesera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":126656.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151836787},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126656.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577525},{"amount":437.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":253312.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788080}],"funded_date":"2010-06-18T19:57:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":212352,"name":"Dorothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorothy N.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

A trav\u00e9s de estos a\u00f1os Gladys ha trabajado muy duro para que sus cultivos sean de muy buena calidad, todas las ma\u00f1anas con la ayuda de su esposo, trabaja sus tierras, para que sean mas productivas. La papa y arveja que cultiva, lo vende en el mercado de la ciudad de Tarma, ya que es ah\u00ed donde le ofrecen mejores precios. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar, lleva 10 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos, hasta los mercados donde los vende. Con el tiempo, espera poder sembrar todas sus tierras, para poder incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Es el primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP y quiere pagar sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que desea acceder a m\u00e1s pr\u00e9stamos, con lo cuales pueda mejorar su negocio, sabe que en su banco comunal la apoyan y gu\u00edan sus compa\u00f1eras del grupo.

She lives in her own home together with her husband Jose, 36 years old, and their two beloved children, Jayer, 8 years old, and Angel, 4 years old. They are the driving force behind all her efforts. Over the years Gladys has worked very hard in her plantations to yield high quality harvests. Every morning she and her husband work the fields so make them more productive. \r\nThe potato and sweet pea harvests are sold in the city of Tarma, location where she gets the best prices. What she most enjoys about her work is the harvest. She has 10 years' experience in the field. The most difficult part of the work is having to transport the harvest to the markets where it will be sold. In time she hopes to cultivate the entire expanse of her fields to increase production. This loan is the first she requests through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is committed to the responsibilities of the loan.  She wishes to acquire future loans to keep developing her business.

Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Marilyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Ylaria has spent the greater part of her life in her beloved village of Santa Rosa. Since she was a very young girl, she has learned how to farm; today she works on her own fields at her husband's side, where together they grow cacao, coffee and coca leaves. This work has provided the income necessary to cover the needs of her children. She sells everything she harvests to the wholesale centers located in the city of San Francisco, where she receives better prices for each of her products. What she likes most about her work is planting her fields, and she does this with great care. She has done this work for 9 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is transporting her products, since cargo vehicles are very scarce in this part of the rainforest zone of the Apurimac river valley. With time, she would like to buy new lands, with the aim of increasing her production. This is her fifth loan with MFP; she has been very punctual with her previous loans and she plans to continue in the same way. In her communal bank, she is very active and very well-liked by the rest of the members. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy compost and fertilizers to improve her cacao and coffee production. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":750410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy compost and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ylaria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":162.84},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":174.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":181.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":186.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":194.49},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":203.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":210.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":220.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":227.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":236.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.03},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.73},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.03,"local_amount":162.84,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":165.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270212},{"amount":63.32,"local_amount":174.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":177.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550231},{"amount":65.83,"local_amount":181.61,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":184.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718906},{"amount":67.73,"local_amount":186.83,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":190.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350374},{"amount":70.5,"local_amount":194.49,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":198.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850869},{"amount":73.93,"local_amount":203.94,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":207.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665993},{"amount":76.42,"local_amount":210.82,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":214.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621176},{"amount":79.9,"local_amount":220.39,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":224.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835336},{"amount":82.6,"local_amount":227.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":232.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245134},{"amount":85.74,"local_amount":236.52,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":240.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385277}],"funded_date":"2011-04-22T15:21:28Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":294309,"name":"Carmelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmelita is 56 years old and widowed, with one child.

Given that her husband's salary is not enough to pay the school expenses of their children, she decided to sell flour tortillas among her friends and relatives.

After thinking about the needs of the people in her neighborhood, she decided to sell clothes to offer to her friends, and with the help of her husband, she has been gathering a good clientele. <p>\r\nHowever, the clothes she has right now are for the summer season and she cannot keep offering that to her clients, since this business requires a constant rotation of merchandise.

Later on, she found herself unfit to this field, since she experienced loss from fish vending. Instead of getting discouraged, she shifted her attention to sewing bridal dresses. Soon she was able to save enough capital to open a boutique. From this, she gets to support her husband in feeding their three children and providing their family needs.\r\n\r\nAlthough her business is presently stable and growing, Lorna is requesting the Community Economic Ventures Inc. (CEVI) to grant her a loan to expand her boutique. She aspires to have a tailoring shop in the future. Based on what she has learned at CEVI, this goal is just close at hand if she continues her hard work and pairs this with faith in the Almighty.

Habib is a 47-year-old farmer, who lives with his wife and three children in the Northern part of Tajikistan, in Spitamen. Habib has two milk cows and sells dairy products to the local traders. He has five years of experience in raising cattle and selling dairy products. Habib's dairy products are in very high demand in his village; however the milk from two cows is not enough to meet demand. Habib is therefore applying for a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase an additional cow and fodder. Habib is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his standard of living through this loan.\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is part of the microfinance program because these loans are for business and she really likes that.\r\n\r\nClara is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza. She has had her business for around one month, starting with some savings she had. After she started was when she discovered the Esperanza program. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing like 10 skirts, 10 pairs of pants, blouses and shirts. She will use the profits to save and to study. She is dreaming to have enough income to help her children in everything they need, especially in their studies.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in Los Arcarrizos, a dusty, industrial area north of the capital where free-trade zones are common. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

Central Asian countries are not an exception. The highest value for people is family ties. They are very strong and are kept tight for generations. Therefore, people always help out their children and their parents, both morally and financially in any kind of situation. \r\n\r\nBurulbu M., 53, is from the village of Aravan in southern Kyrgyzstan. Burulbu has been married for 27 years now and has two grown children. Her husband is a dentist. Her older son has chosen a military career and her younger son has decided to follow his father\u2019s steps and become a professional dentist. \r\n\r\nBurulbu and her daughter-in-law are busy with raising and selling cattle. In ten years of being in business, the family already has managed to purchase a car and arrange a nice wedding for their older son. Burulbu plans to spend this loan on construction materials for building a temporary house. In the near future, she would like to adorn her house with new furniture and continue helping her younger son to get a good medical education.\r\n\r\nYulduzkhon A., 41, sells vegetables and fruits in the local market. Yulduzkhon plans to spend some part of the loan on broadening her business and the rest on purchasing construction materials. When she has the opportunity, she plans to open a small shop in the village.\r\n\r\nTojikhon H., 55, raises and sells sheep. Her business was started two years ago, and by now she has already made major repairs to her house. Tojikhon applied for this loan in order to get new furniture as a gift for her daughter\u2019s wedding. \r\n\r\nMavjuda E., 38, is a farmer. Thanks to her business she moved to a new house. She would like to spend this loan on buying new furniture for her daughter\u2019s house. Also, with the profit from her business, she would like to repair her house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line: people (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Antonio\u2019s \u201cSouthtown District\u201d (just south of downtown).  They bake custom-order cakes for weddings and special events, as well as offering coffee, food, and desserts in their caf\u00e9.  A few weeks ago, Joyce and Rick expanded their menu to include deli food, giving customers dining options for any time of the day. \r\n \r\nHaving baked recreationally for most of her life, Joyce dreamed of someday owning her own bakery.    Prior to opening \u201cFrosted Delights by Joyce,\u201d she spent twenty years working with AT&T.  Rick spent most of his life in the trucking industry and was working as an operations supervisor when the recession forced the company he was working for to eliminate his position.  Instead of looking for a new job in the trucking business, Rick, together with  Joyce, decided to retire from their careers and launch their own business.\r\n\r\nRick and Joyce opened \u201cFrosted Delights by Joyce\u201d in November, 2010.  In the six months they have been in business, they have already developed a loyal clientele.   For them, it is rewarding to see repeat customers walk through their doors because it tells them they are doing a good job.  They hope to continue growing the deli and delivery part of their business by capitalizing on their location close to downtown.  With all of the companies in the area, they see great opportunity for growth.\r\n\r\nRick says that he and Joyce work more hours now than they ever have, but that being personally and emotionally invested in the business makes it all worthwhile.  In addition to the two of them, Frosted Delights by Joyce has two part-time employees.  Joyce and Rick are using this loan to purchase more equipment.  For example, they need more baking pans, and as their business continues to grow, will soon need another oven.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9100,"image":{"id":750470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Junto a su esposo, Honorata trabaja todos los d\u00edas en sus tierras. Con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado que sus tierras sean muy productivas, pues ah\u00ed  siembra de todo un poco, ya que sabe que todo producto que obtenga ser\u00e1 de calidad. Ella principalmente siembra plantas de cacao y caf\u00e9 ya que estos son los productos que mejor precio tiene en los mercados.\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cuidar sus sembr\u00edos de la plaga de insectos que pueden afectarlas, lo cual reducir\u00eda mucho sus ganancias. Lleva 20 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos, hasta la ciudad de San Francisco, pues es ah\u00ed donde vende sus productos. Ya que las plagas aquejan sus sembr\u00edos, Honorata comprar\u00e1 con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado tramperas para combatir  los insectos quienes se apoderan de los frutos de las plantas. Para el bien de su futuro espera  cuidar con el mismo \u00edmpetu sus parcelas. Este ser\u00e1 su 17avo cr\u00e9dito de Honorata con MFP,  por tanto espera de un peque\u00f1o apoyo de los financistas para llevar consigo su prop\u00f3sito y por ello esta apta en devolver todo sus aportes puntualmente como en sus anteriores cr\u00e9ditos, en su banco comunal es una socia muy solidaria con el resto  de las socias. Con los 2,000 mil nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 mallas que utilizar\u00e1 como trampas, para combatir con la plaga de insectos que asechan sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"Honorata, 48, is from the city of Quimbiri.  She is a hard-working woman who lives in her own house with her husband, Alejandro, 54, and their three minor children for whom they want to provide the best quality of life.  Together with her husband, Honorata works every day on her land.  With much effort she has been able to make her land more productive.  She grows a little bit of everything and produces quality crops, the mains ones being cocoa and coffee since these command the highest price at market.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is caring for her crops against insect plagues since this would reduce profits.  She has been in this trade for 20 years and feels the hardest part of it is transporting the crops to the city of San Francisco which is where she sells them.  Since plagues are a menace to the crops, Honorata will use the loan to buy wire netting to combat the insects.  She plans to care for all of her cropland in the same way to protect her future.  This is her 17th loan through MFP and she is counting on lenders to help her meet her goal.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time as she has done with previous loans.  She is a very supportive member of her communal bank.  With this 2,000 PEN loan she will buy wire netting to combat the insect plagues threatening her crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":848981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy several meters of wire netting.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-20T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712779}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T14:58:58Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":331213,"name":"Consuelo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Consuelo, de 42 a\u00f1os es madre de tres hijos a\u00fan menores quienes viven en su casa propia junto a su esposo con quien tuvo que trabajar mucho para poder obtener una vivienda propia.El trabajo de consuelo consiste en realizar compras del mercado al por mayo, despu\u00e9s ella lleva los productos a su casa para poder venderlos poni\u00e9ndolo un valor agregado, esta actividad la realiza en su casa.

In actuality, it really depends on the demand in the market.\r\n\r\n<P>The women of De La Buena Esperanza had previously requested a loan from Friendship Bridge. They believe that receiving a loan is a great idea because it helps them greatly in their business being that this loan is one of the few - if not the only - source of credit to which they have had access.\r\n\r\n<P>Some of them believe that a loan is a tool they can use to, one, come out of poverty, and two, gain a certain independence. This is due to the fact that when they invest the loan in their business, and it grows along with its utility, the women will have extra income for them to invest or spend at their disposition. \r\n\r\n<P>However, the battle to escape poverty is long and harsh. For the time being, the women must earn enough to cover their families\u2019 baS. needs. They mentioned that covering their household\u2019s baS. expenses was the most difficult for them.\r\n\r\n<P>Through Kiva, you can help these women fight against poverty. Please support them in their fight! \r\n \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P> \r\n<P>Cada tres semanas los d\u00edas lunes las mujeres De la Buena Esperanza se juntan en la comunidad de Barranche para asistir a las reuniones de repago o de ahorro de Friendship Bridge. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras se dedican mayormente a la crianza de animales. La crianza de pollos, cerdos y toros es un buen negocio. Algunas se\u00f1oras se dedican exclusivamente a la crianza de pollos, mientras que otras combinan la crianza de distintos animales. Realmente, depende de la demanda del mercado. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres De la Buena Esperanza ya hab\u00edan solicitado un cr\u00e9dito anteriormente con Friendship Bridge. Ellas piensan que solicitar un cr\u00e9dito es una gran idea porque las ayuda mucho en su negocio, ya que este cr\u00e9dito es una de las muy pocas, sino lo \u00fanica, fuente de cr\u00e9dito a las cual ellas han tenido acceso. \r\n\r\n<P>Algunas piensan que el cr\u00e9dito es una herramienta que ellas utilizan para, uno salir de la pobreza y dos para ganar cierta independencia. Esto se debe a que cuando ellas invierten el cr\u00e9dito en su negocio y este crece al igual que sus utilidades, las se\u00f1oras van a tener un dinero extra que ellas pueden invertir o gastar a su disposici\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n<P>Sin embargo, la lucha de salir de la pobreza es dura y larga. Por el momento, las se\u00f1oras tienen que ganar lo suficiente para cubrir las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de su familia.

So as to get into active life, she decided to find a business that would allow her to earn money. After a period of apprenticeship with her mother, she decided 15 years ago to specialize in selling embroidered and Wax-style \"pagnes\" (lengths of colorful African cloth that are very much in demand in West Africa). She is well-known and very good at her specialty of wearing apparel, and her shop is frequently visited by girls and young ladies of the town of  S\u00e9gou.<P>\r\n\r\nIn order to keep up with the competition in this sector and to maintain her ever-growing clientele, she decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. After having repaid 4 solidarity loans (group loans) with an association in her neighborhood, she is presently on her third individual loan. All the preceding loans have been correctly reimbursed. <P>\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 50 lengths of embroidered pagnes and 5 lengths of \"uni wax\" pagnes. She does her buying in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) from wholesalers at the big open-air market. Mrs. Assa H. sells her items for cash and on credit to a clientele essentially composed of women and a few men. <P>\r\n\r\nShe intends to make a monthly profit of 30,000 F CFA which will be used to add to her working capital and to help her spouse with the family expenses. Her ambition is to have a family home so as to be able to move out of that neighborhood. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

What she most desires is to succeed in life.  Each day, very early in the morning, she opens the doors to her grocery store to tend to her customers.  She is a persuasive saleswoman, and always manages to convince patrons to take something home with them.  Her store is very busy, as it\u2019s the best stocked in the neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is chatting with customers, which is how she finds out what\u2019s going on in the area.  She has been running her store for 10 years, and finds staying in the store all day without being able to go out to be the most challenging part about her business.  In the future, she hopes to make improvements to the space in which her store is located.\r\n\r\nThis is Amanda\u2019s fifth loan with MFP, and she is very grateful for the opportunity and promises to make all her payments on time, as she would like to continue having access to credit in the future.  She is one of the most respected members of her cooperative bank since she helps keep the group organized.  She plans to use the 1,500.00 Peruvian soles she is requesting to buy more products to better supply her grocery store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":449772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-16T12:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734939},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":252.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124262},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960003},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992848},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":252.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717636},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751322}],"funded_date":"2009-12-17T20:36:15Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":166735,"name":"Ton","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ton Y. was born in 1968 and has been married many years to Mr. Bunheang, age 49.

The association was founded in 1993 by 20 female entrepreneurs in order to increase their purchasing power by means of a \"tontine\" (a revolving fincance system whereby each member contributes an agreed amount periodically and this is passed on in rotation to different members). \r\n\r\nSince this policy does not allow all members to get funding at the same time, they decided to join the IMCEC in order to obtain a loan without being asked for guarantees. For this reason the members divided into sub-groups of five, with each of these sub-groups designating a president and a treasurer. These sub-groups, which all carry the name Takku Liggey in the Medina Fall savings institution, can retain the same members for numerous years, but often the members do change because of financing needs and other considerations. The AFDE organises members' meetings on a monthly basis where all sub-groups and branches are convened, and it also runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other products at preferential prices. \r\n\r\nThe AFDE is led by a president, whose name is Mrs Diarra MAR and a treasurer, Mrs.Nedeye Ndella D., both residents of Thi\u00e8s. The sub-group, Takku Liggey No. 28 is run by Mrs. Mame Bousso Baye, who is 29 years old. This woman, who has four children, has been a door-to-door saleswoman for two years. She sells pagnes (West African colourful fabric), sheets, pearls and incense to her customers. She has been influenced in this trade by a friend of her father who encouraged her and helped her to sell her products outside Thi\u00e8s. With this loan she is planning to get supplies of products (incense, pearls, sheets) in order to strengthen her activity. She participates in the sub-group with: \r\n- Mrs. Khoudia S., the treasurer, who sells \"bine-bine\" pearls, sheets, and incense which she has inherited from her mother\r\n- Mrs. Awa T., who sells washing powder\r\n- Mrs Khady D., who is active in trading peanut, ni\u00e9b\u00e9 beans and bissap (a refreshing drink made from hibiscus flowers).  \r\n- Mrs. Awa F., who also sells \"bine bine

They live in the Santa Rosa community, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own house.  Before adversity hit, he always forged ahead and his goal was to establish his own business over time.  Later, he started to produce cacao on a small parcel of land and sold everything he harvested to retailers.  Despite this, however, he did not feel content because they paid little and required a long-term commitment.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he produces cacao, coffee and coca leaves, and he acknowledges that he has a large customer base.  In addition, his sales have grown in a consistent manner.  He generally sells his merchandise in the areas near where he lives, and counts on the help of his laborers to help him with his agricultural endeavors.  His future aspirations are ambitious, to the point where he would like to expand his harvest lands into other localities in order to capture new customers.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, and he thanks the institution for the access to credit that they facilitate and commits to fulfilling his payment obligations.

The focus of this description will be the story of Sra. Yolanda N. H., the group representative.  She is 30 years old and married to her husband Pedro.  They still do not have children.  Yolanda sells tamales, meat enchiladas, and chorizo sausage.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda decided to pursue this business of the great demand that exists.  She only sells from home and is able to generate good earnings since she has many customers.  Yolanda has already been in business for five years and will invest her loan in the purchase of more ingredients used in making her products.  Tomatoes, chili peppers, garlic, banaN. leaves, condiments, and meat are the items that she needs the most.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith the profits from her business, Yolanda is saving toward the construction of a security wall around her house.  She also supports her husband with maintaining their household since they have many expenses between the two of them.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe says that her business is a benefit to the neighbors in her area since there are few people who sell locally. All of the vendors sell at the market, so she takes advantage of the few residents who do not like to travel to the center of town.  In addition to being close to her neighbors, she is known for the attention and service that she provides.  Do\u00f1a Yolanda dreams of adding a space to her house where she can open a butcher shop.  She also wants to have children.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda says the members of her group are very responsible people who complete their payments on time.  They know one another and get along very well.  She is extremely grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for their support by providing this loan.  Her business is improving as a result of this assistance.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the Cuahutemoc Group and their business activities are listed below:\r\n\u2022\tYolanda N.

Mary Rose is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mary Rose joined Kiva partner ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Kholik is dedicated to agriculture and the sale of cultivated vegetables, which means that he can be around his family, helping to raise their quality of life and educate all his five children. Kholik has been characterized as a person who is hard-working, since he has been working in agriculture since he was very young. This kind of work requires effort, dedication and above all, strength, as it can include heavy work, meaning that people get tired quickly. \r\n\r\nIn spite of this, Kholik is determined to raise the standard of living in his family and to improve the quality of the seeds he cultivates. For this reason, he is asking for help in order to be able to receive more credit from IMON International.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married and has four children, two of whom are in school.  \r\n\r\nAlex has a business of selling milk. She has been in this business for over 10 years, and she works seven days out of every week. Alex sells her products door-to-door.    \r\n\r\nAlex has requested a loan of 700,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more jerrycans of milk. She also generates additional income through poultry farming.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store, a motorcycle transport business and a farm. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Robert Glenn E., who is 34 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. \r\n\r\nThey have two children who are 1 and 6 years old. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs. \r\n\r\nRosalie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
