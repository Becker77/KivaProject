woman named Meriam A. lives. She is 46 years old and married to Juanito, a devoted and brave fisherman. The couple was blessed with two children and both of them have settled down.\r\n\r\nMr. Juanito once worked with their neighbor who had a fishing boat. He had a small share of the fishing income, but it was not enough for the whole family. Meriam happened to become a Paglaum Co-op member when one of their neighbors (a co-op member too) sold the couple Paglaum\u2019s programs and services five years ago. The couple was so thankful for Paglaum because they were granted enough money to purchase machinery for their own fishing boat. From then on, Meriam's husband no longer worked with their neighbor, but focused on his own fishing boat and has reaped their income from it. While her husband is focusing on fishing, Mrs. A. is also vending snacks, ice candy, ice, and bar-b-que in their neighborhood to provide additional income for the family. Bar- b-que is a kind of thinly sliced pork or any meat attached to a bamboo stick and grilled. It has a minimal selling price of only two to five pesos and is very affordable to the market.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the couple has acquired three unit motorized pump boats and is applying for a loan worth fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00) for the acquisition of another fishing boat which is bigger and better than what they have now.  According to them, the bigger the boat is, the more it can fight big waves, can run through even during stormy season, and can transport and hold a number of huge fish caught at sea. An average of fifty kilos per day is their daily sales from one unit motorized pump boat, with an average of forty pesos (P40) selling price per kilo, depending on the type and variety of fish. \r\n\r\nThe couple was so grateful for Paglaum MPC because through the co-op they were able to build a partially concrete house. The couple hopes for more blessings to come as they faithfully maintain their Member In Good Standing status with the co-op and pay their loans on time with no trace of default. The family is dreaming of having a \u201clantsa\u201d, a much bigger fishing boat with at least 20 workers so that they can fish from coast to coast in the

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use

Despite the fact that her work is full of sacrifice, she assures us that thanks to agriculture she can cover expenses for her home, such as furnishing it, to have a better quality of life for her family.

Thi Luu's family only focused on farming and small retail activities, thus, her family was very poor as she and her husband had just started to live separately from their parents. In 1995, she joined the Fund and borrowed 500.000VND (about 32USD) to invest in buying and selling general goods. She realised that it was easy to repay the loan weekly and that she had more capital for her business. Therefore, she used the subsequent loans to move into butchering. Her husband selected and butchered the pigs while Mrs. Luu sold the pork at the wet market. She also catered for offices and restaurants, so her annual income reached hundreds of millions VND. In 2005, she used the profits from the butcher shop and borrowed more money to build a spacious 2-storey house. Currently, she is still concentrating on the butcher shop and caters for the restaurant in Noi Bai airport. Her family's monthly income is about 8,000,000VND (about 515USD). This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150.00USD) to invest in her butcher shop.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia Q\u0169y T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p v\u00e0 bu\u00f4n b\u00e1n nh\u1ecf l\u1ebb, khi \u0111\u00f3 kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh r\u1ea5t kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n v\u00ec hai v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng m\u1edbi \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c b\u1ed1 m\u1eb9 cho ra \u1edf ri\u00eang.

Her business is toy sales, adjusting the items she carries according to the time of year and special national holidays. The stand she occupies is rented space. It is located in the market, the most visited market in the district. All her sales are finalized in cash only. She pays special attention to cordiality and customer service, which is why her sales are always so good. She has been at this business for the past 6 years and she loves doing what she does.  She is able to employ her daughter as help to carry out sales. Her greatest dream is to finish building a stand in a different market so that they can move their business.

Mamerta S., age 61, still has something to live for even without her husband at her side any more. Maita, as she is called by fellow community partners in CCT*, reached high school level during her educational years; at present, she devotes her time to running her own small business. She has her seven children to continue living for. Maita\u2019s family resides in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nA sari-sari (variety) store serves as Maita\u2019s main source of income. With it, she strives to meet the immediate needs of her community as she makes every effort to earn income for her family. The store is residential and is thus accessible to the family. Maita has been running a sari-sari store for 25 years now; she did so even when her husband Valentin, also a vendor, was still living. Monthly, Maita earns Php 12,000 on average.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Maita loans Php 10,000. She will make good use of the loan by purchasing products that are in demand in their location, such as the vinegar and coal used by some families to prepare their meals. Maita says the loan also enables her to give to family members when an emergency arises. \r\n\r\nThe challenge Maita has to face is the selling of products that are not much in demand, such as canned goods. People in her community are not much into buying these goods, as they prefer cooking their own meals. But one good thing is that Maita can focus on making her business efficient, as she currently has no significant personal problems. She desires to make her business more profitable in order to be able to help others. She hopes that her sari-sari store will grow into a grocery, so that she will be able to renovate her commercial space as well as their house. Most of all, she prays that her children will become successful and have their own growing businesses.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":721311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase such items as coal and vinegar for retail sale in her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-26T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamerta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2193.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814282},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256854},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123547},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194874}],"funded_date":"2011-02-26T17:34:23Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":281689,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cAMAUTA\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urubamba, provincia de Urubamba, departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra: Ana; La socia tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, y tiene 2 hijos, (20,17); la socia es comerciante minorista, la socia vende productos de belleza por cat\u00e1logos, ella tiene un peque\u00f1o almac\u00e9n en casa en el cual ella almacena los productos de belleza que la socia compra en oferta para despu\u00e9s de un tiempo poderlos ofrecer a un poco mas y como deja en dos partes el producto, las clientes que tiene le compran; la socia tambi\u00e9n viaja y trae ropa de la cuidad de Lima, ella vende todo tipo de ropa; La socia requiere el cr\u00e9dito para comprar ropa y productos de belleza para la venta.

She started in the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo more than 15 years ago and has received 22 loans. Her first activity was realted to a small business selling merchandise via catalogues, or specialized product guides. Then, inspired by her parents activities, also a part of the Foundation's programs, she added the activity of selling beverages such as beer from a small cooler. She still has the cooler and has added making frozen food. These activities continue generating her income and she dreams of making them grow more every day to continue improving her quality of life. At present, her small freezer is not in the best condition and she needs to replace it soon. That is why she is turning to Kiva loans to buy a new cooler to go from small scale beer selling to providing a larger quantity for stores and other establishments. Her dream is to buy her own house, because at present she lives in her parent's house. They have always supported her in all of the things she has done in life.

He is married and is the father of three children whose ages average 10 years, all of whom attend school.  In addition to supporting his family, he has two dependent nephews.  He studied until fifth grade, having had to stop school due to his economic and social situation.  He lives with his family in his own house.\r\n\r\nArmindo left Inhembane in 1988 for Maputo, and five years later left the city of Maputo for Boane, where he still lives today with his wife, his children and his nephews.  Having arrived in the area in 1993, he began a business selling locally available construction material (capim - a type of grass), having more than three years of experience selling this type of material.  A sheaf of capim sells for 4,003 MT.  It's very difficult to acquire this material at times, because the capim dries out.\r\n\r\nThe business yields 4,000 MT, with which he manages to support his family and save some money through a traditional savings system (xitique).  This is his second loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 12,000 MT to purchase construction materials for cabins and other types of tourist complexes.  The first loan was for 15,000 MT, also for the same purpose.  \r\n\r\nHe got to know Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution.  He has never had a loan with another institution, and with the present loan he plans to acquire more raw materials and to be able to employ more people to help in the collection or procurement of material.\r\n\r\nArmindo proposes to pay back the loan as quickly as possible, without problems, in order to be able to obtain other loans for the purpose of constructing an oven for manufacturing bread.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

He started his business to provide affordable and quality work to residents of New Orleans and has since moved to the commercial and industrial sectors. Five years ago, Damion had to shut down his business after Hurricane Katrina hit the Louisiana coast. Through perserverence and hard work, Damion was able to pull his business together. There was fewer work with fewer people in New Orleans, and also, less people willing to invest in their homes. For people who needed renovation, many unlicensed contractors came to New Orleans and took advantage of that demand. All these factors contributed to making it very difficult for Damion to build his business back up again.\r\n\r\nThis same situation has happened again with the recent oil spill. Damion had seven large residential projects planned before the oil spill that would have brought almost $ 1 million to his company. However, because of the oil spill devastating the area, investors were not as willing to invest in these homes and decided to not go through with the projects. Damion and his 15 employees had been counting on those projects and now he does not have enough money to tide the business over until they get their next big project, which is currently under way. With this loan, Damion plans to  pay his employees and rent big machinery. Without this loan, Damion would not be able to complete this big project and would be forced to let go of some of his employees.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5250,"image":{"id":621461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"New

This is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support.  She is pleased to be part of a communal bank, because all of the members are reliable and responsible.  She thanks all those who will manage the loan she is requesting, because it will be very useful in growing her business.

She lives in Rizal, Palawan. \r\n\r\nSylvia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past second loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sylvia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000,  uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third cycle loan, Sylvia is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy additional goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Sylvia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

There she formed her family together with Rub\u00e9n, her husband of eight years.  The couple have five children who they care for in their own home.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 14 years old, Viviana started taking on responsibility as she was expecting her first child.  This motivated her to start her own business so that she could financially support her family.  Farming, an activity she has known since she was a child, helped her to get ahead.  She grows coffee, annatto and cassava.  Viviana grows these crops on her own farmland.  She tells us that she used to rent large tracts of land but, over time and with her husband's help, she managed to buy a plot of land of her own.  What Viviana most enjoys is selling her crops each season as there is a lot of interaction involved.  Her cheerfulness and experience help her to make good profits.  In addition, Viviana raises hens which she fattens and then sells in order to make extra money.  Her current plans are to grow a larger quantity of coffee so that she can enjoy an extremely productive year this coming year.\r\n\r\nViviana is a member of the 'Los Amigos Cafetaleros' community bank and this is her second loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your help so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time.  With your support, Viviana will invest the money she has requested in buying coffee plants and natural fertilizers for her next sowing period."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":888332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee plants and sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T14:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400691}],"funded_date":"2011-10-07T17:00:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":347300,"name":"Hadjah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadjah lives in Uganda.

Currently there are many traveling buyers that purchases cacao directly from farmers.  Many farmers are planting cacao trees in their fields as it provides quick production turnaround and easy to take care of.  Ni Wayan Warni does not want to compete directly with other traveling traders, she decided to enter the cacao drying business.  \r\n\r\nNi Wayan Warni plans to use the loan from DInari to purchase scales and cacao nuts from traders.  These cacao nuts are then sold to wholesalers that comes to her home once a week.  At this time, dry cacao trades at $1.20 to $ 1.45 per kilograms.  Ni Wayan Warni can get profit of up to 5 to 11 cents per kilogram.  In one transaction Ni Wayan Warni can purchase 100 kg Cacao nuts and resell it to the wholesaler.  So Ni Wayan Warni can gain $11 profit per transaction (once a week).\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nNi Wayan Y., 51 tahun, melihat peluang yang baik di desanya. Saat ini banyak pembeli biji kakao keliling yang membeli kakao langsung ke petani. Memang petani sekarang ini banyak menanami sawahnya dengan pohon kakao karena perawatannya mudah dan cepat mendapat hasil. Karena tidak ingin bersaing dengan pedagang keliling yang lain, Ni Wayan Y. melihat peluang ini untuk menekuni usaha Pengepul Biji Kakao.\r\nDengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Made Y. menggunakannya untuk membeli timbangan dan biji kakao dari pedagang keliling. Biji kakao ini akan dijual kembali kepada pedagang besar yang datang ke rumahnya seminggu sekali. Saat ini biji kakao kering berharga Rp. 11.000.- sampai dengan Rp. 13.000.- per kilogram. Ni Made Y. bisa mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.- sampai dengan Rp. 1.000.- per kilogram. Dalam satu transaksi, Ni Wayan Y. bisa membeli 100 kilogram biji kakao dan menjualnya kembali ke pedagang besar. Jadi Ni Wayan Y. bisa mendapat keuntungan Rp. 100.000.- per transaksi ( 1 minggu sekali

They have 2 young children who attend school so the expenses add up. So when TYM started operating in her area, she and her husband had decided to borrow money to invest in a butcher stand. In the beginning, their sales were small. Since they buy their beef directly from supplier they were able to make good profit. Sales had increased and they have been able to save money. With subsequent loans from TYM, they invested in their butcher shop. Now their financial difficulty is over, they can assure good education for their children.

La agricultura es parte de las buenas costumbres que le heredaron sus padres, en todo este tiempo ha tratado de sembrar mayor cantidad arvejas y habas, aunque \u00e9stas en menor cantidad por ser de menor ganancia. Ra\u00fal procura alquilar chacras donde ya hayan crecido papas anteriormente, esto facilita la siembra de arvejas, ya que de un saco de granos de arvejas, llega a cosechar de 50 a 60 sacos, esto lo realiza 3 veces como m\u00e1ximo en la misma chacra. Pero no todo es bueno, ya que Ra\u00fal en ciertas oportunidades se ve amenazado por las plagas que se implantan en las chacras por la excesiva lluvia, y tambien la helada (clima helado), sabiendo que si la rancha ataca a sus cultivos, se puede contrarrestar con funguicidas y pesticidas, pero con la helada no hay soluci\u00f3n alguna para salvar los cultivos. Ra\u00fal est\u00e1 muy feliz con sus cultivos de arvejas, pese a las dificultades que tiene, los precios lo alientan a seguir sembrando, ya que son muy rentables para \u00e9l. \u00c9l es secretario de su banco comunal, en cada una de las reuniones est\u00e1 encargado de redactar todos los acuerdos, este es su 2do pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo viene pagando puntualmente sus cuotas.

Farming is part of the good habits he inherited from his parents, he has always tried to grow a large quantity of peas and beans, even though these in smaller quantity products smaller profits. Ra\u00fal was able to rent farms where they previously grew potatoes, and this facilitated growing peas, as from one sack of pea seeds he can harvest 50-60 sacks, and this he does at the most 3 times on the same farmland. But not all is well, as Ra\u00fal has been threatened by various plagues on his fields because of excessive rain, and also frost (in this cold climate), knowing that if a pestilence attacks his crops, he can use fungicides and pesticides, but with the frost there isn\u2019t a way to save his crops. Ra\u00fal is very happy with his pea crops, despite the difficulties that he has, the prices support him continuing to grow this crop as they are very profitable for him.

Her children are what motivate her.  She has been learning to raise cattle her whole life.  She learned this work from her parents, who worked hard to give her a good life, when she was a small girl.  She brings her cattle to the Sunday fair in the Huancan\u00e9 neighborhood, where she gets a good price since her livestock are the biggest and strongest at the fair due to the good care she gives them.   She's been doing this for 6 years and what she likes most is feeding her animals.  In the future, she hopes to be able to increase the number of cattle she has and in this way improve her income.  The most difficult thing for Josefa is transferring her cattle to the fair because it's very tiring and slow. But she knows that she has to do it and is happy to work hard, hoping to reach her goals. This is Josefa's first loan with MFP and she's aware of the responsibility she has to pay it on time, even though she will have to save bit by bit to do it.

She currently sells fabrics by special order and distributes them, often on credit, to her customers.  She has already had a loan with Alid\u00e9 and has repaid it.  She has need of funding for boosting her working capital, in order to satisfy all the orders she receives for cloth.  This is why she\u2019s requesting a second loan from Alid\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":339724,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy twenty 5-meter bolts of damask cloth ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-06-23T00:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philom\u00e8ne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126480},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549906},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983697},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896066},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735646},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623157},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019862},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858356},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618514},{"amount":55,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25938.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144652602}],"funded_date":"2009-06-23T02:46:19Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":121070,"name":"Nasipa's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nasipa is the leader of this group.

Together with her partner, she tries to proviD. them with all the comforts for their progress.  She dedicates herself to selling fruits and vegetables at the market in her locality, where she has been working for six months.  In this time, she has managed to attain a stall that she rents, as this is the only way to start her business within the market.  Since then, she has carried out her activities with great enthusiasm every day from six in the morning until four in the afternoon, taking advantage of the demand there is for her product in the early part of the day.  Despite this, in order to make her business profitable, she has to offer quality products and good customer service -- important factors for her clients.  Bernardina has always characterized herself for being very friendly, and this has helped her to increase her customer base.  Regardless, the effort she has maD. to rent a stall for her work is proving to be quite expensive, since the cost of her space cuts into the profits from her sales.  Bernardina hopes that they will re-lease the space to her so she can grow her business and have her own place from which to sell her product.

Her place of business is in the \"Laguna Temporal\" esplanade (site of Juliaca's fairs).  She sells artisanal weavings and her designs are very unique because she herself weaves them.  What she most likes about her work is the weaving and the more she does it the better she feels.  Besides, this is a way for her to earn money to pay for her childrens' schooling.  She has had this occupation for 3 years and considers the most difficult part of it is having to carry her wares to her sales stall because she lives far away.  Her future plans are to save enough money to set up a shop where she can sell her wares more peacefully.  This is Felicitas' third loan with MFP and she is very punctual with her payments because she does not want to cause her communal bank any inconveniences; she is very comfortable in it and knows that it will help her to get ahead.

He brings the wood on orders from the jungle in Puerto Maldonado to the city of Cusco to sell. \n\nSr. Tito is grateful for and values the opportunity given to him through this loan and is committed to paying it back in a timely fashion. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Eldridge, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":475007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tipon - Cusco - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tito Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":226.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":235.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":244.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":254.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":264.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":275.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.32},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":226.15,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":227.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872650},{"amount":82.32,"local_amount":235.19,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":236.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905903},{"amount":85.61,"local_amount":244.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":246.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633373},{"amount":89.04,"local_amount":254.4,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":255.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667795},{"amount":92.59,"local_amount":264.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":266.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851509},{"amount":96.29,"local_amount":275.05,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":276.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589869}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T03:28:12Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":174730,"name":"Las Momostecas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo de se\u00f1oras,  del paraje Pologu\u00e1 de la Aldea San Antonio Pasajoc, municipio de  Momostenango  departamento de  Totonicap\u00e1n, son personas que se conocen, desde hace 5 a\u00f1os han trabajado siempre juntas, en diferentes actividades que se organizan dentro de la comunidad Como por ejemplo Comit\u00e9 de Escuelas en donde estudian sus hijos actividades de la Iglesia en el cual lo integran de la siguiente manera: se cuenta con una justa directiva la cual tienen a su presidenta, Secretaria,  Tesorera: y  la dem\u00e1s son Vocales.

It was a very difficult time for her because all the responsibilities were shifted onto her shoulders, but she recovered herself and fought through the circumstances very bravely. She started an embroidery business because in Multan people like to wear embroider clothes in normal routine.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buy and sell of native materials and a banana & coconut business.  She has five children who are 11 to 31 years old.  Gloria  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gloria  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and the needs of her family.  Gloria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married, and from this marriage she has two children, 20 and 21 years old. She lives in her own house where she spends her days at the side of her two children and her husband, with whom she worked hard in order to be able to provide the best to her children. Now she is providing them an education, and for that reason she and her husband work every day so they don't lack for anything. Gredel works selling various products; among the things she sells are beauty products, perfume, cosmetics, and more, as well as fashionable clothing that she brings from the city of Lima and sells on credit to her friends, neighbors, family members, and coworkers. In addition to this, she is also a teacher at an educational center in the city. She has been doing this work for 18 years, and it is going very well for her. She started with it when she needed to be able to cover the cost of her studies, since she was still a student then and needed to have some income. Little by little she made progress until she graduated and was able to also work in the area she had studied. Even so, she continued selling cosmetics, since they bring her a good income. She has many plans for the future. She hopes to be able to continue working and creating a good income for her household, but for the moment she will bring in more products and in this way begin to expand her business. This will be her first loan with MFP, so she hopes for your collaboration so that she can realize her plans. On the other hand, she promises to make her repayments on time, and she hopes to quickly develop a good relationship with her communal bank, of which she has heard very good things due to the comradeship and solidarity that exists among its members. With the amount requested of 1000 soles, she will buy beauty products, cosmetics, and perfume in order to sell them, as well as some clothing to offer to her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":939088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cosmetics and clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-07T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gredel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":154.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":151.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":164.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":171.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":174.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":183.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.07,"local_amount":154.86,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":156.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836289},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":151.25,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":152.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246050},{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":164.92,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":166.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386070},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":171.07,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":173.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099159},{"amount":65.27,"local_amount":174.06,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":176.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713314},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":183.84,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":185.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202195}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T06:43:36Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":371909,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith lives in Changamwe, Kenya.

crecimiento de su hijo, ya que es madre soltera y vive con su \u00fanico hijo en su casa, trabajando con mucho esmero por brindarle lo mejor. Desde muy joven se dedic\u00f3 a la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y siempre ha tratado de brindar lo mejor de su trabajo, reflejo de esta dedicaci\u00f3n es el cargo de empresaria que tiene dentro de la l\u00ednea de belleza. Por esto, tiene como responsabilidad trabajar con un grupo de j\u00f3venes muchachas a quienes orienta y ayuda para que logren sus metas de ventas. Esta actividad la realiza todo el d\u00eda, tratando siempre de tener un espacio de descanso para estar con su hijo, siendo lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil las horas de supervisi\u00f3n que realiza por las tardes, pues tiene que verificar la cantidad de los pedidos que se realizan. Ahora, Hortencia tiene proyectado abrir un bazar en su casa, donde instale vitrinas para exhibir sus productos e incrementar sus ingresos, sin salir de su hogar. Los 6 cr\u00e9ditos que tiene con Microfinanzas PRISMA le han permitido mejorar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos, pero sobre todo, le ayudaron a mejorar su trabajo como miembro activo de su banco comunal, el cual se form\u00f3 hace 3 a\u00f1os. Los 1800 soles que solicita ser\u00e1n invertidos en la compra de vitrinas para colocar sus productos y para adquirir mayor cantidad de productos de belleza.","en":"Hortencia is 49 years old. As any mother, her priority is the development and growth of her son. Since she is a single mother and lives with her only son, she is committed to work very hard to provide him with the best. \r\n\r\nShe has been selling cosmetics since a very young age and has always sought to do the best she can. This determination reflects in the responsibilities that she assumes in the cosmetics line. For that reason she is in charge of a group of young girls to whom she gives guidance on the best way to achieve their sales objectives. She performs this activity throughout the day, always trying to take a break to be with her son. Her greatest difficulty is the supervision time in the evening when she must check the placed orders. Now Hortencia plans to open a store in her home, where she will install showcases to display her products and increase her income without leaving her home.\r\n\t\r\nThe six loans that she has had with Microfinanzas Prisma have enabled her to increase her income, but above all they have helped her to improve her work as an active member of her community bank, which was formed three years ago. Hortencia will invest the 1800 nuevos soles of her loan in showcases to place her merchandise and in more cosmetics. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva

Their children are 6, 5 and 3 years old respectively.  They live together in their own home in the Santa Rosa neighborhood of the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle.  When she was very young, Irene's parents suffered a decline in their agricultural production.  Because of that, their income was reduced to the point that they didn't even have food to eat.  With time, they ventured into the area of carpentry, and they managed to survive.  Currently, her partner helps her in all aspects, and due to their tireless efforts, they were granted their reward.  Today their workshop, where they sell a wide variety of furniture that they make themselves, is well positioned in their neighborhood. Because of that, they earn a good profit, compared with earlier years.  Irene recognizes that the key componenet of their success is their love of the work.  She normally works with her husband, and together they make a good team, but at times they need additional workers to speed up the fabrication of the furniture.  Their daily routine starts at 8:00 in the morning and lasts until 8:00 at night.  Their point of sale is in the same nieghborhood they live in.

She makes beautiful embroidered clothes and supplies them to different shops and other boutiques. She does this business to financially support her family.

Her eldest son works in a private company for meager income. Another son has a mobile shop in the market. He sells different mobile phones and accessories to his customers. Her youngest son is studying in 6th class. \r\n\r\nSurriya has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the betterment of her boutique business. With the loan, she will buy embroidery items such as beads, colored thread, clothes and sketches in bulk quantity, which will help her to make more embroidered dresses to serve more clients. She is hopeful that an investment will bring positive changes to her boutique business and she will increase her household income. She is a new loan applicant of Asasah and this is her first loan application.

Poblacion, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling scrap materials and sacks and selling soft and hard drinks. She has five children, who range in age from 10 to 31 years. \r\n\r\nFlorida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon helped her earn a monthly income of 33,000 Philippines pesos (PHP), uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she could continue to save up for the future security of her family. Florida B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a food or vegetables stall, a carinderia (small eatery) and a tricycle transport business.  Her husband Renato, who is 47 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are 13 to 35 years old.  Jessie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 26 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jessie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  Great sales at the Caravalan market for vegetable produce are on Wednesday and Saturday. This time, for her 27th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to use to buy stock for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs.  Jessie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a member of the solidarity group called \u201cFive 2\u201d. She is married and her husband is a farmer. She has two children and together they live in the El Cinco Community in the Olanchito municipality. For the past two years Maria has sold clothes and sandals. She learned the business thanks to one of her friends, who is in the same business. Her friend recommended that Maria buy the necessary supplies, which the company sold to her at a good price. Her business doesn\u2019t have a name, as she is a roving salesperson. Early in the morning she begins selling in the streets of their community and in neighboring communities. Her main difficulty is not the weather, as even if it is raining or hot she always goes out to try to earn sales in order to support her family. Maria is asking for this loan in order to buy a variety of clothes for children, women and men. She wants to buy the latest styles and clothes for the rainy climate.

is 44 years old and a mother of four.  She used to work hard to sell groceries, which also generated no income because there was no big supply and demand for these products in her city.  Three years ago, she gave up selling  groceries.  Now, she sells clothing to various houses: she sells clothing seasonally, leaving her customers the products and getting paid at her next return visit.  She works in the same company her husband Juan Manuel works.  He is also responsible for the administration of bill collection from his customers every 30 days.   Teresa, like all mothers, wishes that her children become professionally successful.  That is why she works very hard with dedication to this job.  Currently, she has her own store which is not used because there are many repairs that need to be done to display her clothing.  With this goal to refurbish this place, establish her business, and sell her products, she seeks a loan to develop and utilize the space that she has.  With your help, Teresa will be able to materialize her goal in a short time.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nTeresa de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, madre  con cuatro hijos, se dedicaba a la venta de abarrotes, el mismo que  no lo produjo ning\u00fan ingreso econ\u00f3mico ya que existe una gran oferta y  demanda de estos productos en su ciudad; hace tres a\u00f1os dej\u00f3 la venta de abarrotes y ahora  se dedica a la venta de prendas de vestir a domicilio, \u00e9stas las ofrece deacuerdo a las temporadas dej\u00e1ndolas con un compromiso de pago a su retorno y pr\u00f3xima visita;  trabaja  en compa\u00f1\u00eda de  su esposo, Juan Manuel, quien tambi\u00e9n   se encarga de administrar los cobros que realizan sus clientes cada treinta d\u00edas..Teresa, como toda madre desea que sus hijos se conviertan en  profesionales exitosos,  y por esa raz\u00f3n  con mucho esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n se encamina m\u00e1s a fondo en esta labor.

For this reason, she is requesting a loan which will be used to purchase pork and add more menu items to her food business, and to be a retailer of electronic\/auto load sim cards.\r\n\r\nCatherine is 26 years old, and married to Antonio, who is a creative wood carver.
