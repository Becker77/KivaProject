H\u00e0 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H\u00e0 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.

She is a farmer who owns 1.5-hectares (3.75-acres) of land on which she cultivates rice to support her family living. Her husband, Mr. Saroeun Chhon, is a palm juice collector.\r\n\r\nIn the rice field, this family has a problem because their rice field has infertile soil.

Azagra, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by buying and selling rice.  Her husband, Rico, who is 52 years old, works as a laborer to earn a living.  They have five children, who are between the ages of 18 and 30 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLucena joined Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 16 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own hard work, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her last loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP enabled her to earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, which helped to improve her family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is seeking to borrow 10,000 PHP ($225), which she intends to use to purchase additional fertilizer and rice. In turn, she hopes to continue to save up so that she can purchase a tricycle and perform home repairs. Lucena A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, NWTF is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").  Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 per day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.  They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, which is a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

With the loan he\u2019ll purchase the spare parts for his microbus. With your support, Amin will continue to progress. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is married and has a grown son. He runs a small business providing personal vehicle owners and enthusiasts with vehicle related products. Currently, he has built up around $6,000 in working capital and has a monthly net profit of around $500. \r\n\r\nSergey is very knowledgeable and professional in his trade and relates well with his car-loving customers. He tries to conduct his business to provide a minimum hassle experience. Sergey has a talent for making every customer feel valued and appreciated, even after the sales process is complete. Many times he will offer after-sales help such as assisting with an installation. This also helps him stay competitive in a tough auto parts sales market. \r\n\r\nSergey would like to receive a loan of $1,200 for a couple purposes. First of all, he is planning to do some electrical improvements to his vending facility. Secondly, he would like to get a better supply of spare parts to sell, such as radiators, crankshafts, generators and starters for different types of vehicles. Sergey believes that good parts availability and reasonable prices will help many of his clients obtain the items they need and accomplish their repair goals, which will help him maintain his leading position in the market and continue to expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0456\u0439 \u2013 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0432

For 5 years of hard-working and constant studying, she and her husband have become experienced and used the loan more effectively.

The loan she is requesting from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir will go toward the purchase of fabric, thread, zippers, and all kinds of accessories to decorate dresses. She has three sewing machines, one for embroidering and the other for straight stitch and zigzag. She employs one person who is in charge of gem embroidery for wedding and quincea\u00f1era gowns. One wedding gown is worth 300 dollars, depending on what she has to invest in each one. Blanca's dream is to have a much bigger shop of operations, like purchasing a machine that makes bathing suits, which is something she lacks, in order to provide a better service and attract more customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":428870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabric, thread, zippers, and all kinds of accessories to decorate the dresses she makes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T04:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Enith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":440,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789471},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679974},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679975},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679976},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074511},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074512},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910507},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910508}],"funded_date":"2009-11-19T06:51:16Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":158671,"name":"Roman","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roman, trabaja como procurador realizando tramites legales de todo tipo.\nVive en la zona de miraflores de la Ciudad de La Paz, en casa alquilada.\nEl cr\u00e9dito ser\u00e1 destinado para educaci\u00f3n (pago de tutor, elaboraci\u00f3n de tesis, tramites en el ministerio de educaci\u00f3n y universidad, para obtener su titulo de abogado)\nEs la primera vez que solicita un cr\u00e9dito en Impro, las ganas de superarse le dan la oportunidad de obtener este cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Roman works as a lawyer doing legal procedures of all kinds.

She is 38 years old. Rosalie is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<P>\r\n\r\nRosalie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalie owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Rosalie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosalie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Rosalie is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Rosalie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<P>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her previous loan of PHP 27,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

She is a loving mother and lives with her husband and two children in her own home which she has just acquired.  For more than two years, Jovita has been knitting sweaters, using industrial yarn.  She does this work in her workshop which is located in her home.  She also makes other clothes with a variety of different threads and colors.  However, she has to keep moving her knitting machine to a different spot in her home to avoid people coming in and stealing it.\r\n\r\nJovita's days are spent making and knitting children's and adult's sweaters.  She sells these garments to her family members and friends in her neighborhood.  What she most likes about her work is that she enjoys her knitting and doesn't feel the hours rush past.  She also makes profits which help her to cover her household's expenses.

She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarisa hopes to bring her whole family closer to God. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

town of Churcampa, in Huancavelica, a Department of central Peru. Churcampa is the provincial capital, and is located at 3300 meters above sea level. The zone is chilly, with rugged terrain. Churcampa trades heavily with the nearby city of Huancayo. Most of the community members are involved in commerce, while some farm and raise livestock. Farmers grow corn in Chucuampa\u2019s low-elevation areas, and peas in higher elevation areas. <P>\r\n\r\nFelicitas and Cirila are two members of the \"Virgen D. las Mercedes\" group. Felicitas is married with five children: four of them are in their twenties, while the youngest is 13. Felicitas has a small restaurant, where she also sells sodas. She launched her business a year ago, when some local bank workers asked if she could cook them lunch. Felicitas\u2019 business is going well; the only problem is that it is hard to find time to plant crops on her farm since she is so busy with the restaurant. Loans from FINCA have helped her buy utensils and offer a wider variety of meals and drinks to sell. She plans to use this loan of 500 soles to buy more dry goods (rice, flour sugar) and sodas. Felicitas\u2019 goals for the future are to send her children to college and to expand her business even more. \r\n\r\nCirila is married with four children, who are 28, 24, 21 and 17 years old. She has a small general store that she hopes to expand. She has been running her store for 15 years now, and supports her children with the money she earns. She says that when there was a lot of societal violence in the area (in the 1980s and 1990s, due to conflicts between the armed forces and the Shining Path) it was hard to run the store; she could only stay open until 5pm, since staying open later was unsafe and would make her vulnerable to robberies. She plans to use her loan of 400 soles to improve her business and buy more equipment. Her dreams for the future are for her children to graduate with professional degrees and to open a wholesale dry goods business. Working with FINCA has helped her save money in her savings account, which she plans to use for any difficulties she may encounter in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":242771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy rice, flour, sugar, sodas, equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-21T17:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leoncia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodosia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1299.97},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1300.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":420.82,"local_amount":1299.97,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215302},{"amount":420.82,"local_amount":1299.97,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397010},{"amount":420.82,"local_amount":1299.97,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088686},{"amount":841.69,"local_amount":2600.09,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2602.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982045},{"amount":420.85,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1301.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442755}],"funded_date":"2008-12-24T05:15:44Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":84738,"name":"Irshad M.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

She earns her living by operating a fishing business. In addition to her business, she serves as reflexologist\/midwife in their community to earn additional income. Her husband Gil, who is 57 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 11 children who are between 16 and 36 years old. Wilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000 to buy fishing net and equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Wilma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It is noted for the fact that it is the only community for several kilometers that has a senior high school.  32 year-old Joselin L. is a teacher.  She is married and has two children who are in pre-school in the community.\r\n\r\nJoselin tells us that a little over a year ago she started her own business selling shoes through a catalog.  She sells shoes to her work colleagues, friends and neighbors in her community.  She takes the catalogs to her customers, fills in their orders, orders the products from her suppliers and, when the package arrives, she delivers her products and receives payment for them.  She decided to start working in her own business because the financial situation is becoming more and more difficult every day and money doesn't reach far enough.  She also wants to save for the future so that she can pay for her children to study towards a profession.\r\n\r\nJoselin needs this loan to invest in buying shoes and catalogs so that she can make her sales.  She tells us that she hopes this investment will help her business to grow and that she will gain more customers so that her sales and business grow.  In the future, she would like to set up a small shoe store in her community.  She hopes that she will be able to sell a lot because there is no other store of this kind in her community.\r\n\r\nJoselin is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for granting her this loan since it will help her not only in her business but also in providing her children with a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":760194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy footwear to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Arroyo de Pita, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T12:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joselin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1000.13,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160892},{"amount":218.74,"local_amount":2499.87,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233803},{"amount":175.01,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512622},{"amount":175,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223272},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":506.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201546}],"funded_date":"2011-04-29T23:54:06Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":298649,"name":"Conchita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Conchita B. is 66 years old and married.

Meet Erick, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 31-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of his family, with a wife and three children, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Litein, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past five years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop selling. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. <br \/><br \/>Erick passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and another quality breed of dairy cow. The dairy unit will assist Erick in managing his cows well and also protecting them from the harsh weather conditions. Erick also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 liters of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenyan Shillings per liter and through this loan he will be making more money. <br \/><br \/>Before Erick joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Erick now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into becoming self-reliant. With the loan, Erick will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Erick will achieve this. <br \/><br \/>An increase in income will allow Erick to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children. His dream is to continue improving his dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards.

It is the only source of income for her family. \r\n\r\nKaterina realizes the value of lending services which have promoted growth and contributed to the success of her small business. She has maintained a perfect credit history with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d, repaying a total of ten loans. Currently, she has built up around $2,000 of working capital. Her monthly gross profit amounts to $800.\r\n\r\nKaterina is requesting a loan of $1,000 to buy assorted inventory. She is planning to refresh her clothing supply with a variety of pajamas, t-shirts, socks and other clothing.

She is married with seven children who are between the ages of 13 and 30. \r\n\r\nNeema has been running a mgahawa business [local restaurant] since 2008. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to visit. The food is all-local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), plantains (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Neema currently earns about 96USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 300USD in order to renovate a her business place. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":271045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To renovate her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema A.

Miguel Tlacamama community, located about 10 kilometers from Pinotepa Nacional. They are all merchants. Many people in the region sell fresh cheeses, which is the case for Isidora Alberta C., who has sold them for five years. Her siblings split up the profits, since they are the ones who own the cows and make the product themselves. They give her a percentage of the profits when she goes to sell. Now, with the loan money, she will buy the product from her siblings and start her own small business. The product sells very well in the region and is considered an inexpensive basic necessity. With the supplies she obtains, she will keep investing in her cheese-selling business and continue purchasing pigs to fatten and sell them. She has done this activity for about eight years. She considers it part of her responsibility to recuperate the loan because the group depends on continuing to receive the benefits of the foundation. She will be able to help her husband, a peasant farmer, with the expenses, and also help her children, who are eight and ten years old.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also merchants. They will use the loan money to buy and sell vegetables, groceries, fresh cheeses, and women's clothing; buy ingredients for tacos, beverages, and pork tamales; and pay to transport merchandise and ingredients to the cities of Acapulgo Guerrero and Pinotepa Nacional. Maria Apolinaria R. buys green chiles and dried fish in the Pinotepa market and resells them in villages near Tlacamama. She says that she takes care of her husband, who has a leg disease that does not allow him to work. Since they do not receive support from any of their children, it is she who has supported her family for five years. She hopes that God will help her continue to make her payments and keep receiving credit from the foundation, as she has been doing for the past two and a half years. All of the group members' principal objective is to contribute economically to their families with their day-to-day earnings, and thus improve their quality of life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

He and his wife started their family at a young age and now they have three children.  Abraham has been selling chamomile and cinnamon wholesale for the past seven years.  He previously sold these products before, but he gave it up when he attracted more customers selling medicine, which he was able to acquire at low cost and generate good sales.  Within the past few weeks, his sales have gone down.  Prices have increased on everything as a result of the financial crisis the country is experiencing.  There are few jobs and workers are underpaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbraham wants to enclose his land, so he started building a wall around his property.  However, he lacks the remaining materials to finish the wall.  He needs to buy cement, sand, and gravel and also pay for labor.  A completed wall will provide better security against the crime that is plaguing the neighborhood.  His previous loans have been the only means in which Abraham has been able to make improvements to his small modest home.

By the grace of God, Aida has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually send all of them all the way through college.\r\n\r\nAida oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) and tricycle transportation business.

Aida\u2019s husband also drives one of the jeepneys.\r\n \r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy spare parts and repair the tricycle and jeepney. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nAida dreams of being able to buy another jeepney soon. She also dreams that her children will finish their education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n- Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.

At the age of 12 years old, motivated by an enterprising spirit and independence, he started to work as an assistant in a neighborhood bakery. And when the owner opened another business selling fast foods he set out to learn the business. The following year, at the age of 13, he knew how to prepare foods and slowly he began to make a business of his own once he finally was able to purchase tools for his work. Even though he still does not have a cart of his own he has a personal goal of purchasing one. He really needs one especially because the one he uses is rented. This is the reason why he has approached Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) to apply for his first Kiva loan, through which he will reach his goal. His dream is to complete his university studies in Physics; he is already on his sixth semester. His greatest challenge has been to rent a food cart that is highly functional because the one he currently rents only has one fryer and one skillet, giving him very little space to work. But despite this he works day after day to increase his profits. They never fall below 55%. And his Kiva loan will be used to purchase a food cart."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":749184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives with her partner and her three children, of 7, 4, and 2 years of age in her own home. She works a lot so that she can provide a better quality of life for her family. Her work consists of selling soup; she has a location in a very busy area of the city, and it is close to the port and also near other businesses where people go looking for the hearty and delicious soups that only she knows how to prepare. She has already been working in this business for 3 months and it is going well. She works alone but, along with her partner\u2019s business, she is able to bring in extra income. Her partner runs a motorcycle taxi business that they bought and with that they generate extra income for their budget. She likes what she does now very much, since it allows her free time in the afternoons to relax at home and spend time with her family.  In addition, she feels that it is going well since they are earning a double income in their home; she hopes down the road to have a business in her home and to start with the sale of oil. This will be the second loan she has been given from the MFP institution. For that reason she is hoping for your help, in order to continue with her goals. In addition, she has promised to stay up to date with payments and thus repay the great support that she will receive. She feels very content with the MFP group, as they are very kind and supporting of her in her endeavors. With the money requested, she plans to use it to fix the facade and interior of her business and to buy some ingredients and supplies to continue her work. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":913834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for food preparation, as well as materials for fixing the facade and interior of her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T22:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farilles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":235.69},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":237.99},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":257.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":268.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":274.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.23},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":86.58,"local_amount":225.87,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":234.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621983},{"amount":90.35,"local_amount":235.69,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":244.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836065},{"amount":91.23,"local_amount":237.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":246.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245825},{"amount":98.71,"local_amount":257.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":266.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385858},{"amount":102.85,"local_amount":268.31,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":278.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098948},{"amount":105.28,"local_amount":274.64,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":284.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713080}],"funded_date":"2011-11-21T10:37:40Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":360167,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine is a married woman with six children.

He is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but it is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walter has been farming rice with his family his entire life. On his plot of land he also has some fruits such as papaya and pineapple. As a second source of income Walter raises cattle. He needs the loan because of the bad water situation in his land. He hopes he can invest in a good watering system in order to improve his production. <\/p>\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>

In order to help her husband support the family, Ludivina set up a business selling fruit and vegetables two years ago with an initial capital of only 1,000 PHP. Now, her business has grown bigger and she is earning an average net income of 5,000 PHP a month from her sales. \r\n<p>\r\nLudivina joined Kiva partner, PMPC, in September 2007, and her membership has proved very helpful to her as she has been able to avail herself of the cooperative's products and benefits.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns and operates a business running a food stall, selling rice products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2005, Teresita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\n\nTeresita is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her 6th cycle from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with his family in a large traditional extended family in Mancourani I, the city center of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After working for several years as a driver,  he decided four years ago to return to blacksmithing, the family trade. He pays in cash and often by credit for scrap iron to make various objects (ploughs, drills, carts, axes, cooking pots, etc.) which are sold in the weekly markets of Sikasso\u2019s surrounding areas (N\u2019Tchongobougou, Kadiolo, and H\u00e9r\u00e9makono). He is much sought after and the orders from his clients keep growing. In order to satisify this ever-growing clientele, he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution.  This is his first loan request which will enable him to buy a ton of scrap iron.  With this loan, he expects to earn an average monthly profit of 150,000 CFA which will be used principally to increase his working capital, contribute to the family\u2019s expenses and pay the interest on his loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy scrap iron","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daouda ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":220818,"name":"Estela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Estela P. is from the village of Batangan, Valencia City.

Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC, which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. Fe is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be Fe's second loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has  branches  offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":770376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers such as manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Lantungan, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-05-16T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244574732}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T18:13:20Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:05:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":302779,"name":"40.thieu Hoa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ha works in agriculture farming poultry and\u00a0cattle.

Setiap hari biaya yang harus dikeluarkan Rp.20.000 hanya untuk pakan ternak saja. Dari 2 ekor penginduk yang dipelihara keuntungan yang diperoleh adalah sebesar Rp.2.000.000 setiap enam bulannya. Lewat usaha ini Ketut Derni bisa  membiayai  sekolah anaknya dan juga memperbaiki rumah tempat tinggalnya menjadi sebuah rumah yang layak ditempati. Pinjaman dari DINARI dipergunakan untuk biaya pakan ternaknya karena semakin hari harga pakan semakin meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":68900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To add growing pig, purchase female pig and pig's food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Derni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T15:41:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T04:50:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65674},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:20:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85216},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:15:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100224},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T04:04:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116787},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T02:26:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137358},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:35:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164645}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T15:41:33Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:35:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23323,"name":"Sokhem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. N.

Nematillo has raised cattle and farmed for 19 years.

For this reason Nematillo is obtaining loan from IMON International in order to obtain these animals and raise them so that in time they can be used to support his family.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her main source of income is farming.  \r\n\r\nFor more than 10 years, she has sold beer in a small bar that she runs from her house.

For that reason, she gives her all to advancing the business.\r\n\r\nThe business has become well-known in the area after growing little by little.

She is 37 years old, married and has two children who are 21 and 20 years old.  The younger child goes to school.  Argentina is attending 6th grade night school classes because she became pregnant while very young and was unable to finish school.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports a nephew who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Xai-xai by herself to move to Maputo so she could live with her sister.  Later she married and made her home in Boane.  Argentina has had her own business for more than two years.  She has no employees and has an income of about 7,900 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  She also saves some money in her bank account at Millenium Bim.\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks.  Argentina learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is her first loan, and she is asking for 10,000 meticais.  She intends to buy construction materials (adhesive cement, bricks and other items) to continue construction on her house.\r\n\r\nArgentina promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out other loans.

She is the mother of a very loving and hardworking family. She lives in her own house with 80-year-old husband Feliciano. The youngest of her sons is 25-year-old Francisco, who helps her look after their small farm. Through much hard work, Asonta has managed to work her land and make them productive. She grows bananas, corn and coffee, which she then sells wholesale in the town of Pichanaki. Through considerable effort and with the income she receives from the sale of her crops, she is able to keep her business going. She loves looking after her own crops and has been working in this way for 20 years. Carrying her products to Pichanaki is the most difficult task she faces, since the sacks are very heavy and she gets very tired. In time, she would like to buy more land, to increase the amount of crops she produces. This is her fourth loan from MFP and she has always been very punctual in making her payments. She expects to be this time also. Asonta is a very active member of her communal group and always keeps herself informed of the agreements that the group has reached. With the 1000 soles that she has requested, Asonta will buy more fertilisers and insecticides, so as to improve her crop yields. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cameron Graham, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":556118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more fertilisers and insecticides for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-17T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asonta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724786}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T22:22:03Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cameron Graham","image":693186}},{"id":212641,"name":"Minerva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Minerva M. is a 67-year-old widow who supports her family by owning and operating a general store.

The official name of this borrowing group is Aracelie B..\r\n\r\nAracelie is separated from her spouse and has eight adult children. To make a living, Aracelie owns and operates a general store.

Aracelie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Aracelie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Aracelie from ASKI.

She owns a three room brick house where she lives with her husband and five children. Four of them are daughters and one is a son. \r\n\r\nHer eldest daughter works in a factory. Her all other children stay at home. Riffat and her husband couldn\u2019t educate their children due to poor financial conditions.  \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a laborer. It is very difficult to survive as a laborer because it\u2019s not a permanent job: many times her husband doesn\u2019t get work regularly. Riffat wants her husband to start his own grocery shop so he makes a regular income. Therefore, she has applied for a loan from Asasah.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
