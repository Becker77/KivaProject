This is 42-year-old Kisa Kasanga from Mbeya. She is single with two children, ages 3 and 6. <p>\r\n\r\nKisa has been running an ice cream business since 2001. Selling ice cream is big business in Tanzania as the temperature here is HOT HOT HOT!!  There is no typical type of ice cream stand in Tanzania.  You will find people selling ice cream in little trolleys on the beach and along the streets, in deep freezers in convenience stores, and right inside people\u2019s homes.  However, they all offer a wide variety of delights from smoothie popsicles to chocolate dipped ice cream, some local and some brand names.  No matter what or where you purchase these tasty treats, they always bring a smile and a sense of relief from the constant Tanzanian sun.  <p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 6 days per week. Kisa currently earns about 134 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425 USD to purchase a deep freezer in order to keep her ice cream cool. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Kisa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":230463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

community bank.  She's 33-years old, a native of Huancayo and partnered with three children who are 9, 4 and 3 years old, respectively.  Sofia has sold clothes for three years, starting with a few things and slowly growing the business.  She buys wholesale supplies of clothes in Gamarra.

This is 39-year-old Anna Ng\u2019ondya from Mbeya. She is married with four children between the ages of 10 and 20.  Anna has been running a genge business since 2008. \r\n\r\nThe Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13 to 16 hours per day, six days per week.  Anna currently earns about US$44 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$600 in order to purchase more beans, rice and cooking oil in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the stock of goods. Anna thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":270260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beans, rice and cooking oil in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Anna A.

At the beginning, she collected only a little income because she wasn\u00b4t very well known, but with time this changed due to her charisma and the good treatment that Silvia gave her customers.  Currently, she has a number of buyers.  The income from her sales is for the education and recreation of her children.  The loan that she needs is for the investment for her recent grocery business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":410383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy consumables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuly Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erick Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Milagros ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Consuelo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roger Evaristo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Edgardo Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":306.25,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":880.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780206},{"amount":307.65,"local_amount":879,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":884.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669075},{"amount":310.1,"local_amount":886,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":891.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064533},{"amount":301,"local_amount":860,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":865.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899598}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T09:05:23Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":150080,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irma is a client of Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa.

She belongs to a poor family who needs help to change their standard of living and to be able to pursue their family dreams.\r\n\r\nWith her belief in getting out of poverty, she decided in 2007 to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with start-up capital for generating income. During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested in her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). The income is what she uses for daily expenses.\r\n\r\nNow on her fourth loan, Lylin requests 20,000 PHP to create a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase 16 sacks of rice and groceries for her store. She is very determined and disciplined to use the funds that are lent to her. \r\n\r\nDuring her almost three years in ASHI, she has shown herself to be hard-working and has strong beliefs to make her dreams come true. She would love to have her own durable and concrete house someday. Lylin C. still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family.

Noudagnon was born on January 21, 1979 in Podji in B\u00e9nin. Married to HOUNKANRIN Bernadette, a petty trader, Noudagnon is the father of one child who is attending school. Noudagnon is also raising another child. Since his birth, Noudagnon has been living in the Adonv\u00ea area in Ekp\u00e8, in the township of S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji. Noudagnon still lives with his family in this district. The couple share in supporting their family. \r\n\r\nNoudagnon left school at the secondary level and learned the trade of electrician. He has been working in this trade for about seven years. Secondarily, he sells charcoal. He buys his supplies in Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin.  In order to raise the level of his business and equip himself with electrical supplies, and thus better serve his clientele, Noudagnon is requesting, for the first time, a loan from ALID\u00e9. He hopes later on to be able to open a store selling electrical goods, which would allow him to increase his earnings. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":546518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase of electrical goods (pipes, wires, bulbs, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"SEME-PODJI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.383333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noudagnon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":41700,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":42289.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835719},{"amount":79.1,"local_amount":41633.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":42222.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576116},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-29T07:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954630},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056287},{"amount":79.48,"local_amount":41833.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42424.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347822},{"amount":78.85,"local_amount":41500.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42086.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482858},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617673},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361070},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779770},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":124999.97,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":126767.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401576}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T17:56:31Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":208172,"name":"Mrs. Mao Bo Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan has 26 people who live in Chamkar Ta Ngaet village in Kandal province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Both of them are illiterate due to financial constraints. Her husband is well known for his good customer dealings and for the quality of services he offers to his clients.  He has been operating this business for the past 6 years and Mariam is hopeful that an investment will help him further improve his business. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application.

to the Greater El Paso area. As a licensed CPR instructor with over 12 years of experience teaching, Elias is capitalizing on his experience and extensive contacts in the medical community by opening Medical Dimensions. Elias\u2019s clients are businesses and institutions in all fields that require basic medical training for their employees. Until he gets his business up and running full force, Elias has continued his full-time job as an advanced medical training instructor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to teaching CPR, Elias is developing a curriculum that teaches health care professionals how to communicate with Spanish-speaking patients. With Spanish so widely spoken in El Paso, some medical institutions are requiring their employees to attain basic proficiency in \u201cMedical Spanish.\u201d  Elias\u2019s course will teach medical terminology and basic phrases in Spanish that will facilitate better patient care.  \r\n\r\nElias officially opened Medical Dimensions on April 21st of this year. His first classes are scheduled to begin in June, when he will be teaching his Medical Spanish courses at two regional hospitals. With this loan, Elias bought a computer and printer for his business, as well as supplies for his classes. He is currently finishing his course preparations as well as procuring items such as face masks and valves that will be used by his students during training.  \r\n\r\nElias loves teaching CPR because he knows that it can be the difference between life and death. He lives by the motto coined by Albert Einstein that goes, \u201cTry not to be a person of success, but rather try to become a person of value and success will follow, because people are to be valued not for how big or small they are, but rather for their ability to perform the tasks for which they were made.\u201d\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":769173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

It is in this neighborhood where he got married and where his first child was born. Adel is the father of 11 children. The burden is becoming heavier than ever, as he needs to cover his children's expenses in terms of living, education, and other things required by the big family.\r\n\r\nAdel started his business long ago in order to cover the big expenses imposed by his big family. His business was initially a cafe shop that didn't require a large amount of capital except to purchase kilos of sugar and tea. This business achieved a good reputation in old Sana'a, where it is located, and many people became regulars. Adel's family life was somewhat improved by the limited income of that cafe, but Adel did not stop at this point. He had some thoughts about further enlarging his business by opening another shop next to the cafe for selling cabab, which is a publicly sold food eaten as breakfast.\r\n\r\nAdel was in need of a loan to start the other business and visited one of Al-Amal Bank's branches. He received three loans sequentially and this had a good impact on his business and family. Adel took the fourth loan of 180,000 YER from Al-Amal in order to pay the rent of the two shops and purchase needed materials like tea, sugar, new dishes, and tables for the cabab shop.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Adel hopes to expand his business by opening a restaurant selling all types of food, not only cabab.

Casamance is a post-conflict area, and many of its inhabitants who fled the separatist war there have only recently returned to rebuild their villages and their livelihoods.  Represented by their leader Fatou Ba, this group describes their business activities as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe village of Loudia Ouoloff is located in the department of Oussouye and it is the capital of the district.  It has more than 4,000 inhabitants who live around a village chief, in perfect harmony.  The village of Loudia Ouoloff is about 9 km from the capital of the department; its inhabitants make a living from agriculture.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the loan is to set up a rotating fund which will enable us to restart the business activities of the group.  It will allow us to invest in projects that we villagers have created ourselves.  Our group has engaged in commercial activities for a long time, with a focus on purchasing and retailing various types of merchandise.  Our group also specialized in other areas such as weaving mats, making fruit and vegetable preserves, handmade brooms, etc.  In order to restart these activities, the group requests a loan to enable us to allow fruits and vegetables to be made into preserves, and to pay palm-wine makers to provide us with the palm fronds we need to make the brooms and weave mats.\u201d  <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French : <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: le village de Loudia Ouoloff est situer dans le d\u00e9partement de Oussouye et il\r\nEst un chef  lieu d\\'arrondissement, i compte plus de 4000  habitants vivant autour d\\'un chef de village \r\nEt en parfaite harmonie.\r\nLe village de Loudia  Ouoloff est distant de 9 Km de la capitale d\u00e9partemental ; ces populations vivent de l\u2019agriculture. <p>\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : L\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral consiste \u00e0 avoir un fon de roulement afin de pouvoir relanc\u00e9 les activit\u00e9s du groupement.\r\nIl s\u2019agit entre autre de pouvoir financ\u00e9 les projets que se sont cr\u00e9er les villageois eux m\u00eame. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Le groupement m\u00e8ne depuis longtemps des activit\u00e9s commerciales dont la plus remarqu\u00e9e reste l\u2019achat et la vente de marchandise divers.\r\n En outre le groupement s\u2019est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans d\u2019autres domaines tel que le tissage des nattes, la transformation de fruits et l\u00e9gumes, la confection de balais, etc.\u2026.\r\nPour ce faire, le groupement sollicite un financement lui permettant de pouvoir achet\u00e9 les fruits et l\u00e9gume pour la transformation, pay\u00e9 les r\u00e9colteurs de vin de palme afin qu\u2019il puissent mettre \u00e0 leur disposition les rames de palmier pour la confection des balais et le tissage des natte. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

She is 55 years old, a member of TYM since 1995 in the T\u00e2n Minh village. Her success today is due to hard work and determination. She started with a loan of 20 USD which was used to raise chickens thus supplying food to her family. She also brewed rice wine. The next year, due to the successful sales of her batch of chickens, she was confident enough to take out a loan to buy 200 chickens. In 2006, she received a loan of 625 USD which was used to expand her operation, buidimg new cages for her chickens. Today, she has 250 egg laying chickens, 1300 for meat. Her revenue is 300 USD a month. Ms D\u00e2n  is very happy about her success and she hopes to be able to expand her operation again. This time she is requesting a loan of 950 USD to buy chicken feed, getting ready for the new year rush. \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\n\"N\u1ebfu ai c\u00f3 nhu c\u1ea7u v\u1ec1 tr\u1ee9ng g\u00e0, h\u00e3y \u0111\u1ebfn nh\u00e0 ch\u1ecb D\u00e2n \u1edf x\u00e3 T\u00e2n Minh.

The committee currently consists of 15 members, all residents of the neighborhood. We'll focus on Juana M., who is the director of the committee. She's married and lives in her own home with her husband. She sells clothing for women, men, and children. Juana is very hardworking and she loves her home. She runs her business out of her house from a small sitting room where she displays her merchandise for her clients. She wants to expand her business by buying more varieties of clothing because spring is around the corner and she will use the rest of the loan to finish her house. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Los verdes campos del centro poblado de Harwimayo, ubicado en la selva tropical Ayacuchana, han sido en la vida de Gloria un lugar muy agradable para trabajar. Desde muy peque\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron esta labor y ahora ella tiene sus propias tierras en las que trabaja junto a su pareja, que con mucho esmero siembran caf\u00e9, cacao y palillo. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar sus tierras, ya que as\u00ed siente que su arduo trabajo ha sido de mucho provecho. Lleva 10 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos hasta los centros de acopio situados en la ciudad de San Francisco. Gloria solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para realizar unos de sus planes, que es extender la siembra de cacao, por ser una de sus plantas que mayor  precio tiene en el mercado. Con el tiempo, espera juntar el dinero suficiente para comprar nuevas tierras. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, tiene la obligaci\u00f3n de pagar sus aportes puntualmente y esta dispuesta a hacerlo si desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito. Agradece a la instituci\u00f3n por concederle el pr\u00e9stamo.

She is a very cheerful and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her partner, 30 year-old F\u00e9lix, and her two beloved children, 9 year-old Ariel and 3 year-old Magdiel, who are the motivation behind all her efforts.  The green fields of Harwimayo, in the tropical rainforest of Ayacuchana, have been a pleasant place for Gloria to work.  Her parents taught her this work when she was very young and now she owns her own farmland where she works together with her partner.  With a lot of care, they grow coffee, cacao and palillo (a type of guava).\r\n\r\nWhat Gloria most enjoys about her work is harvesting her land since that is when she feels that her hard work has been worthwhile.  She has been in this business for ten years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her crops to the warehouses in the town of San Francisco.  Gloria is requesting this loan so that she can carry out one of her plans which is to extend her cacao plantings.  This is one of her plants which fetches the highest price in the market.  Over time, she hopes to be able to gather together enough money to buy more land.\r\n\r\nThis is Gloria's first loan from MFP.  It is her duty to make her repayments punctually and she is prepared to do this if she would like to access further loans.  She is grateful to the institution for granting her this loan.  She will use the 1,500 Peruvian soles to buy cacao seeds and, thereby, increase her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":769209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-16T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":134.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":141.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":151.72},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":158},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162.93},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":168.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":173.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.09},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.89,"local_amount":125.16,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":128.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550316},{"amount":49.4,"local_amount":134.72,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:46Z","rounded_local_amount":138.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718994},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":136.33,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":139.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350465},{"amount":51.8,"local_amount":141.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":144.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850948},{"amount":55.22,"local_amount":150.6,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":154.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666110},{"amount":54.9,"local_amount":149.73,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":153.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621223},{"amount":58.81,"local_amount":160.39,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":164.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835387},{"amount":58.46,"local_amount":159.45,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":163.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245193},{"amount":61.76,"local_amount":168.42,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":172.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385320},{"amount":63.77,"local_amount":173.93,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":178.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098422}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T22:39:30Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":302439,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or William tiene una microempresa de comercializaci\u00f3n de repuestos para abanicos, licuadoras, ollas a presi\u00f3n y art\u00edculos de segunda, tambi\u00e9n presta el servicio de reparaci\u00f3n de  electrodom\u00e9sticos menores. \u00c9l  inicio como ayudante de su cu\u00f1ado que ten\u00eda ese tipo de negocio y desde all\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 el oficio,  para luego  independizarse y tener su propio taller en un lugar poco comercial del municipio de Galapa;

This way she will take advantage of the upcoming season and celebrations such as Father\u2019s Day and Teacher\u2019s Day.  She hopes to be able to increase sales for those days.  That is why she wishes to be able to increase her inventory while giving her customers options at the same time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives in a rural community located within the district's largest geographic region in the Lambayeque province that is more than 2 hours from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n\r\nFor more than 3 years she has been making a living selling basic necessity items and groceries from a store that she set up in her house.  The business is very beneficial since it provides her with an income that supports her family.  It is beneficial for her community also, since it gives her neighbors easy access to various daily use products, whereas normally, they would have to go to the village of Olmos to buy them.   \r\n\r\nManuela wants to expand her business by buying more goods so that her customers can have a better selection of products from which to choose.  In order to meet this goal she has requested a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1000 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency).  \r\n\r\nShe is a hard-working woman and has always struggled to provide for her children.  She has had previous loans with this institution and has been punctual and responsible with her payments.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":571673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase daily use products for her store that is in her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo La Huaca -

Her store and Internet shop is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her businesses, Martina is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her store inventory, and to add a computer to her Internet shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMartina hopes to be able to expand soon, as she hopes to have her own house and lot in a prominent subdivision in a nice location.

She learned to make beautiful hand-made textiles as a girl and now she operates a business making and selling them, an important source of income for her family.  She works in the comfort of her own house, an advantage because she can look after her daughter while she works.  There are times when she has to make dozens of pieces and there's so much work that she has to hire extra help.  She always stocks up on the supplies--thread, for example, and various colors of yarn--she needs for the business.

She is blessed with four children, who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere because she wants to give them a better future. \n\nGladys herself was unable to study to get a white collar job because of the difficult situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows, and she is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cows, she is able to get between 10 and 15 liters a day, and this helps her to support her family. She also does some side hustle business(timber cutting business).\n\nGladys also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements, and this is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will also be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence increased profit levels. \n\nGladys is really visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Gladys believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her children a solid educational background. This loan will be Gladys way out of poverty.\nHelp Gladys with the loan she needs so she can succeed in everything she\u2019s been working so hard for for many years.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2047012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2518,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aunt Sarah is a medium-sized commercial farmer.

old, married with two children aged 2 and 5 and lives in Waspan Norte, in the city of Managua, Nicaragua. Her husband works as a greengrocer, selling his produce among the various districts of the city and therefore has to travel many kilometres. She has made a real effort in supporting him, now that everything is expensive and they have to provide for their children. She sells fried snacks and organises raffles, which means she has to travel around. This leaves her exhausted but by the evening, when she finishes her selling for the day, she feels satisfied. She started this business with a settlement from the previous job she had in the duty-free zone of the city. This is the first loan she requests from AFODENIC and she will use it to install a sewage system and toilet in her house, providing more hygienic living conditions for her family because at the moment, they only have a latrine that is almost full. Her plan is to also complete the building of her house, which at present is made of zinc and to improve her home, making it more secure for her family. Finally, she aims to establish a fixed place from where she can sell her fried snacks and gain more customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Roden-Scott, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":257362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy piping in order to install a sewage system and toilet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.88,"local_amount":1013.14,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1091.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351587},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":986.86,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038925},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929220},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384132},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890594},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111893}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T19:37:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:37:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Roden-Scott","image":null}},{"id":88558,"name":"Carolina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Carolina B. is a fish vendor.

She\u2019s 55 years old; she\u2019s married and a mother of 6 children between 27 and 40. All of them have already finished their general education. However, she is still responsible for two of them and also her goddaughter who lives with her. \r\n\r\nClara lost her parents when she was a child and grew up with her grandfather on her mother\u2019s side, until he died when she was on 2nd grade. For this reason, and desperate after not having any relatives who could take care of her, she moved with a neighbor. Years later, she moves with her husband and gets pregnant with her first child, but at the same time her husband is recruited for mandatory military service for three years. So, Clara\u2019s life becomes even harder. After his arrival to Namaacha, he\u2019s assigned to work at the Vila de Namaacha and he moves with family with him.\r\n\r\nOnce there, and with the help of her husband, Clara opens her own kitchen pots business, buying products in Maputo capital and reselling them in Swaziland, their neighbor country by packages, on Thursdays and Saturdays from 5am to 6pm, at the local market where she can also exchange them for other products, spending 10,000.00MT on each trip. Her profits reach the 5,000.00MT depending on the season of the year. \r\n\r\nShe came to Hluvuku and Kiva to request for a 25,000.00MT loan to upgrade her business (purchasing more pots, that is, aluminum kitchen pots) \u2013 the Swazi community, on the South side of the African continent bears a strong tradition of using these type of pots to prepare their meals. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Clara receives from Hluvuku and the first one from Kiva. Her first loan was for 20,000.00 and was used to increase the stock of her products. She is confident she will repay this money before the stipulated time, and that she will be able to request for a new loan in order to build a farmyard for chicken breeding in her new house.  <br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Burulcha raised three children.  Right now, her oldest daughter is twenty-seven years old.  She works overseas in Dubai.  The middle son is twenty-five.  He works in Kyrgyzstan and lives separately.  The youngest, twenty-one-year-old daughter lives with the older sister in Dubai.  Despite her age, Burulcha is actively involved in increasing livestock headcount, and thus can provide herself with all the necessities.   Two years ago, her daughter sent her money in the sum of six thousand som, and Burulcha was able to purchase livestock.   She liked breeding livestock so much that she fully devoted herself to this entrepreneurship.  With time, Burulcha could increase livestock headcount, having sold which, she decided to give her son a car right away.  Currently, she keeps a cow and a bull for her domestic needs and is also involved in increasing headcount of cattle.  Burulcha sees a wide spectrum of opportunities in this business because the environment in Kyrgyzstan is very conducive to breeding livestock.  This is precisely the reason why Burulcha decided to request a loan in order to purchase bulls and send them to a village, where her mother lives.  After raising livestock there for half a year, Burulcha would want to sell all of the purchased livestock and buy soft furniture for home.  Burulcha\u2019s plans also include varying her entrepreneurial activity and opening a tire vulcanization shop, where her son would work.  In the future, Burulcha also wants to build a big house for herself and her son.  For this, she is ready to sacrifice her time and effort.\r\n<p>\r\nAlong with Burulcha, this group includes Guliya, Gulnara and Myskal.\r\nGuliya is fifty-seven.  Her husband and she are retired.  Their children are grown and live separately.  Together with her husband, Guliya keep cows and have been involved in small-scale pastoral farming.  They were able to increase livestock headcount and build a house.  Guliya needs a loan in order to buy more livestock to increase headcount.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnara is a mother of five children.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Gulnara is involved in animal husbandry.  Her husband provided Gulnara with the starting capital and helped her in other ways in her new business.  Gulnara is happy with her business and requested a loan in order to purchase a cow and then sell milk.\r\n<p>\r\nMyskal is forty-five.  She is a widow and a mother of three children.  Myskal makes a living from animal husbandry.  She decided to get involved in this business on her own.  None of her children help her with the business.  Myskal decided to request a loan in order to purchase a bull, raise it and then sell it.         \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

His eldest son helps out in the shop, something that gladdens Jos\u00e9 very much, since he expects his sons to inherit the business.  Jos\u00e9  requests funding so that he can buy lumber at wholesale so that he can have more products, like wardrobes, tables, etc. to offer people, the sales of which he hopes will increase his family's income so that he can offer his children the best.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She does her business at the new market of M\u00e9dine Sikasso. \r\nWanting to better satisfy her growing number of clients, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso over four years ago. After two group loans with an association of women from her village, she is on her second individual loan. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full.\r\nWith this loan, she plans on buying 40 cases of potatoes from the wholesale distributors who sell at the fair. She does her sales at retail, in cash and credit, to a rich and varied clientele. Dj\u00e9n\u00e8be plans on making a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA which she will use to increase her commercial funds, contribute to her family's expenses, pay the interest on her loan, and invest the rest in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":475442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of Potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T23:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991350},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021625},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746415},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778951},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961163},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699330}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T01:52:32Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":174996,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ny P. is 47 years old and she lives in Chheu Teal Phluoh village in Takeo province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She\u2019s married and has four children who are 11, 8, 7 and 4 years of age.  The oldest started secondary school this year, the next two are in elementary school and the youngest started Kindergarten this year.  Her husband is a Mechanic.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank since four cycles ago and she likes it because with the loans she\u2019s been able to help her husband with his business where she now works too.\r\n\r\nThey have an auto repair shop where they do all kinds of jobs.  They also sell spare parts: tires, lubricants, oil and other parts.  They work Monday through Saturday from 7:30am until 6pm; they have two employees.  While her husband does the mechanical work she handles the bookkeeping, purchasing and spare parts sales.  She tells us that they\u2019ve been in business 9 years and, although it was difficult at first, they\u2019ve managed to secure many customers who prefer them for their work and responsibility.  She tells us that often they have jobs to do outside the city.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy oil, spare parts, filters and tires, among other products.  Her goal is to enlarge the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":773565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy lubricants, spare parts, filters, tires, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-04T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yina Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504170},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668114},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036863},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797426},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608535},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562884}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T07:56:18Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":306568,"name":"Heom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heom, 48 years old, is a humble father who has five children.

Her common-law husband, Cesar, is a farmer and they have four beautiful children, ages 22, 21, 20 and 14, who they love very much.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Quelita sells groceries out of a store set up in her house.  Here she attends to her customers, the majority of whom are neighbors.  She started the business to make extra income and has been in it now for six years.  With the help of a loan and her own savings she was able to set up the store and over time has grown and attraced many customers.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it allows her to be at home and have an income while also having free time for other activities and housework.  What she does not like so much is when customers ask for credit for their purchases since she has had several bad experiences.  So now she sells everything on a cash basis which gives her better results.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to continue growing and expanding the business.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial support so she can carry out her plans.

Every day she takes care of the piglets. The food mixtures that she gave to the pig consist of fine rice chaff, concentrate, and mineral so that the milk quality is good. After 2 months, the piglets can be sold for Rp. 250,000 (about  $27) per piglet so she can earn Rp. 2,500,000 (about $276).

Although she has recently remarried, she remembers the hardships she experienced as a single mother and wishes to secure a future for her family.\n\nAfter Amancia\u2019s first husband passed away she provided for her children by selling clothing in Puerto Plata.  Amancia says that she used to buy clothes at a discount from a warehouse in Santiago and then sell individual items of clothing in her neighborhood.   Now, she hopes to use Esperanza to help her to start selling clothes again.  Amancia believes that with the help of Esperanza she will be able to make her business a success.  She says that Esperanza\u2019s loan will allow her to obtain an additional discount from the warehouse because she will be able to buy in bulk.\n\nAmancia\u2019s hope is to spend the income from her clothing sales to provide her children with a good education.  She says that she wants to help her children to learn English and dreams that she will be able to send them all to college.  Amancia is particularly interested in helping her youngest son Rafael to pursue an artistic career.

The older child is working while the younger one is still a student.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. David has managed to buy most of the machinery for his welding business, which helps make his job easier.  This will be his ninth loan with AFODENIC.  He is thankful for the financial support that helped him acquire his machinery.  With his current loan, he plans to buy welding materials so that he can provide good service and follow-up to his customers.

She gets her supplies locally from wholesalers, and she sells generally for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of women.\r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a monthly profit of 250,000 FCFA which will be used essentially to expand her business, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan; the rest will be invested in her activity.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":512181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of sheets, curtains and tablemats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746578},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779127},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961327},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699445},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913364},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180534}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T20:18:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":191849,"name":"Mohammed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is the father of a nine-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son.\r\n\r\nMohamamd is an employee of the Palestinian National Authority but his salary barely covers basic family needs.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This school was founded in 1947 by the Ahmadiyya Mission. Currently the school is staffed with fourteen teachers and has an enrollment of 400 pupils.    \r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 8,750,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials, some a piece of land, pay school fees for their children, while some of them will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nAlice V.

is married and lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running three small businesses: aquaculture, tailoring and raising livestock. Her husband, Hernanie E., who is 60 years old, works as a laborer. They have four children who range in age from 26 to 34. Virginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because wanted a better life for her family. With the help of her 14 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been achieving this goal. Her most recent loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 and meant improvements to her family's life. She is applying for a new loan, her 15th, for PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to expand her aquaculture business and thereby help pay for her children's education and for home repairs. Virginia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She operates 2 business ventures:  abaca weaving and a general store. Her husband, Ronelo, who is 48 years old, works as a farmer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children aged between 16 and 25.\r\n\r\nAnnabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her abaca weaving business. In that way she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Annabelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Lecilda is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional bread, flour, milk, and coffee. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lecilda from HSPFI.

They live in traditional families.  Their average age is 29 and they have an average of at least 3 children.  They cultivate peanuts.  With the goal of making their agricultural business profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago.  After fully repaying their prior loans, they are on their third loan. The current loan for ADA, who is the president of the group and the first person standing on the left with the blue scarf, will be used to buy peanut seeds, small equipment, and inputs for cultivation, at the main market in SAN.  After the rainy season, the harvest is stored for a certain time so that it has value, before being sold at the main market of SAN and at other nearby markets, at retail (often at wholesale), in cash, to customers who usually come from large cities.  The members of the group expect to each make, after the distribution and sale of their agricultural products, a profit of 17000 to 70000 FCFA, which will be used to pay the interest on the loan and household expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":790744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase inputs, seeds, and small equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djalakoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Ousmane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foune","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":308600.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283067}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T02:54:06Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":310681,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a divorced woman with five children, all of whom attend school.

When Yasser gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase more stock so he will have a better selection of goods for sale which will enable him to compete and increase his income. He will also improve his store by purchasing more shelves and enhancing store lighting.Yasser is photographed in his store. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

When she was a child she used to put her parents' cows out to pasture as they had large quantities of them and since she married she has worked in agriculture as her husband works in this.  Now they grow 3 to 4 hectares of potato, she says it is profitable for them,  above all when the market becomes scarce. She recently took them to sell and once that harvest can be stored, it lasts her 3 to 4 months and meanwhile she lives from the sale of her cows and when the price of potato increases she takes it to market. Cultivating her lands makes her happy, but it becomes difficult when she has to fertilize and medicate her lands.  This is her 7th loan with MFP, during this time she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments.  With this money she will buy fertilizers with nitrate, urea and 18 so that in this way her potato crops react well. This will cost her an approximate 3500 to 4000 soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":230596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer for potato crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T03:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":164.29,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":507.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210605},{"amount":985.71,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3047.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640293}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T23:19:06Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}}]}
