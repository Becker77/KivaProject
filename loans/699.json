For the past 18 years he has been farming, planting potatos, corn and peas which he does to sell as well as for his own consumption. Every day he tends to his fields. In the case of corn, he dries it and later threshes it, puts it in sacks and stores it for future sales. The process for planting his fields is first to prepare them with organic fertilizer, later using his plough he sows them, and afterwards is the period when he irrigates and applies fertilizer and insecticides, if necessary. All this is to insure a good harvest. Over the past few years, climate changes have seriously affected his harvest and for this reason he has decided from now on to plant for his own consumption and to produce alfalfa for feediing his animals. During the next months, he will shift his work to mostly livestock farming.

Her husband works as a driver of a shuttle city taxi. Masuda sells school supplies on the market. She has been in this business for eight years.

Canjusa, Pulupandan Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, Cheryl started making Ginamos - salted and fermented krill - to sell in the local market. But she found that it was not easy if you don't have sufficient capital. So when she was invited to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, she immediately got her husband's consent to join, and that was how her life changed for the better for her and her family.\r\n\r\nNow her 4 children are all going to school, and the income from the ginamos is a big help to her family's financial stability and security. Her current operations nets PHP 7,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cheryl wants to borrow PHP 28,000.00 as additional capital so that she could increase her production capacity and improve her income potential.\r\n\r\nWhat is Ginamos\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer. \r\n\r\nCheryl is shown in the picture cutting up a block of Ginamos to sell on retail.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":361839,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has worked very hard her whole life to get ahead..  She lives in her own house and what she wants most is to have a peaceful old age.\r\nShe spends her days together with her beloved animals,feeding and caring for her cows with great tenderness so that they produce a lot of milk and she can make more cheese.  Her main sales are in the Sunday market in her village where her cheese is very much in demand and sells quickly.\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is to make the cheese in the comfort of her home.  For the last 35 years she has been working in this and what she considers the most difficult aspect is the feeding of the cows.

Chu  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.  Chu  is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Chu  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nChu  Th\u1ecb H.

She sells fish and rice. Marites has been a member in very good standing of ASHI Antique South Branch since 1999. She is also one of the trusted members of the branch who is approved to obtain a bigger loan.\r\n\r\nMarites and her husband, William S., have three children: Marwill, age 26, Willmar, age 22, and William, age 20. The youngest is still engaged in his studies. Marites's husband is employed as a government employee. While they both earn an income, Marites is concerned about challenges in her own business, specifically because there are times when she has a smaller income due to fluctuations in capital and the availability of supplies of fish. Despite these challenges, she maintains a 100% credit rating in ASHI because she wants to achieve greater working capital and, above all, she wants to prove that poor individuals such as herself have dignity and are worthy of trust.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan she is requesting Php 47,000, to be utilized as additional capital for her fish vending and rice retail business.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dreams in life are for her youngest to finish his studies and for the resources to build and reside in a decent house, through the help of ASHI and Kiva. She aspires toward becoming financially stable so that they can also help their neighbors and relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

I had few opportunities to attend school due to the 16-year civil war that affected the country; however, I did attend school up until the 4th grade. With schools paralyzed because of the war, I was obligated to immigrate to South Africa in search of work. There I worked at a woodcutting company for four years. After obtaining my driver\u2019s license I began transporting cargo and passengers from Mozambique to South Africa. With the experience I gained I decided to open my own business; I turned to Hluvuku, the only microfinance institution in the area. The vehicle I acquired was a great fit for my work, but months later I was involved in an accident. Since, the vehicle has required restoration. \r\n<p>Armando is a self-employed driver who transports passengers and goods from Mozambique to South Africa and vice-versa. At this time he employs 2 people. With this loan he intends to repair his vehicle and continue with his work\u2014being that this business helps three families survive, including Armando\u2019s.

She also owns a gift shop in the same trading centre. She has struggled to pay the rent for her businesses.

He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals, cleaning them, feeding them and pasturing them.\r\n\r\nNow, Mahmad wants to expand his business and buy more cattle. To do that, he applied for a loan of 825 USD. He thanks all lenders for their support. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since she was very young she started working as an agriculturist. She learned the techniques used by her parents and when she married she continued working the fields, cultivating potatoes, fingerling potatoes, corn, and sweet peas. All her efforts to support her family. Nine years have passed and since then she has continued to enjoy working the fields because it is what she knows to do best, although it is difficult to get up at the break of dawn every day and be so vigilant in the care of the plantations. It is very gratifying to harvest and sell the products to wholesalers in the region, giving her payments on a regular basis. This permits her to provide a good quality of life to her children.  Along with this business she is also a cattle farmer and she makes her sales whenever producers come to the region. As she is an enterprising person she has plans for the future to have larger plantations to increase production and her earnings.

other eclectic items.  Located with other art and collectible stores in an antique mall, Christine considers The Vintage Kitty a \u201cconscious boutique\u201d both because of the unique artwork she carries and because she uses her store as a venue to raise awareness for animal rescue.\r\n\r\nChristine offers consignment for people who don\u2019t have a venue to sell their work. Consignment means that she sells their item at her store without actually buying it from them.  They are compensated if the item sells, but if it does not sell, she is not left with inventory she cannot move.  She says consignment has helped keep her costs and inventory low.  She advertises through Facebook and Craigslist, in addition to her own webpage and blog.  If necessary, she will even go door-to-door to ask people if they have things they want to sell.\r\n\r\nAs Christine continues to grow and develop The Vintage Kitty, she looks to further hone its image by carrying more selective work.  Christine says that she is not necessarily interested in carrying \u201cexclusive artwork,\u201d but instead focuses on carrying smart, unique pieces that show creativity.  She does not plan to limit her business contacts to professional artists, but also is interested in talented, amateur artists that create for fun.  \r\n\r\nChristine heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana through theredshoes.org, an organization that empowers women through personal and spiritual development.  Christine is using this loan to improve the store\u2019s appearance through new displays, and to grow her inventory.    \r\n\r\nChristine strongly believes that with will-power, you can achieve anything.  She was the first person in her family to graduate from high school, and the first to attend and graduate from college.  Christine actively works with the local Baton Rouge animal rescue.  She keeps her store stocked with animal rescue literature, and uses her home as a foster home for rescue cats.\r\n\r\nHer long-term goal is to move The Vintage Kitty to its own location.  Having a stand-alone store would provide her the freedom to better create the image she wants for her business, as well as let her use her store as a center for rescue cats.  The rescue cat center would be separate from her business, and would be maintained and supported by the local animal rescue center.\r\n\r\nCheck out The Vintage Kitty at http:\/\/thevintagekitty.com\/index.htm.  On her website, she also has links to her blog and a link to The Vintage Kitty\u2019s Facebook page.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6925,"image":{"id":715117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations

Surgi\u00f3 a fines del siglo XIX como un sector tradicional de la ciudad. Su eje principal es la Av. Independencia, por la cual pasaba el antiguo Camino del Inca, puerta de entrada por el norte, a la ciudad de Santiago. Dada su amplia poblaci\u00f3n ind\u00edgena, en Independencia se encuentra el Centro Cultural Ind\u00edgena de Chile. Cuenta tambi\u00e9n con importantes construcciones hist\u00f3ricas, entre ellas 6 monumentos hist\u00f3ricos de Chile.\n","en":"This Communal Bank is called \u201cCreando Futuro\u201d (Creating the Future) and consists of 18 entrepreneurs.  They are from the community of Independencia in the city of Santiago.  All of them engage in businesses such as trade, selling fast food, selling used clothing, selling wool, selling baby clothes, selling school supplies, selling fruit, and offering sewing services.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn the photograph, Ximena is one of the women standing on the right side.  She has short brown hair, but only her face is visible in the photo. Ximena prepares and sells sopapillas, empanadas, rolls, tea, and coffee.  She has been in this business for two years.  Ximena sells at an open market on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  On the weekends, she has a business set up at a \u201cpersa\u201d (a large fair).  \r\n<p>\r\nDuring the spring and summer seasons, Ximena makes and sells tropical juices.  To do this, she buys fruit twice a week so that she can stock her inventory.  In the winter, Ximena buys her merchandise at stores because the cost of supplies is more affordable.  With this loan, she will buy a larger cart.  She needs to renovate the infrastructure of her business, and this cart will give her more space.  Ximena is making this investment with her husband because he plans to use it to move his merchandise.  He works at the open market selling other types of products.  This new cart will allow her to obtain a permit so that she can sell her products without difficulty.  \r\n<p>\r\nXimena lives with her husband and two daughters.  One of her daughters helps her on the weekends with generating sales for her business.  She dreams of improving her family\u2019s socioeconomic status and providing her daughters with an education.  \r\n<p>\r\nXimena has a perfect attendance record at the training seminars.  The last course she took was in hairstyling and now she is enrolled in a computer course.  Her motivation to learn and expand her knowledge will help her have a more stable business in the future.  She is very pleased and grateful for the support that Fondo Esperanza has provided through the training classes and the loans.  \r\n<p>\r\nIndependencia is one of 34 communities that make up the city of Santiago, the Chilean capital.  It is located in the north-central section.  Independencia emerged in the late nineteenth century as a traditional section of the city.  The main thoroughfare is Independencia Avenue, which intersects with the old Inca Trail, the gateway to the north and to the city of Santiago.  Given the growing indigenous population, Independencia became the Indigenous Cultural Center of Chile.  It also has major historical buildings, including six Chilean historical monuments.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":792048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a large vending cart.

He has a very limited education, but he is a very hard worker. Although he is over 65 years old, he does not intend to stop working the lands that have provided for him and his family for decades. He feels fortunate to have the opportunity to attain some financing for his lands. He plans to invest in seeds and some pesticides. The loan will help him avoid borrowing from informal lenders who charge way too much and take a large part of the profits he makes from his crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Rimigio is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

This is 45-year-old Elizabeth from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has two children, ages 14 and 19. She also supports another dependant because his parents cannot take care of him. Elizabeth runs a genge or a grocery business. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, where general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish are sold. It is the kind of place that local people send their children to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don't have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. Elizabeth's business is doing good. She works at the business 13 hours day, 7 days week, and she has two employees to assist her. Elizabeth currently earns about $350 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $425 USD so she can purchase additional stock. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":212163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock for her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T00:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T01:39:43Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348050},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970633},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886850},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436110},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130383}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T01:39:43Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":73018,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edwin tiene 26 a\u00f1os, convive con su pareja y sus dos hijos que ya est\u00e1n estudiando.

Unfortunately, her husband has been in prison since 2007. She has been working as a taxi driver since 2004 in Baganuur, a province of Mongolia. The town where she lives is a very small and most of the residents know each other. This works to her advantage as her clients find her to be very flexible about payment, and she has built up a good reputation this way. For instance, if someone has no money for cab, she says that \"You can pay tomorrow.\" She also doesn't smoke; therefore, her cab is cleaner than other cabs. One year ago she sold her old car which was made in Korea and bought a second-hand but better Nissan \"Sunny\" Japanese car.

Anos depois o seu marido perde a vida por motivo de do\u00ean\u00e7a e a vida fica dificil, ent\u00e3o ela consegue aranjar um emprego na cidade capital Maputo como empregada dom\u00e9stica e trabalha durante 2 anos onde recebia 2.300.00mt. \nMas teve que abandonar pois vivia longe dos seus filhos e regressa novamente a Namaacha onde inicia seu pr\u00f3prio neg\u00f3cio de venda de p\u00e3es e rebu\u00e7ados no quintal da sua casa. \n\nNa tentativa de aumentar o volume do seu neg\u00f3cio aproxima se a Hluvuku solicitando um empr\u00e9stimo para refor\u00e7ar a actividade da cria\u00e7ao de pintos que j\u00e1 iniciara com os lucrus obtidos no emprestimo passado.Tem criado uma m\u00e9dia de 2 caixas em sua casa gastando 15.000.00mt em cada fase tendo de lucro 6.000.00mt que aplica nas dispesas da casa e ainda consegue poupar cerca de 1.000.00mt por m\u00eas.\n\nEste \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo de Alice na Hluvuku e Kiva no valor de 12.000.00mt com o qual pretende usar para aumentar a quantidade da sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o, o anterior empr\u00e9stimo foi no valor de 10.000.00mt e foi usado para dar in\u00edcio de venda de rebu\u00e7ados. \nEsta confiante que vai pagar sem nenhum problema pois ela conta tamb\u00e9m com receita de aluguer da sua casa cituada em Boane. Futuramente pretende pedir um novo empr\u00e9stimo para construir o seu pr\u00f3prio estabelecimento de venda e deixar de vender somente no quintal da sua casa.\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Alice T. was born in the district of Namaacha, close to the border with Swaziland.  She is a widow and has 4 children who range in age from 9 to 26 years old. The three youngest children are in school. She lives in her own home and is not financially responsible for anyone except her children.\r\n \r\nAfter finishing her primary education, Alice was transferred to the district seat of Namaacha, which is 25 kilometers from the town of Goba where she was born. She continued with her studies and finished 7th grade. Then she got pregnant and went to live with her husband, who was an important businessman. This is why she left school. Years later, her husband died after an illness and life became difficult. It was then that she managed to get a job in the capital, Maputo, as a household servant. She held this job for 2 years, receiving a salary of 2300 meticais per month. \r\n\r\nShe had to leave this job because she was living far from her children, and so she returned to Namaacha. There she began her own business selling bread and candy from the yard of her house.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to increase the scope of her business, she has approached Hluvuku to ask for a loan to help her to raise baby chicks. She had already started with this enterprise using the profit she made after getting her previous loan. She has raised on average 2 cartons full during each cycle, costing 15,000 meticais and making a profit of 6000 meticais. She uses this income to cover household expenses and also saves some 1000 meticais each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Alice\u2019s 2nd loan with Hluvuku and Kiva, for the amount of 12000 Meticales. She plans to use the loan to increase the number of chicks she raises. Her previous loan, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, was used to start her sales of candy.\r\n\r\nAlice is confident that she will have no problems repaying this loan because she also has income from the rental of a house she owns in Boane. In the future she would like to get another loan to build her own store, so that she no longer has to sell from her own yard. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending (native delicacies) and ready to wear clothes\/pants. Her husband Ereneo, who is 47 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 11 and 19 years old. Eustequia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eustequia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy ingredients for her native delicacies so that she can continue to save up for future education and improvement of business. Eustequia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have been together for 16 years and have two children.  They live in their own home in the District of Pichari.  When Nicanor started farming, he decided to grow and sell coffee.  At first, he did not generate the level of income that he had hoped but he decided to continue nonetheless.  Today he grows a good amount of coffee that he is able to distribute to his customers in a timely and efficient manner.  He is very pleased that he was able to persevere because his sales have gradually increased when compared to other seasons.  Nicanor and his wife usually work together, but he must hire workers during the planting and harvesting seasons because the additional effort is needed to complete tasks.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP.  Nicanor hopes to receive everyone\u2019s support so that he can develop his business.  This loan of 2000 PEN will be used to buy a new plot of farmland.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":800543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a plot of farmland.

She wants to expand in the marketplace and go to other localities where she can sell her product, thereby attracting new customers and increasing her earnings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":838781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cashew nuts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2011-08-09T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":365,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":34.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":39.88},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":42.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.4},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.95,"local_amount":31.1,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":31.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227106083},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":32.41,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232867242},{"amount":33.71,"local_amount":32.81,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":33.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238683233},{"amount":35.64,"local_amount":34.69,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":35.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244638759},{"amount":36.48,"local_amount":35.51,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":36.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250855256},{"amount":40.12,"local_amount":39.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257265033},{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":36.16,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":37.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263406286},{"amount":126.65,"local_amount":123.27,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":126.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270120805}],"funded_date":"2011-08-18T02:30:45Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:50:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":327907,"name":"Tehmina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tehmina is a working lady and supports her husband financially by doing clothes stitching for her neighboring clients.

She is married to Felicito, a porter, and she is a mother to their three children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nVilma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVilma hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

The loan brought Muazzamhon a nice profit, so she decided to do it again. Muazzamhon, 39 is married and has 4 children\u20142 boys and 2 girls. Her husband works on \u201cnonvoykhone\u201d (a bakery that produces Tajik traditional bread\u2014<i>lavash<\/i>). The money that Muazzamhon\u2019s husband makes is enough only to buy food and nothing else. A few years ago, Muazzamhon started her business. Gradually expanding, she rented a trading spot in a store. Now, Muazzamhon sells clothing for children and shoes for all ages.

Since her childhood she grew bananas and hot peppers, but when she formed a family, she became a trader of hot peppers and cayhuas (local peppers), which resulted in a highly profitable undertaking. She ships her products to the capital city of her region and to Lima, and within three days her customers transfer the money through the banking system. Marta likes to take care of her crops and her business, because her income from it allows her to offer a good education to her children.

After successfully graduating from one of the prestigious universities of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyz National University, she worked as an accountant for more years than she could have imagined that she would. She was suddenly let go in 2004. The way she displayed courage was something unimaginable. Because an ambitious mind wants success, she was able to confront that situation. Thanks to God, she had studied well, because she started a little business which soon turned into big one. \r\n\r\nFor 8,000 KGS ($178) she bought a cow. Selling milk didn't contribute enough to the family's budget, so they borrowed money from relatives to buy livestock. They bought bull calves, so that after fattening them they could sell them. Her revenue was about 500 KGS ($12). In the meantime, life went on and now she is fifty-four years old. She has married and has a brilliant husband who works as a teacher. In his free time he helps her with her business. Also she has two children; a daughter and a son. Her daughter is already married and now lives separately, and her son is a student. She is planning to increase the number of calves and provide education for her son as well. She wants a loan to buy bull calves for reselling after fattening. \r\n\r\nGulzada K. is thirty-eight years old and is married. Her husband takes across passengers. They have six children, the elder one studying in the university, the rest attending local schools.  Ten years ago she successfully opened up a business by selling their bull calf for 20,000 KGS ($445). She sells housewares. Her revenue per month is about 15,000 KGS ($334). They already have bought a house, and have built a shop and a shed. She wants a loan to buy more housewares to sell.\r\n\r\nOrozkul H. is a married woman. She is twenty-six years old and has two children who are at home with her. Her husband works on projects sometimes and also resells sheep in the farmyard. Three years ago they started their business with 5,000 KGS ($112) and now their profit per month is about 3,000 KGS ($65).

The official name of this borrowing group is 08.1.1 Nam Ng\u1ea1n.\r\n\r\nHanh is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Hanh owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.

Hanh has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Hanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

Desde muy peque\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron esta labor y ahora ella tiene sus propias tierras en las que trabaja junto a su pareja, que con mucho esmero siembran flores como por ejemplo rosas, crisantemos, claveles y otras flores. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar sus tierras, ya que as\u00ed siente que su arduo trabajo ha sido de mucho provecho. Lleva varios a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos hasta los centros de acopio situados en las ciudades de Urubamba y Cusco. Martha solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para realizar unos de sus planes, que es extender la siembra de flores, por ser una de sus plantas que mayor precio tiene en el mercado. Con el tiempo, espera juntar el dinero suficiente para abrir una maderera. Ella tiene la obligaci\u00f3n de pagar sus aportes puntualmente y est\u00e1 dispuesta a hacerlo si desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito. Agradece a la instituci\u00f3n por concederle el pr\u00e9stamo. Con los 1,200 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 semillas y as\u00ed aumentar su producci\u00f3n.","en":"Martha was born in Quillabamba (Cusco, Peru). She is 40 years old and she is a very happy and hardworking woman. She lives in a house which she owns together with her partner Isaac and their only son. He is the motivation for all of their efforts. The green fields of the community of Chichubamba, located in Valle Sagrado de los Incas, is where Martha currently lives and in life it has been a most pleasant place for her to work. \r\n\r\nWhen she was very young her parents taught her this business and today she has her own fields where she works together with her partner. With a great deal of care they cultivate flowers, such as roses, chrysanthemums, carnations, and other flowers. what she most enjoys about her work is to harvest the fields because this is when she feels that her arduous work has been a great investment. She has been in the business for several years and she considers the most difficult part to be the transportation of the harvest to the collection centers in the cities of Urubamba and Cusco. Martha requests a loan to carry out one of her plans, which is to extend her flower plantation because her plants obtain the best price in the market. With time she hopes to save enough money to start a lumber yard. She has the obligation to make her payments on time and she is ready to do so if she wants to have another loan. She is thankful to the organization for granting her this loan. With the 1200 nuevos soles she will purchase seeds to increase production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":771223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds to increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-05-19T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":181.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":188.48},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":195.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":203.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":211.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.98,"local_amount":181.28,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":187.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216455820},{"amount":70.68,"local_amount":188.48,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":194.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221619467},{"amount":73.48,"local_amount":195.95,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":202.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226988256},{"amount":76.4,"local_amount":203.72,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":210.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232746956},{"amount":79.43,"local_amount":211.81,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":218.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238551164},{"amount":82.03,"local_amount":218.76,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":226.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244510118}],"funded_date":"2011-05-19T20:43:13Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303331,"name":"Zephaniah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zephaniah is 30 years old, married, and the father of two.

Some roll the threads into a ball, others separate and others dye until they go to high school or the university.  With the loans she has received, she has been able to expand the business.  Before she had capital, she could only weave from 5 to 10 <em>mantas<\/em>.  Now she weaves 30 to 40 <em>mantas<\/em> and brings them to the large markets.  At the <em>Bancomunal<\/em>, Maximiliana has received workshops that have helped her greatly.  She serves on the executive board as the finance officer.  She considers herself to be very punctual and has learned how to save money.  Maximiliana needs a loan to buy an additional loom.  Her dream is to own a big business with 30 looms.  She is saving to buy a mending machine.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel A. is married with 5 children between the ages of 4 and 14.  Isabel began her business selling sweets in the school. Thanks to an inicial loan she received from FINCA, she opened a cafeteria in the school where the teachers and nurses take their meals.  Isabel learned to cook and believes this opened her up to a big opportunity.\r\nShe has had difficulties in her life.  She was operated on for an ovarian cyst and spent time in recovery.  Her husband helped her, but it wasn't the same and the clientele decreased.  Isabel is president of the mothers' club in her community.  She thanks FINCA because she has learned many things such as how to direct people, do business with them and see the necessities of her group.  Isabel tells us that she has changed as a person.  She is going to invest her loan by purchasing dried vegetables and bringing them to Lima, the capital.  Her dream is that her children receive a higher education.  She is going to save so that her five children can study.\r\n<p>\r\nTeresa C. is married and has 7 children.  She began her business selling cheese from a pail in the streets. \r\nThanks to the arrival of FINCA Peru to her town, she was able to receive a loan and buy more cheese.  Other groups asked for many things and certifications while all she had was her small adobe house and some cattle.  She has faced difficulties in her life, such as the death of her 27-year-old son.  Her grandchildren were left alone and she has to work hard to take care of them.  Teresa received workshops on how to save money.  Before she was very quiet, now she knows how to express herself.  Her dream is to buy a car.  With the credit she received from FINCA she will buy more cheese and also eggs to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Priya Bapat, Kiva

He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has a daughter of 17 whom he needs to support and properly educate. Muhammadjon has improved his financial situation because he has been able to wisely use the loans he has received from IMON International to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivates (as dairy products) in the surroundings of his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. want to invest her profits and this loan in medicines to sell.\r\nThe loan will help her community because drugs will be accessible to the sick and the health of the community will improve. Also, money circulation will increase in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she does not have many competitors and her capital has increased.\r\n\r\nA. will use the profit to increase her capital, pay fees for the children, and buy food for her home.\r\nShe prefers GHAPE loans because they are simple to pay off, and she appreciates the management techniques that GHAPE teaches their clients.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

It's characterized as a rural, sparsely populated zone that belongs to Lambayeque province, located an hour from Chiclayo city.\r\n\r\nRosa buys, raises and sells small livestock. She has done this for the past 6 years. After raising the animals she sells them in the Lambayeque market and sometims to visiting dealers. She usually raises sheep and poultry. This work is her most stable source of income, since her husband is a seasonal farm worker.  \r\n\r\nShe will keep working to help her husband and to provide her family with the opportunity to improve itself. It is for her family's sake that she hopes to expand her business by purchasing more animals and enriched feed, thus increasing sales. To reach her goal, Rosa has applied for a 1,500 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nRosa has previously worked with Kiva and she is very grateful to the people who helped her grow as an entrepreneur. Rosa continues to work hard towards her biggest dream: to provide her children with the opportunity to advance in the future.

SaL. started a business renting laundry machines. In 2007 she sought to strengthen her business with a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, as she was unable to meet customer demand with the two washing machines her husband had bought for that purpose.\r\n\r\nShe began her business to satisfy the needs of housewives regarding the reduction in effort and time savings of this tiring daily chore, particularly given the unrelenting sun of the Caribbean Coast where Elsy lives.\r\n\r\nShe has a tricycle she uses to transport her machines, a task in which she is assisted by her eldest daughter. With the income generated by this activity Elsy has been pursuing studies as a nursing assistant, perfected through graduate studies and updates, such as neonatal care and many other subjects.\r\n\r\nHer family consists of her husband, employed by a company, and their two daughters aged 15 and 10 years who are still in school. She dreams of seeing them become successful in their future careers.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan granted by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organisation that provided strong support, as it bolstered her working capital which contributed to Elsy\u2019s personal development as the business grew.\r\n\r\nUsing her Kiva loan she will buy two more washing machines to replace the ones bought previously, which have deteriorated to the point where they can no longer withstand the daily grind. \r\n\r\nAt 33 years of age, Elsy and her family are progressing in the same direction. While she and her husband work, their daughters study and help with the business and household tasks, so that one day they can have more opportunities for a successful life.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the limited working capital she depends on and that is needed for her business to continue moving forward.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":625265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy two more washing machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-01T07:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69737},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75344},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76600},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77876},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79174},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80494},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81835},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83199},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84586},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91155}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":69737,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":71255.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550804},{"amount":42.38,"local_amount":75344,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76985.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688416},{"amount":43.09,"local_amount":76600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":78268.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427633},{"amount":43.81,"local_amount":77876,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":79572.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001052},{"amount":44.54,"local_amount":79174,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":80898.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289063},{"amount":45.28,"local_amount":80494,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":82247.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157214},{"amount":46.03,"local_amount":81835,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83617.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230219},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":83199,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":85011.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509091},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":84586,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":86428.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673319},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":91155,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":93140.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319881}],"funded_date":"2010-11-01T13:30:32Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":245978,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther G., age 35, sells a variety of different items in her general store.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since her  chicken-breeding business is doing well, she wants to expand it by purchasing more chickens and chicken feed to earn more income to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Mak Thy, is a construction worker. Mrs. Vanny S. is 38 years old and the mother of five children, two of whom stay at home to do housework and help the parents work while the others are enrolled in the local school.\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.
