We take this opportunity to know a few of the members a little bit better.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda is 50 years old and has been selling beauty products for more than eight years.  A friend convinced her to work after she separated from her husband when her children were 15 and 12 years of age.  At the time, Yolanda was working as an assistant at a state school.  She offers her products with great enthusiasm to acquaintances, friends, teachers, and parents at the school.  Over time she decided to sign up to proviD. cosmetics from various lines (Esika, Avon, and Natura) and become a beauty consultant.  Her business is profitable because the only capital required is the money needed to purchase merchandise for her inventory.  Yolanda\u2019s hard work and desire to succeed have enabled her to fulfill her duty as a mother to proviD. food, clothing, and an education for her son who is studying electrical engineering.  Her ex-husband no longer provides financial support.  Her business went through some ups and downs as a result of paying for medical expenses and treatment when her son became ill.  He recovered quickly and afterwards she was able to buy a small refrigerator for her home.  She is requesting a loan to purchase cosmetics.  She hopes to have a house of her own sometime later because she has been a caretaker at a children\u2019s home for the past nine years.  \r\n<p>\r\nAng\u00e9lica is 39 years old.  She began working nine years ago by selling candy out of a cart that she parked outsiD. of the state schools.  On the weekends, she carried a basket of candy to sell at parks, stadiums, and patron saint festivals in the district of Chosica.  She normally sells in the afternoons and evenings because she spends her mornings performing her household chores.  The loans she has received have been used to purchase merchandise (peanuts, beans, popcorn, soft drinks, cookies, snacks, and candy).  In addition she crochets and knits items such as baby outfits, jackets, sweaters, caps, and ponchos. Ang\u00e9lica also does appliqu\u00e9s with beads, tassels, shells, strips of wood, or whatever material is in fashion and requested by her customers.  She currently has outstanding orders for dresses and jackets, so she needs a loan to purchase crochet needles and colored wool.  Her earnings will enable to help her husband with paying for food, clothing, and education for their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":461636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fiorella De Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evila Teodocia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2487.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":862.67,"local_amount":2488,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2493.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064632},{"amount":862.33,"local_amount":2487,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899691},{"amount":862.67,"local_amount":2488,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2493.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933774},{"amount":862.33,"local_amount":2487,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661367}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:21:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":170375,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet M. is a 31-year-old married woman who lives in the village Brgy Taliban, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.

M., 37, lives in San Juan de Nepomuceno, Bol\u00edvar department.  She has two children who are 13 and 17 years old.  The idea for her business came when she was having a hard time finding employment.  She took a course on disinfectant making at SENA (National Employment Service) but she didn\u2019t do too well.  She then started a beautician course and since then has done quite well providing in home manicures and hair dying services; she has a lot of regular customers thanks to the convenience of going to their homes to provide the service.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo; she\u2019s asking for $2.000.000 to buy work tools, like a hair straightening iron, a hair dryer, nail polish for manicures and to sell to her customers.  She will also buy clothing for women and children, bedspreads and towels because she also sells assorted merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe used her first loan to buy nail polish and hair cutting tools because she didn\u2019t have any.  She also invested in a women\u2019s clothing line and this is how her business has been expanding.\r\n\r\nHer family supports itself with profits from her business and with her husband\u2019s earnings as a construction worker.\r\n\r\nHer children are in school because it is precisely one of her goals to help them finish school.  Another of her dreams is to own her own home because they are sharing with their in-laws; she would also like to take a professional beautician course in the future.\r\n\r\nHer business is located on San Juan Nepomuceno\u2019s main street in a neighborhood where she is well known and where her neighbors are known teachers and public sector employees.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

To making a living, Y. owns and operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector operating a furniture-making business. The main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  Y. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000,000 VND per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Y. joined Kiva partner, SEDA, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Y. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,392,000 VND from SEDA. This loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offering. Y. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. The loan will be her third from SEDA.  Y. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SEDA<\/b><br>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Kyrgyzstan).  She is 49 years, a widow and has four children.  Sanabar was born in a simple family.  Being the oldest child in the family of ten children, she spent the majority of her time taking care of the household, such as looking after her younger brothers and sisters, doing household and caring for a small farm.  During her childhood, Sanabar dreamed of becoming a teacher, but her life forced her to pick a different destiny.  She finished school in 1980, and, according to an old tradition, her parents married her off to the Alay district in 1981.  The young family had their first child in 1983.  According to the sharia law, newlyweds remained living in the parents' home because Sanabar's husband was the youngest son.  Sanabar's husband diligently worked at a collective farm, and Sanabar took care of the domestic animals.  By that time, they already had two young children.  The collective farm allotted them very little land because at that time, one family got only 200 square meters.  It was impossible to grow anything on such a small plot of land, and the family's expenses exceeded the profits.  Years passed, and the family grew to six people.  Sanabar's husband was a leading farmer in his native village, but disaster fell on the family in 2002, when Sanabar's husband was killed by unknown men.  Five years later, Sanabar and her children decided to move to the Chui valley.  The family bought a house in 2007 in the Poltavka village and started a livestock breeding business with the purchase of one horse.  Four years passed since then, and the family experienced many challenges during this time, but thanks to Sanabar's persistence and hard work, her business became successful.  Now the household has two horses and four sheep.  In addition, the family grows beats and sell kumyz (horse milk).  Sanabar is requesting a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of two horses for fattening up.  Sanabar plans to use the loan for continued development and growth of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":798318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase horses and grow her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Poltavka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-23T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanabar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1112.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50361.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370687},{"amount":1112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50361.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862734}],"funded_date":"2011-06-24T09:30:32Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":314352,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antonia es natural de Hualahoyo, siempre ha vivido all\u00ed y en la actualidad vive con sus 3 hijos y su anciana madre en la casa que hered\u00f3.

She has always lived there and she lives with her 3 children and her elderly mother in a house which she inherited. Since she was a girl she grew up in an agricultural and farming family. She learned all that she needs to cultivate her fields where she plants corn, potatoes, peas, fava beans, and other products. She raises her livestock in a stable. Following the separation from her husband, this has been her way of life and it has given her all the income that she needs. She lives from the sales of the milk produced by her dairy cows and from the sale of potatoes and corn in the city's local market. Her children help her in the agricultural work and it is thanks to this team effort that she is awarded with her income. Today her plans are to increase the quantity of livestock and to acquire a good breed of cattle to produce more milk per day.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with decent salary. Sahar has a project of raising poultry and benefits from selling its products. She wants to expand her project and purchase more poultry and more fodder to feed them, but the amount of money she has is not enough to pay for this. This is why she has requested a loan from FATEN. When Sahar gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to expand her project and purchase more poultry and fodder. This will increase her sales and increase her income, which will offer better life conditions for her and her family. Sahar is a conservative woman, so her husband Tha'er appears in the photograph instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

B., currently I am in the business of selling typical clothing in the village of Cruz Blanca of San Juan Sacatepequez where I live.  It has been approximately four years since I came into the business of selling clothing.  At first I helped a woman sell her merchandise on commission.  At that time I worked at a vegetable packing plant and, since I had already acquired experience selling clothing, I started to invest part of my salary in selling sweaters.  Thereafter, I got married and had a daughter so I dedicated myself completely to the business which is why I saw the need to invest more capital in the business.  I now also sell local clothing such as guipiles, shirts, shawls, girdles and other products which my clients might request such as sandals.  Since I now have a fixed clientele, I deliver the clothing to my customers' homes or they stop by my home to make their purchases.  What I want to accomplish is to be able to invest more capital and to put a stall in San Juan Sacatepequz.  However, this requires a lot of capital which is why I want to increase my clientele to obtain this capital.  This will allow me to take advantage of the important upcoming holidays. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Translated from Spanish by Cindy M., Kiva Volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy Carmen Beatriz C. B., actualmente mi negocio es vender ropa t\u00edpica en la aldea Cruz Blanca de San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez, es donde yo vivo. \r\nHace aproximadamente  cuatro a\u00f1os que inicie en el negocio de la venta de ropa, pero primero yo \u00fanicamente le ayudaba a una se\u00f1ora a vender su mercader\u00eda y ella me pagaba una comisi\u00f3n, en ese entonces yo tenia un trabajo en una empacadora de verduras y con el salario que tenia, como yo ya hab\u00eda adquirido experiencia en la venta de ropa empec\u00e9 a invertir parte de mi salario para vender su\u00e9teres, pero despu\u00e9s que me case y que tengo ya una nena, me dediqu\u00e9 totalmente al negocio, por eso vi la necesidad de invertir m\u00e1s capital ya que, ahora vendo cortes t\u00edpicos, g\u00fcipiles, blusas, rebozos, fajas, y alguna otra cosa que mis clientas me van solicitando, como sandalias.  Como ya cuento con clientes fijos, la ropa la entrego en las casas de ellas o ellas llegan  a mi casa para comprar, pero lo que quiero lograr es poder invertir m\u00e1s capital y poder poner un local en San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez, pero eso requiere de mucho capital, por lo que quiero primero ganar m\u00e1s clientes obtener ese capital que necesito y aprovechar las fechas importantes m\u00e1s pr\u00f3ximas para vender y que en un plazo no muy largo pueda poner mi local."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":155727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She loves selling goods, the business through which she makes a living. \r\n\r\nFor more than five years, Emelia has been selling fruits such as bananas and oranges by the side of the road in Koforidua. She treks to surrounding villages to purchase bananas and oranges from farmers.  Emelia buys unripe bananas in bulk and covers them with plantain leaves in the bush. When they are ripe, she picks them up to sell to her customers. For lack of adequate working capital, she is not able to buy enough stock to make enough profit to support her family.

The dried fish, part of which is set aside to be sold during the shortages and winter months to earn greater revenues, is sold primarily in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango, Boussin and in the weekly fairs at Segou.

She was married for many years and blessed with three children, who are married and no longer living at home. To earn a living, Lach N. owns a hand-cart that she uses to hawk, selling cakes and boiled corn to the people around her district.  She is usually able to generate about $5 of income a day.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 46, married, and has three children. Molmol graduated from medical college as a nurse and devoted 15 years of practical experience to helping her patients to overcome their diseases. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, when Molmol was expecting a baby, her husband lost his job. Those times became a period of living in the pinch of poverty for her family. But Molmol didn\u2019t give up and decided to start her own business reselling linens, fabrics and tablecloths, using her initial capital of 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn spite of many the highs and lows in her activity, Molmol managed to broaden her business by purchasing two small shops and achieved success. These activities led her to obtain loans from \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d, which were repaid without any delays. Molmol\u2019s husband, who was infected by her enthusiasm, became the main helper and strong supporter in the business. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by deposed the political regime broke out in Osh, Molmol lost her business. Her shops were robbed and looted. However, Molmol  is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this reason, Molmol is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase home products for resale at the local market.

Her husband\u2019s support of this business is Lorena\u2019s inspiration to persevere through the test of poverty to grow her business despite her circumstances. Sari-sari stores basically sell small quantities of various foodstuffs, groceries and beverages. \u201cSari\u201d is a native word for variety. These small stores are either attached to the owner\u2019s house or in a small native cottage not far from the owner\u2019s home. Such stores are convenient for people in the barangay (village) who live far from the marketplace or town.\r\n<br>This kind of business has brought pleasure to Lorena\u2019s family. With its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s need. Being a good mother, Lorena always wanted to support her three children in whatever career they would choose to better their personal life. Aside from Lorena\u2019s variety store business financed by the loan she received from Kiva partner, ASHI, she also has a buy and sell business, which is her way of saving profits to support her family's needs, especially her children\u2019s education until college. With this in mind, Lorena is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase grocery items for her store and support her buy and sell business. This loan will help her businesses grow and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambitions in life.\r\n<br>Lorena has been an ASHI member since 2004. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve her living conditions through the income of her two businesses, both of which she has established with the support of previous loans. Her long-term goals are to have passenger jeepney (small bus) for added income, expand to a fully fledged grocery store, and give her children a better future. These dreams fuel her to continue her dedication to her ventures.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":632448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is a retired civil servant hence depends on his pension to cater for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 40,000 Kes through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase artificial insemination equipment for storing semen.

He says that he would like to own all kinds of artificial insemination equipment in future, acquire three motorcycles and employ three employees to enhance his profession.\r\n\r\nHe further comments that the cost of artificial insemination inputs is expensive hence farmers prefer to use the traditional bulls to service their animals.

U. is now requesting a new loan of 8,736,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  This will be her 3rd loan from SEDA.

Taking the support of my husband and my oldest son, I  opened my own shop. However, I have been through very hard times, and unfortunately I had to close my shop when I could not afford the rent. Back at home, I finished the remaining products by selling them to relatives, and I somehow managed to pay my debts.\" \r\n\r\n\"Just when I thought I was desperate, I discovered Maya. With the loans I borrowed from Maya, I bought new products from a wholesaler and I am back in business in my house. With the loans I borrowed from Maya, I can buy more products with a cheaper total price. My plans for the future are, if my affairs continue to go as fast and as well as they are going now, to open a shop--not in the city center but in a closer spot to my house--and to support my children and grandchildren as much as I can (by means of both financial and psychological support). My family is really important to me. I love my children and grandchildren so much.\"\r\n\r\nThis person\u2019s distinctive characteristics: an ambitious and unyielding woman.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\r\n\r\nSadiye Han\u0131m 55 ya\u015f\u0131nda ve evli.D\u00f6rt \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.En k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fc\u011f\u00fc 23 ve en b\u00fcy\u00fc\u011f\u00fc 35 ya\u015f\u0131nda.Ticarete ba\u015flamadan \u00f6nce ev han\u0131m\u0131yd\u0131m 4 \u00e7ocuk b\u00fcy\u00fctm\u00fc\u015ft\u00fcm ama maddi s\u0131k\u0131nt\u0131lar i\u00e7inde zorlan\u0131rken az az mal al\u0131p  evde sat\u0131yordum.Daha sonra d\u00fckkan a\u00e7maya karar verdim ba\u015flarken e\u015fimin ve b\u00fcy\u00fck o\u011flumun deste\u011fini alarak d\u00fckkan a\u00e7t\u0131m.

My group members are: Koser B. needs a loan for their grocery store, Haneefan B. requires a loan for their restaurant, Sughran B. wants to invest loan in her embroidery business.

She is married and the mother of two children. Shahodat started her business because she needed extra income to be able to pay for household and personal expenses, and she also needed her own income in order to afford her home. She began 6 years ago selling clothing for kids and shoes. As she had always liked sales, it went well after the business was started, and she has continued selling clothing since then. With the purpose of expanding her business, she is requesting a loan of 600 USD, which she is promising to repay over 9 months. This way, Shahodat hopes to earn more and to meet her children\u2019s expenses.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She uses her loans to procure goods.  She wants to repay the loan in eight months.  Her sales are good enough that she must restock often.

This was the experience of Manuela P. and her family when unavoidable circumstances forced them to move from the island of Panay to the village of Sitio Napulo, Barangay Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nWhen they lived in the Province of Iloilo, Manuela's husband earned his living through farming, but when they moved to Escalante, a seaside town where the main activity was fishing, they were like fish out of water. At first life was hard as they adjusted to their new life and new circumstances. Once they adapted to their new environment and assimilated into the local community, the couple started looking for better ways to support their family.\r\n\r\nOnce settled, she started making new friends in Escalante, and one of them invited her to do something that literally changed her life. When she said yes to her friend to attend an orientation at NWTF-Project Dungganon, Manuela opened a new door in her life. With 3 kids to raise and a family to support, she was receptive to new ideas, and when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997, she decided to invest her first loan into a fishing business, because she observed that it provided a decent living for most of her neighbors. Even with no previous experience, the couple was able to make a go of this new venture, and they were able to payback the first loan.\r\n\r\nStriving hard to move out of poverty, they kept focus on their goals, and as the loan amounts available to them increased because of their good business practices and prompt payments, they were eventually able to buy a motorized fishing boat which allowed them to go farther out to sea. They also bought additional fishing nets and crab traps, increasing their income potential.\r\n\r\nThe business earns a net income of PHP 4,000 per month which helps a lot in supporting their family. She just paid off her previous loan of PHP 7,000, her 8th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, which she used to buy fishing tools. Now she is borrowing PHP 9,000 for her 9th loan cycle to repair their fishing boat and nets so that she and her husband can continue earning a livelihood for their family of five.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She is a hard-working and enterprising mother who wants to get her children ahead.\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan to buy and sell merchandise like sweets, \u201cpanetones\u201d (an Italian sweet bread which is a Christmastime staple), cakes, and ice cream for the Christmas festivities.  That way she will be able to increase her business capital, have better income, and give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the opportunity provided to her and promises to complete her payments on the respective due dates.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 42 years old and lives with her family in Karabalta, a provincial town. Because of unemployment, many residents left town for the capital Bishkek or to go abroad to find work.  In these conditions, Lilia and her husband could secure their own work. They are engaged in agriculture. You may know, the local climate and landscape are pleasantly agreeable for raising livestock and agricultural activities. Lilia inherited some livestock and already for the duration of 20 years raising animals has provided them a fundamental source of survival. Owing to the fact that she owns her livestock, Lilia was able to provide her children an education. Their older son is 19 years old. He works in a \u201cpelmeni\u201d (ravioli) shop. The younger son is 17 years old. For the time being, he is at home and is not working. Both Lilia\u2019s sons actively participate in tending the livestock. Therefore, Lilia does not encounter any sort of difficulty in her work. Lilia applied for a loan, in order to purchase gasoline and motor oil for working plots of land in the spring. They want to buy gasoline and motor oil now, because in the spring they will be significantly more expensive. \r\n\r\nKamza S. is 52 years old. His wife works as a schoolteacher.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Pasikalia needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 35 talas or US $15 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nPasikalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Pasikalia's 7th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, this business was not very profitable and, 5 years ago, he decided to start another business in addition to fishing. He now also sells sand. Indeed, Elie contracted friends who go collect sand in the Cotonou lagoon with their small boats. Cotonou is the economic capital of Benin. Elie did already benefit from two loans from Kiva's partner Alid\u00e9, and, as a result, his standard of living improved. He's now seeking a third loan in order to increase his revenues.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He doesn\u2019t have a store but supplies the local Market directly from his home.  He learned about Hluvuku at the end of 2006 through some neighbors who are small business owners and he became interested in getting a loan for himself.  Currently his business of raising chickens is going well, but the number of chicks produced is very small given his financial limitations.  He employs one sales person and also counts on support from his wife.  The business of selling chickens is the primary source of income for the family\u2019s survival.  With a loan of 25,000MT he plans to increase the volume of the business by increasing the number of chicks produced which will increase his income capacity.  His business has a large impact on his community.  Besides providing employment, the community benefits from the animal protein sold at affordable prices.  With the growth of his business, he hopes to build a larger chicken farm, which would also create more job opportunities in the area.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Kiva volunteer Julie Lerch<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nGon\u00e7alves S. de 52 anos de idade, natural de Zamb\u00e9zia, cresceu sob responsabilidade dos seus Pais, a situa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira estava muito bem eram grandes criadores de gado bovino com boa oportunidades para estudar.

Even though, it's a seasonal job since there is some time during the year that embroideries are not very sought after. Regardless, she dedicates her time all throughout the year  to make the best embroideries so that she can sell them during the religious holidays in her area such as Fiesta de Santiago.  This is when the demand is very high for her beautiful embroideries since they're very high-quality.<p>\r\nShe wishes to continue working in this type of art taking advantage of the fact that there's a lot of tourism in the area where she lives.  She is always striving to provide a much better quality on each of her work of art.

When he finishes caring for his crops, he goes to help his father, because he wants to repay his father\u2019s efforts. \r\n<P>\r\nWhat his father likes best out of the whole agricultural process is the marketing, because he always hopes to get a good price for his crops. But once he gets to the market, he gets a little clumsy and sometimes loses track of the accounting. Abdunosir always tries to help him out with some pointers. The loan Abdunosir now is asking for is to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his varied crops. The loan will greatly improve Abdunosir\u2019s income and his family's living standards.\r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With continued profits, Rosa hopes to continue the growth of her business. This will help her to support her family, allowing her children to study and become professionals in anything they choose. Rosa is very grateful for her loans, saying that by investing into her business, her profits have grown and her business has become well known throughout her community. With her client base growing, Rosa looks forward to taking out more loans in the future.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Thank you for lending to Rosa and the Emprendedoras group!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":502627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To

To make a living, Mercedita runs a beauty salon. \r\n\r\nMercedita has been engaged in her business for 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. Mercedita joined PMPC in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase beauty products. \r\n\r\nMercedita is requesting a new loan of 45,000 PHP with which she will purchase equipment for her beauty salon. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Emily from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She currently lives with the youngest of her 6 children. Since she was a girl she has always been involved in agriculture. She plants a few vegetables but primarily she cultivates potatoes and corn, which produce the best selling harvest. She works every day but with the passage of the years she has also seen that it is more profitable to buy and sell livestock. This has been a business that she has had for the past 5 years, while she waits for the harvest to be ready. She sells on the weekends at the farmers fair. Whatever she doesn't sell she takes back to her stable and she uses for her own consumption. During these years of work she has seen that the sale of livestock runs fewer risks and earns greater profits. Therefore her goal is to increase her working capital. This is her eighth loan with MPF (Kiva Field Partner). She started out following a recommendation to work with loans so that she will profit from each investment that she makes in the field of livestock sales. Since then she has seen the great importance of having financial support in each project she sets herself out to do. At this opportunity the funds will be used to purchase more livestock because it is during this festive season of Santiago that the sales are most profitable."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":847549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

them does different work. The featured member is Vila, who is married to Teodoro, and has three children with him. Of the children, two are already married, and one is still in their care. \r\n\r\nVila requests the loan to purchase fabric for making dresses, blouses, skirts and other items to sell in communities near her town. She has been doing this work for one year and four months, and has had good results. Her neighbors inspired her to begin this business. They invited her to be a part of the group, and this encouraged her so she decided to start work selling clothing and thus help her husband with the household income. \r\n\r\nWhat she would like most is to be able, through her work and this loan, to continue working to support her son who is in school. She wants to support him until he is settled in a career. \r\n\r\nThe other women in the group are Mar\u00eda del rosario, who will invest the loan in purchasing ingredients for making tamales, and Faustina, who will purchase ingredients for making fried tacos and \"pozol\" [a pre-Hispanic drink made from fermented corn dough mixed with water].

He feels good about the confidence MFP has in him and is committed to paying back the loan on time.\r\n\r\nHe is glad to be able to count on this financial support as he knows he will be able to advance in his business or work.  He plans to use the 1,000 PEN loan to buy fruit to open a new business out of his home which will be run by his wife, in the hopes it will grow enough through hard work to turn it into a store. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":964570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fruit to start a new business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-28T10:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genrri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":114.49},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":114.71},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":111.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":123.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":127.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":128.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":137.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":142.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85.95,"local_amount":229.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":231.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246193},{"amount":41.87,"local_amount":111.66,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386209},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":123.15,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":124.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099300},{"amount":47.91,"local_amount":127.74,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":129.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713450},{"amount":48.23,"local_amount":128.63,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":129.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202338},{"amount":51.49,"local_amount":137.3,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":138.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098018},{"amount":53.37,"local_amount":142.32,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":143.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400914}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T16:42:18Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":380014,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruth de 31 a\u00f1os de edad,  labora para el Ministerio de Educaci\u00f2n impartiendo clases de secundaria desde hace 8 a\u00f1os a\u00f1os consecutivos,  es una profesora  bien trabajadora y  muy  responsable, este cr\u00e8dito lo  requiere para la instalacion de la energia electrica y la agua potable en su vivienda , y de esta manera lograr instalarse en su nueva casita segun referencias comerciales laborales y personales es bien dedicada a su trabajo y a su familia, cuenta con la ayuda del padre de sus hijos que se encuentra trabajando en Costa Rica ya que son una familia que lucha por habitar en su propio hogar, su mayor sue\u00f1o en la vida es que hogar este lleno de amor y habite la presencia de Dios.","en":"\r\nRuth, 31, has been working for the Ministry of Education teaching secondary school classes for 8 consecutive years.

Untungnya Samsuri memiliki ketrampilan menganyam bede, sehingga usaha ini ia teruskan untuk bisa menyambung hidup. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.500.000,Samsuri membeli bambu pada masyarakat sekitar,atau kadang-kadang kepelosok desa. Biasanya bede yang dihasilkan dibeli oleh masyakarat dari wilayah sekitar . Satu lembar bede yang terbuat dari kulit bambu dijual seharga Rp.225.000 sampai Rp.250.000,sedangkan kalau dari perut bambu dijual seharga Rp.150.000 Sampai Rp.175.000\/lembar. Dengan modal yang sedikit ,keuntungan yang didapat tentunya sedikit pula, Oleh sebab itu Samsuri ingin mengembangkan usahanya ini,kebetulan sekarang pesanan sedang banyak, makanya ia mengajukan pinjaman kepada Dinari untuk bisa membeli bambu yang lebih banyak,dengan harapan keuntungan yang didapat akan meningkat dan Samsuri juga sangat berharap dari keuntungan itu sedikit demi sedikit bisa menabung dan nantinya bisa memiliki rumah sendiri walaupun

This 51-year-old Neema M. from Mbeya. She is married with 6 children, between the ages of 26  and 32. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two  dependents because they are orphans. <P>\r\n\r\nNeema has been running a \u201cmachinga\u201d  business selling used clothing,  mitumba (cheap second-hand clothing), vitenge (traditional Tanzanian clothing) and shoes since 2006. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. \r\n\r\nThese second-hand clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything western or modern. Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.<P>\r\n\r\nNeema works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Neema currently earns about 20 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 475 USD in order to purchase more shoes and clothes for her business. In the future, she plans to to increase the quantity and quality of her clothing inventory. Neema thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":256310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more used shoes and clothes for her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T23:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436427},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130699},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027496},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613497},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:16Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010576},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":102916.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232867}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T00:22:58Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88228,"name":"Noemi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Noem\u00ed pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Zamaritanas\u201d, vive en el Jr. Jos\u00e9 Olaya N\u00ba 940, Distrito de Tarapoto, departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

Mar\u00eda dreams of making her business infrastructure better to offer good service and to start serving tourists who come to the area to visit the natural reserve of the P\u00f3mac forests.

The purpose of her current loan is to buy palm oil for bolstering her inventory. She is a merchant with highly diversified businesses. She has rented three twin stalls at the Guediawaye marketplace where she operates.\r\n\r\nBesides the palm oil that she markets, she also sells cloth and maintenance products, for example, detergents. She capitalizes on four years of experience in the field of poultry farming.\r\n\r\nShe supports the family because she is married and the mother of ten children, who vary in age from 9 to 31 years. Plus, she has another person in her care. For these reasons, she is more motivated during this period ahead of the holidays, such as Tabaski, Korite, or New Year's Day, when business is the most profitable.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to bolster her savings, to meet her personnel needs, to cover the costs of schooling her children, and to realize what she has always dreamed of, that is, to have her eldest son travel.\r\n<br

She lives alone in the city of Lambayeque, which is 20 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  She has operated a restaurant in her home since 2002.  She tells us that the business began as a  picanter\u00eda (a low-cost eatery specializing in beverages and small bites) which little by little she was able to enlarge.  A short time ago she had a pre-heart attack and she had to temporarily stop work because she needed absolute rest.  Unfortunately, after that health crisis she was diagnosed with diabetes but, far from being discouraged, the illness was the motivation for her to continue forward and a few months ago she reopened her eatery offering her customers prepared meals a la carte.  The income she earns is used for personal expenses and to maintain her business.  Ruth prepares very tasty dishes so her customers have refered her to others who are starting to frequent her small restaurant.  This situation has motivated her to want to enlarge her establishment but she lacks the funds to buy more ingredients to prepare more dishes.  This is why she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for her first, 1000 new sol, loan.  She dreams with overcoming her illness so that she can renovate the furnishings of her establishment making it into a great restaurant.  Ruth is very well-known and held in high esteem by her neighbors who consider her to be an optimistic and hard-working woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

It is comprised of five members who know each other and are neighbors. They are:\r\n<ul><li>Angela T.

B., who will buy Tupperware and shoes to stock up her business,<\/li>\r\n<li>Estela Guti\u00e9rrez C., who will buy ladies' shoes to stock up her store, because shoes are in high demand.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\nMs Juana Alicia Gonz\u00e1lez is 36 years old, studied until fifth grade and is married to an agricultural laborer. They have three daughters: Paulina is 15 and attends a three-year pre-university course, Brenda is 13 and attends high school, and Anais is 11 and goes to elementary school. Ms Juana Alicia has a food business; she sells pies, pozole (stew made with pork or chicken and corn), soft drinks, tostadas (fried corn pancakes) and dobladas. She applies for a loan to buy baking mixture, frozen meat, red meat, disposable glasses, plates and spoons to stock up her business. She started her business a year ago for economic reasons. She rented her premises within walking distance from her home, one and a half blocks away. Her business is important to her because she feels useful, has an income and learns to be independent. She loves to cook and gets a lot of satisfaction from preparing dishes for visiting people who can enjoy a tasty meal. She is proud that her business gives her all the necessary resources to provide for her daughters. Her daughters help her to prepare the dishes; the eldest girl attends school in the afternoon and the younger one in the morning. Her customers are all kinds of people, boys and girls, men and women, all in all she serves 30 to 40 customers a day. The earnings are used to invest in necessary ingredients, repay her loan and save some money. Her business helped her when she faced economic challenges, because she was able to pay for the girls' school and other expenses when her husband had no work. Her dream for the future is to expand her business and offer a greater variety of dishes. Ms Juana Alicia is very happy with the granted loan because it helps her to pay for what she needs. The improvement she wants to achieve is that her daughters become professionals and that she can invest in more food and earn an income from her work.\r\n\r\nThe residents of Jaloxtoc are nice and very quiet, there are no crimes and people love to help each other. The group members want to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you, and please keep on helping us with more loans. We are grateful for your trust.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":630216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase baking mixture, frozen meat, red meat, disposable glasses, plates and spoons to stock up her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JALOXTOC, AYALA; MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-11-06T15:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":8250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8329.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554998},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":5553.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691488},{"amount":450,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5553.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430672},{"amount":225,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2776.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849949}],"funded_date":"2010-11-08T13:42:24Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":248871,"name":"Concepcion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Concepcion C. is from the village of Brgy.

She is a very modest and kind woman who lives in her own home with her beloved son James who is one year old and who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.  Kely's grocery store is one of the most popular in her neighborhood.  She opens her store very early in the morning ready for her customers who come to buy the things they need.  Kely is a very happy and attentive shopkeeper who always greets her customers with a smile and is ready to help them with their purchases.\r\n\r\nWhat Kely most likes about her work is chatting to her customers.
