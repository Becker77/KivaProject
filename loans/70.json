","en":"Marziya is 49 years old.  She works as a Kyrgyz language and literature teacher at a school in the town of Isfana.  Due to the fact teachers' salaries are low and to find an additional source of income, she decided to start her own business of selling children's and teenage clothing at a local market in 2010.  She leased a container (retail space) and opens it every day during the second half of the day, thus, combining her business with her primary job.  Marziya's good selection of merchandise, friendly service and practical advice with clothing choice attract more and more customers.  In order to further grow her business, Marziya requested a loan in the sum of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand merchandise assortment by purchasing winter seasonal merchandise.  She plans to direct the profits from this loan to continued business

Having arrived in the United States, Mario had difficulties obtaining loans from banks due to his lack of credit history. Unfortunately this led him to more predatory lending options, forcing him to pay high interest rates and leaving him with little to send home to his family. However after seeing a Univision report on ACCION USA, he approached ACCION USA for a loan and was approved. Mario will use his ACCION USA loan to help him purchase wholesale inventory to sell.<P>\r\n\r\nMario is a firm believer that maintaining client relationships and offering good customer service are key factors in running a successful business. In the future Mario hopes to expand his business and hopes that his success will allow him to provide work for other entrepreneurs.

He began his business because he dropped out of school and needed some form of employment to get income to support his family.

Saffa now requires a new loan in order to buy more women's jeans and men's jeans. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000.

O., 38, is married with two children. Her primary business activity is a nursery school and a home care center. She started off with less than 10 children in 1998 and has since expanded to 60 children. She says that her main reason for starting the nursery\/baby care was because of her love for children and desire to see them grow and also for profit to take care of her family's needs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRose started off with a capital base of Ksh 5000\/= and has gradually ploughed back profits into her business over the years to allow her to reach to where she currently is. Her main challenge is lack of capital to cater to the increasing children seeking admission. This deficit is mainly in the learning facilities and feeding programme for the children. She thus intends to use the loan capital for this purpose while also using the profits from the business to help in meeting her family's needs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRose is the Chairman of the group she belongs to and she hopes to use her leadership skills acquired while managing the school to similarly ensure that the group remains cohesive to enable her to benefit from other loans in future. She has so far exhibited these leadership skills in marshalling the group together during the training sessions. Her business is in area called Muhoroni, almost 80 kilometres away from Kisumu town. This is the first loan she is taking with the Faida self help group but the training records from the loan officer indicate good attendance and participation by the group during group training sessions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":97505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"To expand learning facilities and feeding programme for her nursery school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":92,"posted_date":"2007-12-14T07:35:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3900,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen Odhiambo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-28T16:51:19Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":245000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":40833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":40833.33,"processed_date":"2008-01-28T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123500},{"amount":650,"local_amount":40833.33,"processed_date":"2008-02-28T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40885,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143991},{"amount":943,"local_amount":59239.74,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T19:42:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":59314.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281818},{"amount":1499.89,"local_amount":94223.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T01:07:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-02T07:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94343.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335041},{"amount":157.11,"local_amount":9869.74,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:37:51Z","rounded_local_amount":9882.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14881321}],"funded_date":"2007-12-14T16:51:19Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:37:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":31626,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Miriam produces chocolate which she sells in small cardboard packages in the city of La Paz and around the country. <p>\r\nHer home and workshop are located in the San Sebastian neighborhood in the city of La Paz. <p>\r\nThis is the first time she has requested a loan.

Now she is the main provider of her family and is busily selling and purchasing goods to keep her business running and to feed her children and her husband's parents.

All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy thirty sacks of potatoes and fifteen sacks of yams.

Her husband is retired and with much support, her small house is humble and already very old for lack of money. It hasn\u2019t been made with concrete. Thanks to God, she has been working as a professional nurse for 14 years although there have been many economic problems to attain her secondary education. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she started she worked as a hospital assistant and just advanced because she was passing a course. This was a big achievement that she can now work in what she likes and her income will be better. With this financing, she will buy rock, sand and cement to begin constructing a small kitchen which is much needed. Her plans are that she can finish her medical career although this is a costly career and it is for this reason that many students don\u2019t finish their studies due to economic reasons. \r\n<br

They intend to use it to buy three tons of cereal (beans, millet, corn, fonio), and packages of food condiments.\r\n\r\nThey mainly get their supplies from local producers. They then sell their products in Dioni and at the Konobougou market, in general for cash, to a customer base of both women and men.\r\n\r\nThey hope to achieve average monthly earnings of 17,500 FCFA each, which will be used to bolster their working capital and contribute to family expenses regarding food, children\u2019s education and healthcare.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":495177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bah      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yai           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modi\u00e8r\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan Denon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arahama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":127123.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021687},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":127123.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746485},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":127123.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779025},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":127123.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961229}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T04:00:03Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":184075,"name":"Matal United Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amie L. is the leader of this group of entrepreneurs from the township of Magburaka, northern Sierra Leone.

He lives with his family in their own house. The house has water and electricity and it is located in the urban zone of Pacanga, which belongs to the department of La Libertad. This zone is characterized by agriculture and cattle.\r\n\r\nFor 6 years Vicente has been selling recycled materials and grinding disposable bottles. He has his own grinder so he can do this work every day. He has his own clients he sells the product to.

When they are not harvesting, or their crops are not sufficient for their sales, she also purchases other vegetables wholesale to sell along with her own goods. Currently, she sells vegetables three days a week as that is the only time that there are tricycles to rent, which is how she gets to the market.

He sells his milk through the Kenya Cooperative Creameries and also earns some income from small-scale farming of cash crops.

Jenesusa is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional plastics & other recyclables to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jenesusa from HSPFI.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

During this time, she and her husband have brought in profits for their children, who are mostly all adults now\u2014except for the 2 who currently live with them. Her dependent children greatly support them with the arduous duties of the farm, particularly when looking after their livestock and overseeing their crop fields. She sells her produce wholesale and retail in her own stand at the local market. In the future, Sofia would like to become a prominent livestock farmer in her area, as well as have a greater amount of cattle in her stable so that her business can keep developing. This is the second time that she requests a loan from MFP.

He will use this loan to buy 5 bullocks which he will later sell when they reach the required weight to sell at a good profit.  He began as a basic grains farmer growing beans and corn.  His eldest son helped him with the farm work.  He has always worked and continues to plant beans and corn as well as some vegetables, like potato.  He hopes the purchase of these animals will increase his income for he will use the profits from their sale to buy still more cattle and thus increase his inventory.  Pablo Ram\u00f3n V\u00edlchez is married and his wife works as an elementary school teacher in a school located in Condega.  He has two sons and two daughters who are under his care.  He has had 10 loans since 2001 and has collaborated with Ceprodel for 10 years.  The beneficial impact of these loans has been considerable in that they allowed him to improve and diversify his work activities which, in turn, has led to improved quality of life in that he used to live in the countryside and now, with his earnings, has been able to buy a house in the city where he lives with his family.  This has allowed his children to be able to go to school and have greater opportunities in their lives.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":465703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 5 young bullocks to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T00:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pablo Ramon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":21000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":21000,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":21375.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191397068}],"funded_date":"2010-01-13T10:50:16Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:30:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":171259,"name":"Avelcan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Avelcan M. is from the village of Sicayab.

Together they live in the locality of Santa Rosa, specifically on the edge of the Peruvian forest where they have their own adobe made house. When she visualized the general store of her neighbors, she wishes to own one herself and eventually she managed as she did not finish her studies due to economic problems and therefore she only helped her parents with the farm and in exchange they gave her a tip for her personal expenses. Today she is happy as she feels she has succeeded in the first objectives, she even has customers that go to her establishment.

She runs a general store which she started a year ago when she noticed an empty stall in a busy area of the municipality. \r\n\r\nWhen Yennys began the business, she only had a glass cabinet and a few items for sale, but as she is a very self-disciplined person, she put the profits back into the business. In this way the business grew, as did the number of customers. They are enthusiastic about the products and the service she offers and buy more from her as each day goes by.\r\n\r\nYennys\u2019s dream is to have a large warehouse of goods which is well-known and in a good position. Her biggest challenge is the tough competition she faces in terms of prices and service.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She wishes to use the money to buy items in bulk such as cosmetics, accessories, perfume etc. In this way she will have more capital and will be able to sell on account.

She is married to Ricardo and they live with their 4 children who are 37, 32, 30, and 20 years old and a granddaughter whom they love very much. They all live comfortably in the house that they own. Loida works selling typical Peruvian fast food such as chifa (a fusion Chinese-Peruvian cuisine.) She began selling from a stand in the market in her town and, thanks to much work and dedication, and the addition of some capital, she was able to grow her business and opened a restaurant in the garage of her home two years ago. Today, she offers a quality service to her customers, catering buffets and events in people's homes. Her husband helps with the cooking and her children attend to the customers. What she likes about this work is that it keeps the family together, and the income enabled her to pay for her children's education, and they are her great priD.. On the other hand, she is very happy with the big welcome that her restaurant has received, and for this reason she has plans to extend and improve the premises of her business to offer greater comfort to her customers. This will be her 5th loan from the institution MFP and she is grateful for the financial support that has permitted her to proceed with her business.

This is 38-year-old Ritha M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children between the ages of 1 and 8. Ritha has been running a poultry business since 2003. \r\n\r\nKuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, seven days per week. Ritha currently earns about US$300 from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Ritha thanks you for your support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":271614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He has a small husker (a machine that takes the shells off and refines the grains) that he uses for his grains after the harvest.  Alexander has the support of all of his family for his agricultural work, and that makes him extremely satisfied.  Also, he really likes his work, which he has been involved in since he was very small.  This business is profitable because he takes his products (rice, corn, beans, and other grains) ready for sale to the market, and he receives a good price for his work.  \r\n\r\nLater, Alexander would like to also raise cattle.  \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He likes working with his community bank because it gives him confidence, and all of the members are very responsible.  He will use the loan to buy more grains (seeds) to plant.

For this reason his customers come to his establishment to buy the bread, fresh out of the oven, and they also consume other breakfast food products such as: milk, yogurt, and sausages, among others, generating good earnings.  Juan feels very content with the work that he does, and for this reason he has plans to buy better utensils and tools to expedite the making of bread.  As he says, every effort is valid, as long as it helps the family to get ahead.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he pledges to be very punctual with each of his payments.  With the loan he requests, he will invest in ingredients needed to make bread and he will also restock his store with merchandise, thus hoping to obtain good earnings.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":530887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make bread, and to restock his store  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":206.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":210.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":221.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":226.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":236.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":242.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":251.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":264.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":269.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":281.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":291.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":297.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.05},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.53},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.04,"local_amount":206.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":210.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751997},{"amount":75.45,"local_amount":210.55,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":214.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934453},{"amount":79.27,"local_amount":221.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":225.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673221},{"amount":81.05,"local_amount":226.18,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":230.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887048},{"amount":84.88,"local_amount":236.89,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:30Z","rounded_local_amount":241.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154063},{"amount":87.05,"local_amount":242.93,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":247.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449337},{"amount":90.21,"local_amount":251.73,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":256.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588069},{"amount":94.65,"local_amount":264.15,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":269.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724685},{"amount":408.4,"local_amount":1139.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1160.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462900}],"funded_date":"2010-05-17T06:13:23Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":200511,"name":"Tomas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tomas S. lives in the town of Sto.

Her dream is to finish providing her young children with an education.  Although working in the field is not easy, she is happy to have the opportunity to get her family ahead.

expresses a sincere appreciation to all social investors from Kiva, who supported Mamlekat in her business by financing her Kiva credit lines.  Mamlekat was born in the city of Karabalta (Jaiyl district, Kyrgyz Republic).  She has been a widow since 1987 and lives with her youngest son.  Mamlekat was born into a family of a veterinarian and a milkmaid.  Since young age, she had helped her parents with the household and was an independent child.  She got married in 1977 at the age of 20.  Her husband and she lived with his parents in the Stepnoe village (45 km north of Karabalta).  Their son Anvar was born one year later.  Mamlekat's husband worked at the \"Hammer and Sickle\" collective farm and helped Mamlekat get a job of a milkmaid there.  With time, they moved away from the parents and relocated to the city of Karabalta, where they bought a small house nearby a collective farm, where they both worked.  Their second son Ildar was born in 1987.  Also this same year, Mamlekat's husband passed away due an incurable sickness.  She steadfastly lived through this period, continued working as a milkmaid at the collective farm and also kept a dairy cow, given to her by the collective farm, at home.  Her sons grew and so did their needs.  Her salary was no longer enough to support the family, and this why she decided to start her own business.  in 1991, Mamlekat sold her house, all of the remaining livestock (two dairy cows and two bulls) in Karabalta and bought an abandoned shed 5 km away from the Stepnoe village.  Mamlekat's parents helped a little with fixing up the shed and also with buying first few calves.  This is how Mamlekat has been involved in breeding cattle in her own shed over the period of ten years.  Currently, Mamlekat has 13 dairy cows, 25 bulls, 10 calves and 2 horses, and also several goats.  She married off her son two years ago, and he now lives with his family in her parents' house and takes care of them.  In order to further increase her livestock quantity, Mamlekat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  She plans to buy young bulls for fattening up.  With time, Mamlekat dreams of increasing her cattle headcount and helping her son to buy a house in Karabalta."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":869950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Stepnoe village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamlekat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8008},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7477},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":7658},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":7843},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8032},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8226},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8425},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8629},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8837},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9051},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9269},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":8545}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.36},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.39},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.62},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.39},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":178.18,"local_amount":8008,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":8033.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751293},{"amount":166.36,"local_amount":7477,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7501.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555517},{"amount":170.39,"local_amount":7658,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7682.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514680},{"amount":174.51,"local_amount":7843,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7868.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722485},{"amount":178.71,"local_amount":8032,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":8057.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125417},{"amount":183.03,"local_amount":8226,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":8252.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250563},{"amount":187.46,"local_amount":8425,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":8452.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975536},{"amount":191.99,"local_amount":8629,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8656.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816116},{"amount":196.62,"local_amount":8837,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8865.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072134},{"amount":597.75,"local_amount":26865,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":26951.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370720}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T17:26:38Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":339851,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is in her fifties.
