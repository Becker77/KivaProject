The milk is used for cheese production. Approximately 80 kg of traditional Georgian cheese is sold per month. Also, they own 2 ha of land, where maize is grown; four tons of maize is harvested annually, 0.5 tons of which is sold on the market. The rest of the corn is used in the family. Along with the above-mentioned, Ilia and Maya grow strawberries on a plot with an area of 400 sq. meters. Approximately 300 kg of strawberries are sold during the season. \r\n\r\n500 Laris from the requested credit will be used for tilling and fertilizing the land. After the above-mentioned processes, Ilia and Maya will get more and better quality harvest and sell it for a higher price. That will positively impact the income of the family. With the remaining 700 Laris Ilia and Maya will purchase a new refrigerator for their house. \r\n\r\nThe received profit will be used for expansion of the dairy farm.

worked as a nurse for 15 years, but she began to have arthritis in her hands and knees from the work and had to quit the job. As a single mother, she still had to take care of her three children and provide for their education, so she started selling used clothing and toys in January 1987. She had some sales experience because previously she had sold cosmetics in her free time. Back then, she needed to sell many items to able to cover her expenses, so she went to the outskirts of local markets (she couldn't afford to pay for a post inside). With a lot of hard work she was able to set up outposts in all the open markets in the region and a larger space to sell her goods. <p>\r\nWith Christmas time fast approaching, Alicia wants to offer a wider variety of the toys children want. She is requesting a loan of $850, which she plans to repay within six months, to purchase more supplies for her customers. With your help Alicia can grow her small business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nAlicia trabaj\u00f3 15 a\u00f1os como enfermera pero comenz\u00f3 a enfermarse de reumas en las manos y en las rodillas por el esfuerzo que hac\u00eda en el trabajo y tuvo que dejar de trabajar, pero como es madre soltera de tres hijos, y ten\u00eda que mantenerlos y darles estudio, comenz\u00f3 a dedicarse a la venta de ropa usada y de juguetes.

In 1997, she joined the Fund and asked a loan to invest into breed pigs and poultry breeding. Besides her main occupation of daily breeding, Mrs. L\u00e1 also works as a daily worker for various businesses in the region. After 10 years with the Fund, and through her own efforts, she managed to grow up her child and their conditions of life have also gradually stabilized.

It was founded in 2003. Today, it has a total of 580 pupils (both female and male) with a staff of sixteen teachers. This Agricultural Secondary School is the only secondary school in the whole Kasonko Chiefdom. Once pupils graduate from the school (which is a Junior Secondary School \u2013 JSS), they then move to a senior secondary school in Kabala (twenty-five miles from Fadugu), which is the nearest  big town to Fadugu. Others go to other bigger towns like Makeni, Bo, Kenema, or Freetown. The school teaches mainly agriculture which is the primary occupation of the people of Fadugu. \n\nSince it is the only secondary school in the chiefdom, accommodating the pupils has become a problem for the school. The school lacks enough buildings to house the growing number of pupils within and around the whole chiefdom. Staffing too is another problem facing the school; almost all of the teachers in the school are unqualified. In addition to these problems, the library lacks the required textbooks.\n\n\nNotwithstanding these constraints facing the school, this secondary school prides itself on producing 100% passes at the Basic Education Examination (BECE) for the academic years of 2005 \u2013 2007. Though the school may lack trained and qualified teachers (since it is in a small town,; the few qualified and trained teachers in the country prefer teaching in bigger towns), it has determined, dedicated and willing teachers who are willing and ready to assist the children to make the grade. \n\nPatrick M.

She is 22 years old. Genelyn is married. To make a living, Genelyn raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Genelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years with approximate average monthly earnings of 4,000 Philippine pesos for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Genelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Genelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to pay for services in cultivating the farm to increase crop yield. Genelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the second loan taken out by Genelyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Minerva is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Minerva from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Her open-hearted personality and attentive attitude to patients helped her to acquire an excellent reputation as a medic.  As salaries in rural areas are low,  people need to find an additional means to lift themselves from the poverty level. For this reason, Kuljamal and her family started their own business in cattle breeding. At present, the farm has 13 sheep and one milch cow.  Kuljamal is also engaged in cultivating apples, pears, raspberries, and currants, all of which were planted 15 years ago.  Today her family works hard to get a good harvest.  These activities allowed Kuljamal to improve her household, but she still needs a loan of 60,000 KGS to buy 10 sheep and one colt. Revenues from this loan will allow Kuljamal to send her children to the capital city of Bishkek in order to get a good education.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Sisanya dipakai untuk membeli pakan babi.Dalam kurun waktu 6 bulan babi sudah siap untuk dipanen pendapatan kotor yang didapat dari penjualan babi Rp.2.800.000,-sedangkan modal yang dikeluarkan Rp.1.500.000,-.Keuntungan bersih Rp 1.300.000,- per 6 bulan. Dari hasil usahanya ini Ni Ketut Sriani bisa menyisihkan uangnya untuk persiapan  biaya sekolah anaknya

She is 51; single, and the mother of 3 children who are 35, 32, and 25.  None of them goes to school.   She didn't go to school because her parents didn't have the financial resources to send her.  She lives in her own home with her family and also supports 2 grandchildren who live with her.  She left the province of Gaza for Maputo in 1987 in search of better living conditions after the death of president Samora Machel.  Afterwards, she constructed her home in neighborhood 5 in Boane in the province of Maputo.  She has had her own business selling basic goods for more than 3 years.  She also practices traditional medicine, which is known as curandeira.  With these activities, she make a monthly profit of 5,000 meticais, which she uses to support her family.  She also saves some every month through a traditional rotating savings program.  She has never had a loan with another insitution.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through a friend.  This is her 7th loan, and it is for 15,000 meticais.  She will use it purchase merchandise (rice, margarine, sugar, peanuts, etc.) to respond to market demand.  Her previous loans ( 4 for 15,000 meticais, 1 for 10,000 meticais, 1 for 5,000 meticais, and 1 for 2,500 meticais) went towards her business and housing needs.

The following sections describe the various activities they carry out each day: \r\n\r\nAlejandrina Maria D. works in trade, and her main activity is selling groceries. Her business operates under the name \"Pulper\u00eda DINORA\" [\"Dinora General Store\"]. Alejandrina has worked in this business for several years, and her excellent management during this time has been noteworthy.  With the income from her business, she helps her husband with the expenses of their household and children. Mrs. D\u00edaz' husband works in agriculture, since it is one of the most productive areas of all of the zone of El Coyolar Jutiapa. Her business is one of the best-stocked in the community of Coyolar, containing all of the basic necessities for daily life, such as sugar, rice, shortening, soap, coffee, sauces, spaghetti, meat, sausages, cheese, butter, etc. \r\n\r\nMarta Facunda M. has worked in her business for several years. Her main activity is a small general store, which operates under the name of \"Pulper\u00eda M..\u201d Marta tells us that she began with just a few products in her store, but she has gradually been able to expand it. She has invested her earnings back into her business, and in this way she has been able to make it bigger and bigger. Her business include the most necessary items for daily consumption, such as sugar, soap, shortening, rice, coffee, spaghetti, sauces, toilet paper, chicken, meat, sausages, etc. Her store is located in the house where she lives, and with the profits she receives, she has helped her 2 children get ahead. Her live-in partner, Marco Ruiz, is a beef butcher and farmer. She will use the loan to buy more merchandise on a wholesale basis and thus expand her store's inventory. \r\n\r\nMariana del Carmen M.

Mariana has a daily contract, from Monday through Friday, for at least L.180.00 worth of tortillas from the owner of the food stand at the Multipurpose Institute in the municipality of Jutiapa, plus what she sells within the community where she lives.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Due to their painful and miserable life, she was forced to work hard in order to have an income for their food.  When her son died, she really felt hopeless. However, she needed to move on and was forced to apply for a loan in one of the institutions with a higher interest just to cope with the financial needs of her family. But it seems that they were abused by the financial institution; many of her group mates had missed their payment and their savings was used to pay the unpaid balance. \r\n\r\nWhen ASHI encouraged her to take the opportunity to have a loan she was hesitant at first because of her bad experience.

H\u1eb1ng has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $145 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, H\u1eb1ng joined TYM Fund, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  H\u1eb1ng has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase young livestock to raise and sell in the future.  H\u1eb1ng is now requesting a new loan of $700 which will be used to purchase breeding livestock.  The loan will be the tenth loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.

His salary alone was not enough for them to provide the necessary conditions for their children to succeed.\r\n<p>\r\nSeeing that she had the support her husband, Do\u00f1a Ana decided to continue her business.  Thanks to both of their incomes, their 18 year old daughter is in college shaping her own future.

Hawa's difficulty is the rainy season, because when it rains she doesn't really get customers because it is said that Liberians are afraid of rain.\r\n\r\nHawa is requesting a loan to buy more food ingredients such as tins of oil, seasoning, pepper and bags of rice, to improve her business.

Despite the economic crisis, they aim to support the schooling of their children so that they will find a stable job someday.

To earn additional income Erlinda ventured in the buying and selling of dry goods like blankets, towels and floor mats.

Unable to meet the material needs of her children, she sought assistance from GHAPE when she joined the program in 2004. Her dedication to the program is unquestionable and her hard work has had untold results on her family's situation.\r\n\r\nWith her new loan, she plans to repair her pig sty, buy more three more piglets, pig feed and coffee from neighboring villages. There are a lot of small-scale coffee farmers in neighboring villages whose products are too small to attract coffee-processing firms. She plans to go to them, buy the coffee from several farmers, and resell to the coffee cooperative society in Mbengwi, which serves as a collection centre for coffee processing firms. The profit she gets from the loans will be used to educate her children and provide food for her family.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":539806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy piglets, pig feed, and coffee","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Njembeng, Mile 18, Mbengwi, NW.

After three solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area (Association MALI BOMO de Wayerma II), she is now on her fourth individual loan for stocking and marketing.  All of her preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she intends to buy two sacks of corn, three sacks of sorghum, two sacks of peanuts, two sacks of <i>fonio<\/i>, four sacks of millet, etc.  Supplies of these goods are gotten in Z\u00e9goua and in towns surrounding Sikasso.  The goods are  then stocked in her store located at the marketplace in her district in order to be resold at the retail level.  Customers are generally the heads of households. \r\n\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":322191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy grains (millet, corn, peanuts, sorghum, etc.) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":31467.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678843},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31467.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028203},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":31467.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763284},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":31467.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991012},{"amount":65,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":31467.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746134}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T00:54:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":113698,"name":"Flery","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flery V. is from Antipolo, the capital city of the Rizal Province in the Philippines.

Her business acumen is obvious in that for the past four years, her choices have always paid back for her and her family.\r\n\r\nErna is determined to work hard and build her business so that her family's financial standing will be on stable ground that can provide a good life for her and her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FOR HER GENERAL STORE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cadiz, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-07-31T10:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136,"local_amount":6240,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6536.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73648899},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3268.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088264},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3268.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004013},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3268.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848791},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4085.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739464}],"funded_date":"2009-08-06T10:23:20Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:02:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elrico Mu\u00f1oz","image":279082}},{"id":130096,"name":"Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aurora es socia del Banco Comunal \u201c21 D.

at multiple coffee shops. At the beginning of this year, he and his business partner, Jarrod, jointly purchased their first cafe. They located themselves across the street from a train station, taking note that, while the area did have a few coffee shop chain stores, they didn't offer the \"coffee house\" vibe that Alfredo and Jarrod planned to bring to the neighborhood, with specialty drinks and great live music.\r\n\r\nAs of now, Alfredo and Jarrod are breaking even with their business that specializes in coffee, tea, pastries, and smoothies (a blended, chilled beverage made from fresh fruit or vegetables). They have some regulars and their foot traffic is steadily increasing, but they feel they could really take their business to the next level with some advertising in print media, on television, and through direct mail postcards that would help increase their visibility.\r\n\r\nBy drawing more people to their shop, they hope to grow their cafe and turn it into a place that neighborhood patrons love to frequent as a unique place not only to get a great cup of coffee but also to catch local live music

She is 28 years old, married and the mother of a 8 year old boy who goes to school. She studied until 10th grade but had to drop school because she got pregnant and had to had a surgery during her pregnancy. She lives in her own house with her family and a sister who lives with them. She also helps her parents who still live in Maputo with money for food.\r\nShe left Maputo to start a new life in Boane with her husband in 1998. She has had her own business since 2004, where she sells meals, burgers and refreshments. She makes around 9.000,00MT (U$290) per month, that she uses to support her household and put some away in a savings account. She has had other loans with the credit cooperative THUMA but was unsatisfied with them. She found out about Hluvuku through a friend who's also a client. \r\nThis is her third loan in the amount of 10.000,00MT (U$350) that she'll use to buy more food products (chicken, fish, meat, soft drinks, beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages) to diversify what she sells and improve her business. Her other loans were for the same purpose.\r\nOne of Paula's dreams is to buy a tilting carriage in order to carry sand and rocks and sell it around. In the future she would like to get more loans in order to improve her business and finish building her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She is separated from her husband and lives in her own home together with two of her four children.  For more than four years she has been renting out her motorcycle taxi to close family members who pay her by the day to use it.  Luz has been saving part of this money so that she can cover any repairs the motorcycle might need.  She uses some of her money to deal with any problems the vehicle might have and uses the rest to educate her children in the hope that they will become professionals in the future and thereby improve their opportunities in life.  In order to achieve this goal, she also started selling beauty products to her family members and friends in her neighborhood.  This business is doing well.  However, at the moment she doesn't have enough money to invest in it.  She needs to have products in stock so that she can energize her business and make it more profitable.  In the future, she would also like to rent a stall and sell sweet treats from it with her daughter's support.\r\n\r\nThis is Luz's 16th loan with MFP and she reaffirms her pledge to continue making her repayments on time so that she can access further loans in the future.  Luz will use the loan that she is requesting to buy beauty products.  She will also fix her vehicle's engine."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":741967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

He and his wife work together with a family member in the shop. He needs many helpers to speed up the work and to meet the demand and the various orders that have been placed. Sometimes he wants to hire two more people to help him with his project. He enjoys his business. As a boy he learned to value family support and it has given him the opportunity to enjoy happy moments with them. For the years of experience in the business he has fixed clients who always request these skirts and he also earns new clients. He hopes to purchase a new sewing machine. This is his third loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is happy to know that he is part of a group of people who consider him to be part of their family. He can learn much from them which is why he has decided to keep working these next months with his communal bank.

She is a married woman with a child, and her only son has already grown and doesn't live with his parents.\r\n\r\nYsabel has had her business for approximately 10 years, which she started after saving enough capital to open the business from clothing sales at first. Now she is also selling catalog products from a very popular brand, and she is buying to resell.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing cosmetic and household products. She might buy body lotion, hair and body wash, and others from the same catalog.

He is married and has seven children.  All of his children are doing well.  The older sons have their own families, and from time to time assist him.  Olaberdi studied both teaching and bookkeeping in college.  He works in a school as a bookkeeper, but he has not received his salary since the beginning of the year. Therefore, at home he keeps a large herd of cows and goats, which he puts out to pasture; however, the young ones stay close to home, as it is difficult for them to travel a long ways.  The loan he took out was for the purchase of cattle, and with this money he bought six cows.  Olaberdi is grateful to Kiva for the support, and plans to remain a client of MicroInvest in the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":309694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-10T06:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olaberdi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1600},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":410},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":410,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1615.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001026},{"amount":410,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1615.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846259},{"amount":410,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1615.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737349},{"amount":410,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1615.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127050},{"amount":410,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1615.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123964060}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T16:09:14Z","paid_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":109618,"name":"Stella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stella, 35 and married with five children, owns a boutique where she sells bags and clothes.
