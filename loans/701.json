The couple have five children but only care for three of them.  They all live in the warmth of their own home which is located in the small village of Cochayoc, in Acobamba district.  Laberiano and Mar\u00eda started working their land when they first got together.  Each of them learned the business from their family.  Once they got together, they started growing their own crops for their own benefit and that of their children.  On land which he owns, Laberiano grows peas, potatoes, spinach, turnips, <i>ollucos<\/i> (a native tuber), carrots and other crops.  The crop which makes him the most income is the peas because they flower and grow in their pods quickly.  They are also in high demand in the city of Tarma. \r\n\r\nIn parallel with this work, Laberiano also raises cattle.  In his stables he has 5 cows, 2 bulls and 5 sheep which he fattens and then sells in the city.  \"We buy young bulls, graze them and fatten them over a period of 6 months to 1 year, depending on the size, and then we sell them\", he says.  This tenacious father tells us that the difficult times he has experienced were as a result of a lack of capital, the bad distribution of fertilizers on his land and a lack of insecticides.  For this reason, he has learned to cope with these factors in his planting and harvesting.  \"I hope to buy a used car in the future so that I can save money on paying to transport my produce\", he says.  This is one of his goals for the next couple of years.\r\n\r\nThis will be Laberiano's 9th loan from MFP and he needs your help.  For his part, he pledges to make his repayments on time.  'Cochayoc Centro' is the name of his community bank and he feels comfortable there working alongside his fellow members as they share the same interests.  Laberiano will be able to start his December, January and February sowing.  He will buy 10 sacks of fertilizers to enrich two of his plots of farmland."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":905306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 10 sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laberiano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2037,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202058}],"funded_date":"2011-11-20T22:02:27Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":355970,"name":"Nelson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelson is a hardworking businessman aged 58.

On the other hand, she doesn't like it when a day's work doesn't bring in enough fish to cover the fishing expenses. Oftentimes, the waxing moon makes the fish scarce, but she doesn't get discouraged and she continues planning to stay in the business. This will be her first loan with the MFP institution and she hopes to have your contribution to meet her goals. She also remarks that she is pleased with her communal bank, since she considers her group to be close and cooperative. With the amount she has asked for, 1000 nuevos soles, she plans on investing in buying used clothing wholesale, as well as in buying fishing materials such as traps and nets.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":966051,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy used clothing and fishing materials such as nets and traps.

A popular tourist attraction in Homa Bay county is Ruma National Park, a game reserve that is home to the rare roan antelope, a shy species distantly related to the reticulated giraffe.

Very early on, she started small business activities to meet her own needs. As she had very limited means, she chose an activity that requires very few resources: preparing and selling maize porridge, donuts and cake. Later she got married to alleviate her hardship. But she realized later that she had chosen the wrong husband. The man abandoned her with nine (9) children. Staggering under the burden, she can no longer cope and is seeking help. Despite the profitability of her business, revenue is very scanty compared to her household\\\\\\'s needs. To increase the revenue, she got a credit of $150 that she managed very well and paid back successfully. The second credit of $300 gave her a breath of fresh air and allowed her to sell essential products in addition to porridge. \r\n\r\nThe credit of $550 she is requesting will allow her to buy wheat flour, sugar, rice, oil cans and other consumer products.

Limit\u00e9e par les moyens, elle choisit une activit\u00e9 qui ne demande pas beaucoup d\u2019argent : la pr\u00e9paration et la vente de bouillie de ma\u00efs, de beignets et de g\u00e2teaux. Entre temps, elle se maria pour att\u00e9nuer ses peines. Elle se rendra compte plus tard qu\u2019elle a choisit le mauvais homme. Aujourd\u2019hui, m\u00e8re de neuf (09) enfants, elle est abandonn\u00e9e par son mari. Ecras\u00e9e par toutes ces charges, elle n\u2019en peut plus et crie au secours. Malgr\u00e9 la rentabilit\u00e9 de son activit\u00e9, le revenu est tr\u00e8s insignifiant par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019importance des besoins de son m\u00e9nage.

With this money and supplemental loans from family they have been able to buy an automobile with the goal of offering freight service to people in need. Because of these bold business ventures the family\u2019s finances are relatively good compared to local standards.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The community of Set Net Point is located north of the city of Bluefields and is 3 hours away by motorboat.  This area historically has not had access to electricity service.  ADEPHCA has partnered with Blue Energy to seek funding through Kiva to purchase the following electrical materials:\r\n<p>\r\n\u2022\tblades with 2 fuses that costs $12 USD each\r\n\u2022\tcharge controllers that costs $35 USD each\r\n\u2022\t11 Watt lamps that costs $10 USD each\r\n\u2022\tlight bulb clamps that cost $1 USD each\r\n\u2022\tlight switches that cost $1 USD each\r\n\u2022\t#14 electrical wiring that costs $51 USD for 11 beneficiaries\r\n<p>\r\nIt is hoped that this funding will allow these families to take advantage of electricity service so that they can improve their standard of living and perform their household chores at night.

She lives in Mankon, North West Region, Cameroon. The family shares 2 rooms. She, as many other people, has faced major challenges in her life, especially when her parents and brothers died. She has also suffered from the hands of early marriage. She got pregnant at a stage when she did not expect and dropped out of school. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan, Ngang Eunice expanded her business of sewing uniforms for school children, particularly those at the primary level. She was so happy with the fact that she was able to provide the school needs to her children, while many people around her find it difficult to do so. Given a loan, she plans to buy more fabric and produce more uniforms for school children that she will take to far-off villages. She will be able to sell there since very few persons go so far to do this particular business. Ngang Eunice hopes the business will succeed with the experiences she has in doing this for so many years and the location of her business site in the central town. Also, she is able to withstand the stress of traveling to far-off villages.\r\n\r\nShe will put the proceeds from this loan toward catering for her children's needs. She will ensure that her health and that of her children is taken care of by paying for their education. \r\n\r\nShe prefers loans from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE gives and the ease of obtaining and paying back.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":808620,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"purchase materials for sewing uniforms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Small Mankon, Bamenda, NW.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to secure food for her family and to have additional maize profits to send her children to school. With income from maize sales, Janerose will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing as savings for future use.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Umoja group will each plant maize plots of between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Janerose with her group members and the person on the far left is the field officer. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":931714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-28T14:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janerose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kennedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nenice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":39200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":39200,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":40635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681112}],"funded_date":"2011-12-12T16:53:23Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":368275,"name":"Flordeliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flordeliza is married with 4 children.

He is a happy and friendly person who lives with his partner, Lety, who is a storekeeper, his father, his mother, and his four siblings in his parents' home.  Ca\u00edn works in transportation for a living with the mototaxi he bought with his savings one year ago.  He wakes up very early for work to look for passengers in the city's streets.  He works until noon, when he returns to rest, only to set out again later for a few hours in the afternoon.  He likes his work because he controls his free time and he tells us that he decided on this work because he needed a trade and income because he needed many things and he had expenses he couldn't afford.  Now he feels more calm and comfortable because he has steady income and because he has more free time.  On the other hand, he tells us that when it rains hard it's inconvenient for him because it makes his work more difficult, but he doesn't get discouraged and keeps on working.

She opted to become a smallholder farmer. Fifteen years ago she started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Githego, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of two children sells milk, eggs, vegetables and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Joanina believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

Desak Putu Arsini is determined to keep her children in school, and fights for this will by starting her business to make sweets for Hindu worshippers. She has this opportunity because people in her neighborhood are Hindu, and they need the ceremonial sweets almost every month. <p>With a starting capital of $100, Desak Putu Arsini started her business. She buys sweets ingredients, such as flour, sugar and sticky rice, as well as drying tools at the market. Since her capital is small, she can only produce small amount of sweets, and thus, she only gains small profits, which are just enough to bring food to the table. Because of this capital limitation, Desak Putu Arsini cannot serve her customers to the maximum, while there are many people who need the sweets. That is why she requested a loan from DINARI Foundation with hope that she can serve even more customers and gain more profits. Desak Putu Arsini wants to send her children to the highest education possible, and hopes to save up for buying her own house.

Setiap tahun Desak Putu Arsini harus mengeluarkan uang sebesar Rp.1.000.000.- untuk membayar sewa rumah. Pekerjaan suaminya sebagai sopir angkot tidak dapat mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga, apalagi sekarang  muatan sudah sepi karena kebanyakan masyarakat sudah mempunyai sepeda motor sendiri. Karena keinginan Desak Putu Arsini supaya anak-anaknya bisa bersekolah, maka ia berjuang keras dengan membuka usaha membuat kue-kue untuk sembahyang umat Hindu. Peluang ini didapat karena dilingkungan Desak Putu Arsini semua masyarakatnya memeluk agama Hindu, yang hampir setiap bulan memerlukan kue-kue tersebut. Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1.000.000 Desak Putu Arsini memulai usaha ini. Bahan \u2013bahan seperti tepung,gula ,ketan ,alat-alat penjemuran dibeli di pasar. Dengan modal sedikit, tentu saja kue yang dihasilkan juga sedikit sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh tentu pula sedikit dan hanya cukup untuk keperluan dapur saja. Karena keterbatasan modal tersebut maka Desak Putu Arsini tidak dapat melayani pelanggan dengan maksimal,sedangkan masyarakat yang membutuhkan kue sangat banyak. Oleh sebab itu Desak Putu Arsini mengajukan pinjaman Modal Kepada Yayasan Dinari, dengan harapan dapat melayani masyarakat lebih banyak lagi sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih banyak pula. Dan Desak Putu Arsini dapat menyekolahkan anak-anaknya ke jenjang yang lebih tinggi,dan ia mempunyai keinginan untuk dapat menabung agar nantinya bisa mempunyai rumah sendiri. Desak Putu Arsini sangat berterimakasih atas pinjaman yang diberikan Oleh Yayasan Dinari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":136955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious

She has never attended school nor learned a trade.  At her mother's side, she started as an adolescent selling balls of \"p\u00e2te\" , commonly called \"akassa\"  (similar to polenta made with boiled corn meal) and served with fried fish.  Seven years ago, she switched her business to selling cassava flour (gari) and two types of roasted peanuts (arachide and cacahu\u00e8te).  This switch came about in her previous business due to an accelerating drop in sales.  So, increasing the capital of her new business and better meeting customer demands are the reasons why she is requesting this third loan of 100,000 francs CFA.

She lives in the village of Cetireni, along with her husband.  Ms. T. worked as a cook in the school in the village, then she worked for nearly 2 years in Moscow. Because of the instability of jobs in Moscow, Ms T. returned to her own country. And because she has a lot of land, 3 hectares, and room for animals, she decided to grow pigs. Last year she sold 4 pigs, but she currently owns 15 pigs, 3 of the biggest pigs and 12 small pigs. <P>\r\n\r\nMs. T.  began to grow pigs about a year ago. She has requested a loan worth 10,000 lei, 5000 lei of which will be used to rebuild her pigpen (she wants to increase its size), and 5000 lei to buy feed for pigs, sheep, and cattle. <P>\r\n\r\nPigs are kept till they reach the weight of 100-120 kg, bringing a price of 40 lei \/ kg. So a mature pig can bring in about 4000 lei. Expenditures for growing pigs and maintaining them are reduced, because she has agricultural land which mainly provides food for the pigs. At the end of the first year of ACTV, calculated, she will collect a cumulative net flow of 11,480 lei, and at the end of the second year's activity, the cumulative net flow will be worth

Currently, she is living in her parents\u2019 house, until she can buy herself a plot of land or a house.  Since she was 17 years old, she sold beauty products to her friends.  She studied to be an executive secretary at a technical institute and, during this time, she met a shoe supplier in Trujillo famous for the quality and variety of shoewear they make.  With a great deal of hope, she started in this business but at first did not have customers.  Since she started working at her local municipality, her shoe orders have increased.  She offers her products, noting the style number and size that the customer requires, and at night after work she delivers her orders taking care of customers who know her and seek her out from 7 pm to 11 pm.  She tells us that not long ago she brought several dozen shoes that she placed on credit, and her customers were buying them for various occasions such as school functions and for the holidays.  During this season, her business has been very profitable given that she can double her investment on each pair of shoes.  For this reason, she is now collecting for the shoes she has delivered as well as taking new orders so she can make her next trip.  When the meetings of her cooperative bank take place on weekends, she likes to attend every one.  When they are on workdays, however, she sends a replacement who delivers her loan installment payments.  The funds she is requesting are to pay for a shoe order that she placed on credit, and from which she has yet to make any earnings.  When she has the necessary amount, she will return for more merchandise from the city of Trujillo.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":258601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for her latest shoe order.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-20T14:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sibia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":254.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423661},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":254.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116930},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":254.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011851},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:11Z","rounded_local_amount":509.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595445},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":254.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210812},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":254.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640432},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":254.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080103}],"funded_date":"2009-01-20T15:10:53Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":88782,"name":"Tran Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb C\u00fac n\u0103m nay 45 tu\u1ed5i,  ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb kh\u00f4ng may m\u1ea5t s\u1edbm, hi\u1ec7n ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng 3 con  t\u1ea1i huy\u1ec7n Kim \u0110\u1ed9ng t\u1ec9nh H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean.

She is a wife and mother of two children. Currently both the children are in school. She loves selling goods, the business through which she obtains her source of livelihood.  She has been supplying and retailing tiger nuts (edible tubers) for five years to support her family. <P>\r\n\r\nTiger nuts have medicinal properties used in preparing local medicines for treating minor ailments. People also enjoy eating them for their good flavor. Veronica treks to Dambai in the northern part of Ghana to buy her stock of tiger nuts from farmers.

To make a living, Teresita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional business capital. Teresita is requesting a new loan which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Teresita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and supplement her income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Desde hace 4 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de alimentos en la peque\u00f1a tienda que instal\u00f3 en su casa para poder solventar los gastos de su familia. Pues este negocio result\u00f3 mucho m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo y eficaz, ya que paralelamente puede realizar las labores de su hogar; felizmente cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo y de sus hijos para atender la tienda en su ausencia. Abastecerse de nueva mercader\u00eda es lo que le resulta cansado, pues es muy complicado llegar desde el mercado hasta la zona donde vive.

Felicia says that she really enjoys working and loves the loans she has received from Esperanza, saying that if there is anything available to help her business, she would want it.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly with the work ethic she brings to the table, this is Felicia\u2019s ninth loan overall with Esperanza International.

She lives in a rented house with her 40-year-old husband, Abel, who works alongside her cultivating their land, and their two daughters: 18-year-old Yanilin and 16-year-old Yasmin.

Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elizabeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She hopes that her children will successfully complete their schooling and become able in the future to help her lead a better life.\r\n\r\nShe will continue to request loans from Turame because their terms for loans and repayments are easier to handle than with other financial institutions.

To make a living, Fedelina owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.

Fedelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Fedelina is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Fedelina from ASKI.

The mother of two, she left Inhambane to go live in Maputo with an aunt, in order to continue her studies. Her schooling was interrupted when she was in 7th Grade, due to financial constraints. She lives in a house she owns with her children and brothers, whom she supports. For the past four years she has been working at an agricultural factory, currently earning a monthly salary of 1.690.00mt, which allows her to take care of household expenses as well as save some money in the bank. Dorfina has never requested loans from other banks. She found out about Hluvuku through friends who are clients of the institution. This is her third loan and she plans to use the money to buy construction material (cement, iron, stones, beams, sand, zinc plates, etc) to continue the construction work on her house. She's confident in her ability to pay back the loan and plans to apply for more loans in the future, to finish the house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":613917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She sells the cocoa and coffee in the center of Acopio and at the market in her community, which is why her profit margin is growing. In the future she would like to have her own grocery store, because she would like to diversify her client base. This is her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and she promises to pay it back on time. Ana\u00eds brings a lot of stability to her community bank by having really good ideas. With the loan she is requesting, she will hire farmhands to help with the pruning of her cocoa fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":830547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire farmhands.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-05T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anais ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2053.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385442}],"funded_date":"2011-08-05T20:52:23Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":327285,"name":"Jarkynai's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jarkynai, 19, is the leader of this group.

She has only one little plot of land to raise her vegetables, and it's rented and costs about US$27\/month. With her little business in the market she can make perhaps US$10\/day. Maria will use this loan for seed, fertilizer, and pesticides for her crop. She has four children, all of school age, and all in school. She's married, and her husband works in the fields for others. She didn't go to school, but she reads a little and can sign her own name on documents, instead of using the very common technique of signing with a thumb print.  Maria's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles the area and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and

Her husband's income is used to pay for her children's education.  Recently the cost of the goods she buys at the market have gone up and the original funding she used is not enough to cover costs.

She owns a small shop that she obtained after much effort six months ago. Since then, she has dedicated all of her time to this business.

Renato is the 5th child of twelve siblings and he is taking care of his mother.\r\n\r\nTo support his parents and prepare for his future, Renato engaged in a pig-fattening business, and he has two productive sows today. All the piglets of the two sows were sold and the income he obtained was used to buy additional pig feed and even vitamins for the sows. It was also used to help support his family expenses, and most especially his mother.\r\n\r\nRenato found out that he needed additional capital to expand his business and to support the needs of his business. In 2004 he became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon and was able to obtain a loan for his business needs. His business improved because of the loan and he was able to add more piglets to raise and sell. And, as the amount he could borrow increased because of his good credit record, he was able to improve his business facilities and was able to earn PHP 4,000 per month, which was enough to sustain his business, support himself and his mother, and set aside some amount for his future family.\r\n\r\nFor his previous loan, Renato borrowed Php 14,000 which he used as additional working capital for his business. The said loan amount was repaid in weekly installments and was fully repaid on time and without any delays. That\u2019s why he is planning for his 10th loan to borrow the same amount. It will be used to purchase additional livestock to raise and to sell and whatever income arises from it will be used to improve and expand his business even further.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

La Suiza de Turrialba, a region in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. She has a business selling various products such as clothing, jewelry and cosmetics by going door-to-door in her community as well as at her university: Universidad de Florencio Castillos.\r\n\r\nThis will be Jessica\u2019s 3rd loan with Fundacion Mujer. Her 2nd was for 200,000 colons and was paid back on time and in full. She is happy to be applying for a larger amount (500,000 colons) than she has in the past.\r\n\r\nJessica\u2019s clients have been requesting a more diverse range of products such as hand creams and other items she currently does not offer. This loan will be used to satisfy those demands. Specifically, Jessica will use this loan to build up her inventory levels by purchasing larger quantities of products from her suppliers in San Jose. Jessica is confident that a larger volume in purchases will guarantee her a lower price and allow for higher profit margins.\r\n\r\nJessica says that her lack of working capital is her main limitation. Testaments to her acute business sense are her ability to triple her client base since she opened her business in 2007 and her success in implementing and enforcing a policy for her credit clients (people who buy clothes on credit) of no more than 60 days of credit.\r\n\r\nPrior to enrollment in university and starting her own business, Jessica worked as a receptionist for two years. She says \u201cI enjoyed my job, but I didn\u2019t see myself there permanently.\u201d She started her business in order to earn a supplemental income with an initial investment of 100,000 colons from her first loan with Fundacion Mujer. With her business, in a good month she can earn 400,000 colons, in a bad month only 200,000.\r\n\r\nWhen she isn\u2019t making sales or taking care of her children, Jessica attends classes in the afternoons and at night. The income she generates from sales is the only source of family income other than 80,000 colons per month she receives from the father of one of her sons.\r\n\r\nJessica\u2019s dream job would be to become either a radiologist or a family lawyer. However, she has decided to study special education, to be able to teach children with mental and physical disabilities. She is in her first term of a four-year program and has decided to become a teacher because it will allow her spend more time with her children.\r\n\r\nJessica\u2019s goals are to provide a better quality of living for her children. It is important to her that she raise her sons to have strong principles.\r\n\r\nJessica is an accomplished, determined and competent entrepreneur shown by her ability to build a house, attend university and take care of her two children. Since opening her business, her client base has grown significantly, a demonstration of her ability to effectively use past loans to strengthen her business. In order to balance her numerous demanding daily responsibilities, Jessica has become adept at time management. When her children are sleeping, Jessica studies or cleans the house; in the afternoons, she makes sales in the community; in the evenings, she attends night classes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":465014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately $62 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Blenda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nBlenda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She sells these items to business connections and gains a considerable amount of profit. The business has no official commercial space of its own \u2014 at least yet. She has been running this business for four years without the help of employees. Every month she earns a net income of Php6, 820.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is applying for a loan of Php9, 000 to purchase more stock for her business, such as shoes and apparel. She also plans to start selling electronic loads for mobile phones across various network service providers. The profits from this business will be used in the future to invest in a house for rent.\r\n\r\nOne challenge for Elsa is inventory control. She finds it hard to make an accurate couint of her goods; she also lacks time for her family, which is very crucial. But she realizes that proper management of what she has \u2014 time and resources \u2014 is the solution to the problem.

And a far-reaching dream would be to buy a piece of her own land, which would cost the nearly unthinkable sum of US$1000 or more. Berta, 51, speaks mostly her native Quich\u00e9, but also speaks a good bit of Spanish, which she learned out of necessity in her work life. She didn't go to school as a girl and does not read or write. Cultivating crops is all she knows, but at least now she can work the fields at least a little bit for her own account, instead of working all the time for others.\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nWomen's group:

lives in a rented place. There are about 50 rooms, very crowded. There is an inside bathroom, kitchen, a bedroom and a living room. The living room is also his place of business. Usually the customers come to Pak (Mr.) Supri (nickname) asking for jacket to be sewn. The cost to sew a jacket is between Rp50,000.00-70,000.00 (US$ 5.50-7.70) depending on difficulty. if orders are slow, Pak Supri would also takes orders from an artshop in Ktua. For transportation Pak Supri uses his motor cycle to pick up and delivers the orders. Supriadi lives with his wife and two son and daughter. His son is in 9th grade (3rd class middle school), and his daughter in 1st grade. His wife used to work in a Taylor shop, but has to give up to bring and pick up the children to school. However she is helping him with sewing too. The capital that would be received would be used to buy another sewing machine, so that the sewing process could be done faster, also completing more orders. So far Pak Supri only receive orders, with raw materials brought by the customers. However, he plans to make shirts from his own raw materials and sell it in the artshop. This will increase his business and creativity.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>Supriadi tinggal di sebuah rumah kos. Ada sekitar 50 kamar, sangat padat. Ada kamar mandi dalam, dapur, satu kamar tidur dan satu ruang tamu. Ruang tamu inilah tempat usahanya. Biasanya pelanggan sendiri yang datang ke rumah Pak Supri, minta dijahitkan jaket. Ongkos jahit satu jaket antara Rp 50.000,00 \u2013 Rp 70.000,00, tergantung tingkat kesulitannya. Kalau sepi pesanan. Pak Supri mengambil pesanan dari artshop di Kuta. Sebagai alat transportasi, Pak Supri menggunakan sepeda motor untuk mengambil dan mengantar pesanan. Supriyadi tinggal bersama isteri dan kedua putra putrinya. Putranya kelas 3 SMP dan Putrinya kelas 1 SD. Isterinya pernah kerja di Taylor, tetapi karena anaknya sekolah, dia harus mengantar dan menjemput anaknya di sekolah. Isterinya sendiri ikut membantu suaminya menjahit. Modal yang didapat akan dibelikan mesin jahit lagi. Supaya proses menjahitnya lebih cepat, pesanan yang bisa diselesaikan juga semakin banyak. Mengenai bahan baku, untuk saat ini Pak Supri hanya menerima pesanan. Jadi bahannya dibawa oleh yang memesan. Namun, dia berencana untuk bisa membuat baju dari bahan yang dia punyai sendiri untuk dijual di artshop. Hal ini tentu akan lebih membuka peluang baginya untuk lebih mengembangkan usaha dan kreatifitasnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":68646,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy a sewing machine<p>Membeli mesin jahit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-24T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Supriadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-09T00:03:18Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":125,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T06:49:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-01T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68307},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:40:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-01T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85246},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-01T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105292},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-01T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124107},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-01T07:39:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-01T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145964}],"funded_date":"2007-09-25T00:03:18Z","paid_date":"2008-03-01T07:39:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23255,"name":"Faapaia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faapaia is 27 years old and single.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Minerva G.'s Group.\r\n\r\nMinerva is from the village of Carikkikan Norte. She is 29 years old, is married, and has three school-aged children.\r\n\r\nMinerva owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Minerva joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

One of these people, Mrs. Kong S., 46, has been chosen to be the leader of this loan group by the other members. Kong S. currently works cleaning rooms for a small firm. She gets a specific salary of $70 a month to manage her family\u2019s needs. She is married with one teenage child who is still unemployed, while her husband works in construction.

She goes to central Benin, more precisely to Glazou\u00e9, one of the international markets for staple foods, in order to stock up on yam tubers.  \r\n\r\nF\u00e9licit\u00e9 is an ALID\u00e9 client who has already had two loans, which she has repaid.  Though as ever, she lacks sufficient financial means for satisfying all the demands of her customers.  For this reason, she\u2019s requesting this third loan for bolstering her working capital.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Her husband Nasir, who is 49 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are between 13 and 26 years old. Sitti Hawa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sitti Hawa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,500 to buy stocks for her store and food products so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of her business. Sitti Hawa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
