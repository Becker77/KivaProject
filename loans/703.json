Beatrice is a 53-year-old married woman with four children. She runs a kuku, or poultry, business that she started last year. Although she is a new entrepreneur, she has been making a monthly profit of approximately $US140. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. \"Kuku\" means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\nBeatrice is requesting a loan of $US275 to increase the number of chicks in her business and to purchase additional feed. With the expected increased profits, Beatrice hopes to increase the scale of her business.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

Thanks to her industry and courage in facing those trials, she started up a variety store as one of her sources of income to cope up with the basic needs of her family.   \r\n\r\nOne of her greatest dreams is to send her children to school and have them finish their studies.  She also dreams of a stable business and even of having the working capital to become a wholesaler of rice and a retailer as well.  With these dreams she needs a capital of Php 10,000 for her next loan through ASHI.  Giving a chance to have a starting capital of Php 5,000 she aims to do her best to maintain her good performance in ASHI, since this is an opportunity, according to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":231959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Building goes by season in Kenya, so Amina does not sell much during the rainy season, but is quite busy now during the dry season, as people are building homes and offices before the rains come.<P>\r\n\r\nAmina found that working on the council has not provided her with a high enough salary to support the 5 out of her 10 children who are still dependent on her. Her profits from the popsicle business go toward daily transport, meals, and daily costs, while the larger (but infrequent) sales of building materials provide money for school fees and larger purchases.<P>\r\n\r\nAmina has applied for a loan of approximately 375 USD in order to buy what will be her second freezer, flavor and sugar packets, food coloring, and ice cream powder, as well as building materials. Amina says that she is two years away from retirement from the council, but cannot leave her businesses until her children are older. She has 1 child in university, 2 in college, 1 in form 3, and 1 in standard 7. They all attend private schools and the fees are high. Amina would like to expand from selling building materials into building houses with those materials and selling them. She is currently working to save funds in order to advance with this plan.

Due to financial difficulties, his studies were interrupted at the end of high-school. At age 20 Osvaldo moved from the Matola to the Boane district, where he still lives. He has been working as a driver-mechanic for 7 years. Working Mon-Fri, from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm, his monthly salary is 8000,00 mt, which allows him to save some money--he currently lives in a house lent by his uncle. This is his first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He learned about Hluvuku though a friend, who is already a client. Osvaldo plans to pay his first loan back quickly, so he can apply for another one, to finish building his house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

She has a fixed amount she sells every week, but would like to have more products to sell so she can increase her margin of income.  For this reason, she needs a loan in order to buy merchandise at wholesale.  The small quantities she buys now are not enough to allow her to buy at wholesale, so she is paying higher prices for her goods.

She has a business where she engages in three economic activities:  a sewing workshop, a variety store, and a beauty salon.  Luz is separated from her husband and has custody of her children because their father left the country.  Therefore she must work with great effort in order to get ahead.  She learned how to sew and style hair, skills that enable her to make a living and fight vigorously to support her children.\r\n<p>\r\nSince first entering the solidarity group program, Luz has received eleven loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She now receives individual loans.  Her participation in the organization has made a difference in her life because she has received business and personal advice in addition to taking out loans.  At the moment, she is requesting a loan of 1,500,000 COP to purchase school supplies, stationery, lingerie, accessories for making first communion dresses, linens, and shoes.   \r\n<p>\r\nThroughout the year, she has contracts with schools in the city to rent out first communion dresses since she manufactures all kinds of clothing and sportswear.  Through this activity she gives poor people the opportunity to wear clothing for special occasions at a very low cost.

S. is 31 years old and lives with her husband and their 3 children, ages 1,3, and 7 years.  They live in the Las Nieves neighborhood, one of the most traditional and heavily populated areas in the southeast part of Barranquilla.  They live in her parent's home, where they also have their business.  On her side, in a heated glass display case, she sells food and fried food such as soups, cold cuts, sausages, pork rinds, and rennet on a weekly basis, and on a daily basis she sells sweets and fruits, including sweets made of chocolate, marshmallow, coconut, and fruits such as mango, corozo, pears, and papaya.  On the other side her husband works selling fish, shrimp and other seafood.  This is their second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n and they request an amount of 2,000,000 Colombian pesos that they want to invest in the purchase of a light vehicle to transport passengers.  Her husband will drive this vehicle, and they will also use it to offer their food products for sale, because Yenni wants to have a daily income that is more reliable.  This is a medium that is often used for transportation over short distances and to other nearby neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nShe learned to sell watching her mother from the time she was a child.  Now she has this same business, which was left to Yenni 7 years ago.  Her previous loan was used to restock her store and to pay off other debts that were charging a high rate of interest.  Her dream and current challenge is to have her own house and to see her children grow and become educated for a better future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Fernando B., a technician, and is mother to a young working adult and a simple stay-at-home who manages the household while she attends to her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a photocopying business. There is more need now than before for services like these as customers\u2019 demands increase. Her main patrons are students, who require her services for school requirements. She also has people who need her photocopier for documents, form replication and other similar needs. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in profit every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy a second hand Xerox machine, bond paper, toners, ink, and other supplies for her business. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy spare parts and repair fees for the photocopying machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nTeresita dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is married and is responsible for four people consisting of his wife and three children. Very dynamic, serious and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his herd and repair his enclosure, so as to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, who buy animals from within 20 km of his village. With this goal in mind, Abduvahob is requesting a loan that will serve him as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments.   \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Homirzoev lives in Shahrinav region of Tajikistan. He is 32 years old, married and has 2 children. \r\nTo provide for his family Bahodur has been managing his own business for the last 6 years. He owns a cafe where he makes kebobs and bakes sambusas (fried pastry with meat filling). Recently the prices for flour have been rising and Bahodur wants to buy a large batch of flour so that he can keep his food prices low despite the rising flour costs. This will help him keep his regular customers and attract new ones. But he needs money to be able to purchase such a large batch of flour. That is why Bahodur has planned to take out a loan of 450 dollars which he wants to pay back in the next 9 months.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva

from Tanzania!  Mary is a 40-year-old married woman with three children. She owns and operates a beauty salon that she just established four months ago. By working 13 hours a day for six days every week, she is already showing a monthly profit of $US200 from the salon! Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. \r\n<p>Mary is requesting a loan $US275 to buy additional supplies such as hair dryers and other hair products for her store, which will allow her to serve more customers and generate additional income.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-02T15:39:42Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:09:58Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345767},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":31266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347925},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970499},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886716},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435976},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130276},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027107},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613147},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010230},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232541}],"funded_date":"2008-08-19T15:39:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64740,"name":"Khady","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"KHADY B. est une femme commer\u00e7ante n\u00e9e le 05\/01\/1956 \u00e0 bambey .elle vit avec son mari et ses enfants au quarier leona de bambey .depuis presque huit ans elle vend au d\u00e9tail de l'encens qu'elle m\u00e9lange elle meme de fa\u00e7on artisanale.c'est dans le but de renforcer son stock de matieres premieres qu'elle sollicite ce pret afin de satisfaire sa client\u00e8le pendant l'hivernage.","en":"Khady B. is a saleswoman born on January 5, 1956 in Bambey.

This is 22-year-old Rusia J. from Kyela. She is married with one child, age 8. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents died of HIV.  Rusia has been running a cocoa business since 2008. She buys cocoa from farmers and sells them in town for a higher price. She works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Rusia currently earns about 120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more cocoa in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Rusia thanks you for your support!\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more cocoa in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rusia M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rosalia\u2019s frituria is very popular, and the locals are always quick to grab a treat from her.\r\n\r\nRosalia lives in a neighborhood without many utilities. Living in a small town in the Dominican Republic can mean frequent power outages (if you have power to begin with), no plumbing, and insufficient shelter from the elements.

She lives with her 38 year old husband, Eladio, and their two children, Elena, age 13, and Ever, age 7, in their own home. She is a fighter and although she only could finish primary school, she is prepared to work very hard to give her children a good education. Despite the climatic variations, Lidia leaves very early with her husband to obtain milk that the livestock farmers milked. She then prepares cheeses which are sold afterward in the Juliaca and Huancane markets. Lidia enjoys a lot about her work.  From doing this activity for over 10 years, she believes that the hardest part is obtaining the amount of milk needed to prepare the 30 cheeses that she produces daily.  What Lidia longs for the most is to have a very large store in the city Juliaca where she could sell her delicious cheeses with more ease. This is her first loan with MFP and she hopes not to miss payments of her fees. She also already feels committed to her other companions from her village bank.

The buds will serve as seeds to continue propagation on other parcels of land.  \r\n\r\nShe will devote herself to selling the seeds from the cacao grafts.  She will do this because most of her neighbors are starting to plant more cacao, but they lack the grafts that guarantee a good production as a result.

She also grows organic coffee and produces regular cacao.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with the work she does because it has pleased her ever since she was very little.

Haja requires a loan in order to buy cartons of enamel pans and hot warmers. In the past plans, Haja was looking forward to building a house in a long term plan, considering the economic trend of the country; but now she wants to concentrate on the business. Haja's previous aim of acquiring a much larger business place was not successful but the business did well, therefore she bought some household assets.

 E. is married to Grace Numfor and they are blessed with 4 children above 15 years of age. E. and his entire family are living in a house with 3 bedrooms and one sitting room. As a very hard working man, Abam has faced many challenges in life such as the death of his mother and father in the same year and a robbery costing him huge sums of money and destruction of materials. The latter problem made life very difficult for him because he was sponsoring two children in the university at the time. In  the year 2006, Abam saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.\r\n\t\r\nAbam plans to buy cows with his loan. Repayment of the loan will start at  the fourth month from the day of disbursement He is convinced that the business will succeed because of the experience he had have in it and he is well known in the community. He is going to provide the community with meat, skin material for the manufacture of other commodities. Not forgetting the trust those in his community have for him.\r\n\t\r\nAbam plans to use the profit from the loan and that of previous loans to, pay for his children school fees, feed and cloth his family. With all these, he will enjoy a better and comfortable life. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because it offers trainings before giving out loans, proper follow up is done after the loan is disbursed to ensure proper usage of the loan, and the method of repayment is convenient and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Baod, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  blacksmith shop and buying and selling of ready to wear clothes. Her husband, Marcelino M., who is 57 years old, works as a blacksmith in their shop to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 11 children who are between 15 and 32 years old.\r\n\r\nMary Jane joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Jane has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future house repair and support for the education of her grandchildren. Mary Jane M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own home with her husband Alfredo and their two beloved children, Nancy (age 10) and Alfredo (age 7), from whom she provides all of her support.  Ever since she was a young girl, Bertha was encouraged to work in the fields along with her siblings.  Her parents taught her everything she needed to know to produce a good crop.  Now she has her own land that she looks after with great love and patience.  Bertha knows that the quality of her output depends on the amount of care that she provides.  She plants cacao and coffee and then sells her harvest to different collection centers in the cities of Santa Rosa and San Francisco.  What she enjoys most about her work is harvesting her crops because she feels all of her hard work has come to fruition.  Bertha has been farming for 23 years and considers the most difficult part to be protecting her crops from swarms of insects that could impact her harvest.  Her greatest wish is to buy additional land so that she can increase her production.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with MFP.  Bertha was very prompt in repaying the money and hopes that the assistance from Kiva lenders will help her continue making progress.  In her Communal Bank, she is very supportive of the other members.  The money she requested will be used to buy cacao plants to fill her plot of land.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":871003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cacao plants.

She\u2019s been a merchant for over 20 years and has worked just with her children for the last 11 years.  She learned how to run the business well thanks to training from her husband.  Because he was a cattle merchant he started bringing her a bag of snacks or an arroba of sugar and gradually she started to make progress until her business became strong.\r\n\r\nMercedes has to travel to the city to make her purchases.  She boards a bus that takes her on a trip that takes three hours.  She returns home in a mototaxi (a motorcycle that provides taxi services).  When Mercedes makes larger purchases she travels to a more distant city and takes seven hours to do her shopping and return home.  On these occasions she avails herself of a truck that leaves once a week and transports all the merchants from her community.\r\n\r\nShe requests a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to improve her store.  Mercedes previously sold on credit to her customers, a common practice in her community, but they delayed paying her which decreased Mercedes\u2019 buying capacity.    The loan will make it possible for her to buy larger amounts of merchandise to meet customer demand thus improving her income.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mercedes intends to continue improving her business to always have what\u2019s necessary to survive and not be dependent on others.  Besides, Mercedes wants to leave a legacy for her children and grandchildren: that they know how to earn their livelihood honestly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":890481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-10-10T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":40.29},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":43.94},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.94},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.72,"local_amount":61.72,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":61.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238807076},{"amount":37.07,"local_amount":37.07,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":37.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773836},{"amount":39.04,"local_amount":39.04,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:20Z","rounded_local_amount":39.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182418},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":40.87,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":40.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317374},{"amount":42.15,"local_amount":42.15,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":42.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033056},{"amount":279.15,"local_amount":279.15,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":279.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645277}],"funded_date":"2011-10-30T22:36:23Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":348363,"name":"Soledad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Soledad es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cBellavista\u201d ubicado en el distrito de Puno, provincia y departamento de Puno, tiene 19 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera y no tiene hijos, cuenta con estudios universitarios.\nLa se\u00f1orita se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de pan, trabaja con el Movimiento Manuela Ramos desde hace un a\u00f1o.

The family's source of income is from carenderia (small restaurant) while her husband is also a photographer and videographer. Nilda's carenderia started in January of 2006 with a profit of 800.00 pesos. At that time, they could not afford to provide the menu they desired. The family values their carenderia and tries to maintain a quality service. They manage to survive even when there is strong competition. They increased the number of options on the menu to give the customers more choices and as a result, private and public employees, students, and other commuters started dropping in. Paglaum has been a constant financing partner. They applied for an additional loan for her existing carenderia and to venture into a new field: barbecue selling. Their business allows them to purchase more stocks of drinks and meat for her business. She dreamed that someday her business can be seen not only in Ozamiz city, but also in other places in Misamis Occidental.Their greatest desire is for all their children to finishschool and to have a job for a better

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 30 years old, married, and has 4 children (ages 14, 12, 8, and 5).  All of them attend school in the community and are in different graD. levels.\r\n<p>\r\nFor 5 years, Maricela has managed a business selling groceries and basic necessities.  Her shop has always been small because she never received the assistance of a loan.  Four months ago, she obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad in the amount of 3000 MXN and used it to expand her store a little bit.  That loan has been repaid.  Today she will receive a second loan of 5000 MXN so that she can continue to develop her business.  The income from her store covers her family\u2019s expenses, while her husband\u2019s earnings are used to pay for their children\u2019s education.  He is employed at a soft drink company, but his salary is not enough to pay for all of the household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to access a loan, the group had to consist of 10 women from the same community.  Each member must engage in a productive business activity, since this is a prerequisite for receiving a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  With no previous credit experience, these ladies are pleased with the benefits they have received.  They hope to continue in their development because they want to be eligible for future business loans.  In addition, they are happy to be working with one another and hope they can continue as a group.    \r\n<p>\r\nThe breakdown of the group loan is as follows:\r\nMaricela Zu\u00f1iga A. requests 5000 MXN to sell food. \r\nDolores M. B. requests 3000 MXN to sell food.\r\nLucia A. R. requests 2000 MXN to sell food.\r\nAdalberta R. M. requests 1000 MXN to sell food.\r\nAgripina R. R. requests 8000 MXN to sell food.\r\nDioema Cris\u00f3stomo C. requests 8000 MXN to sell natural products.\r\nPaula Y. L. requests 6000 MXN to sell food.\r\nPetra D. Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez requests 8000 MXN to sell food.\r\nIsabel G. M. requests 2000 MXN to sell regional bananas.\r\nRoberta G.

He says that his neighborhood is relatively safe with very cooperative neighbors.  He is married and has a 28 year old son. He has a business in his home where he sells merchandise, espcecially clothing and shoes. He does this with his wife and it is why he is asking for a loan of $1.600.000, to buy the described merchandise.\r\n\r\nGilberto used to work with furniture and products for the home. He also worked as a messenger for 17 years until 1997, when he stopped because the business went broke. When he received his severance, he began to travel to Magangue, a town in the department of Bol\u00edvar on the shores of the  Magdalena river, the most important river in Colombia.  Gilberto would bring fish from Magangue which he would sell. His wife also would make and sell bolis, a type of Colombian ice cream. She sells it now in the Estadio Metropolitano when there are soccer games. In addition to selling the bolis, both of them sell ice cream, candy and merchandise such as clothes, shoes and acccesories from the house.  \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan and he invested the last one in improving the selection of merchandise in his business. In the future, he dreams of having a bigger business in a good location. Setting it up is also his biggest challenge since money is required. Additionally, his goal is to establish a workshop for his son, who is taking classes in automotive technology and vehicular gas technology in the SENA, a national organization that encourages learning. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She earns her living by selling vegetables. Her husband Freddie, who is 44 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have five children who are between 8 and 21 years old. Gemma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy more vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education & household improvements. Gemma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His activity has been very satisfying since he can now take care of his family, pay school tuition for his children, and save enough money toward future plans, such as opening a large shoe shop.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":941180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy shoes and sandals for children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":38400},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":39300},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40200},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":41100},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":42100},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":44000},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45000},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45900},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":46800},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":36700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.72},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.3},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.94},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":230.83,"local_amount":112600,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113700.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257219070},{"amount":162.97,"local_amount":79500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80277.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357100},{"amount":170.56,"local_amount":83200,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84013.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270070435},{"amount":178.35,"local_amount":87000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":87850.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276685166},{"amount":282.29,"local_amount":137700,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":139046.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283173107}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T00:04:21Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:08:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":372970,"name":"Anyar Sari 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Like many Balinese women, Ni Wayan and the other members of the Anyar Sari 2 group raise pigs in their yards to supplement their families\u2019 incomes.

If the credit isn't enough to meet her objective, she hopes to continue working with AFODENIC until she fulfills her dream of having her own home with all of the conditions that every human being needs to feel well.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

N. is 25 years old, married and has a 6-year-old son who recently began elementary school.  His wife works as a seamstress.  His intentions are to increase his business in order to earn a better income so that he will not have the same economic problems that he has today.  His wishes are to establish his business as a street vendor and also to establish a business for his wife so that both can work and earn a modest living.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Wilfredo\u2019s family dreams of a better quality of life; he wants to improve his property, which with much effort he bought.  Mr. Wilfredo wants to remodel his property so that his son can have a decent and adequate place to live.  He also desires to give his son all that he will need for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Wilfredo sells merchandise such as: chairs, handbags, shoes and clothing.  He has run his traveling business for 3 years.  He began his business through a friend who acted as the manager.  In the beginning Mr. Wilfredo relied on the little experience he had obtained from his mother to start his business.  He lovingly grew his business little by little and began offering small things such as:  sheets, towels and decorative pictures.  While attempting to sell his products to his customers he was a little timid at first which cost him business and it was not easy to commit to this type of job.  He fought to remain a business owner in order to maintain the livelihood of his family.  Mr. Wilfredo will use the loan to obtain merchandise at a favorable price and sell it to his customers.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Breanne Kochert, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":259907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-22T22:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo Danilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":857.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":857.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:37Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400001},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091999},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985382},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445998},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956639},{"amount":46.44,"local_amount":857.14,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:28Z","rounded_local_amount":915.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174064},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":857.16,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:33Z","rounded_local_amount":915.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599690}],"funded_date":"2009-01-22T23:43:24Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Breanne Kochert","image":398211}},{"id":89378,"name":"Uchumi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amina has been a clothes seller in the Sakina neighborhood of Arusha for 9 years.

village, in Kandal province.  They plan to use the loan for different purposes. \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Tom S. is the 50 year old Village Bank president.  She is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice to earn a living.  Her husband, Mr. Hae Sat, is a construction worker.  Although they try to work hard, they still earn less income than needed to support their household.  In order to improve their living, she decided to ask for a loan to purchase a sewing machine to start a new business to earn more income.  She has two children who are enrolled in the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nFour members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.  They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.  \r\n<p>\r\nMost clients start to make payments many months before the end of their loan terms.  Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.  AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":293669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

adults. She and her family live in Brgy. Abuanan, Bago City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nOfelia is starting a new business venture - to sell rice products in her local community. For this undertaking, Ofelia needs PHP 15,000.00 as additional capital. She projects that this new business will earn her an additional PHP 2,000 per month, which she plans to use to pay for the tuition fees of her children who are still going to school.\r\n\r\nOfelia has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and she has always paid her previous loans, even when things got rough. She admits that starting a new business in not easy but for her, the future of her children is more important than any hardship or struggle that she might encounter along the way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Every day he goes to his fields with his small crew of helpers because he doesn't have any relatives to help him with his farming.  He has cared for his potato and pea crops for 6 years because he likes to have the economic benefits that his hard work produces as a reward.  Meanwhile, his mother feeds and cares for the sheep and pigs she raises.  The profits they get allow them to meet their household expenses comfortably and care-free, they even are able to set aside a little so that they can buy small farm animals, like rabbits and guinea pigs, later on.  He also wants to sell tubers as seed or for consumption and to extend his productivity.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he is already saving up money to make his repayments on time, as do his other communal bank members, because they have always been noted for being very responsible.  \r\n\r\nIn order to get a better crop yield, Eduardo needs to buy manure, fertilizers and a different variety of pea seeds for which he is asking for 500 new soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":487926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure, fertilizer and pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T20:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672927}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T21:13:48Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":180169,"name":"Thelma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thelma M. is from the village of Carangan, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental.

She lives in her own house and takes care of her parents, who live in Marracuene, by sending them 800 meticais' worth of food and household goods every month.\r\n\t\r\nElmina was invited by her aunt to come live in Namaacha, which is on the border with Swaziland.  After her arrival, she continued with her studies, and when she was in sixth grade she became pregnant.  Some years later, she began to work in mukero (sale of contraband goods) on the Swaziland border, but because the work was very hard, she decided to begin selling basic goods from her home.  With her savings she built a small store in her home.  Her best products are rice and sugar, which she buys by the sack for 850 meticais per four sacks and 1800 meticais per two sacks, respectively.  She sells them for 1,250 meticais per four sacks and 2,050 meticais per two sacks.  Elmina manages to save 1,000 meticais per month.  She counts on the help of her husband, who works in government as the neighborhood Secretary.\r\n\r\nThis is Elmina's third loan with Hluvuku-Adsema and Kiva.  The others were for 10,000 meticais each, and were used to purchase products (rice, beans, sugar and other items) to increase the inventory of her store.  She is confident that she will pay back the loan ahead of schedule.  In the future, she intends to apply for more loans and build a large store to meet her customers' needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva
