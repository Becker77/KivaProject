end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 30 year old Salma R. N. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with three children, between the ages of 6 and 10.\r\n<p>\r\nSalma has been running a charcoal-selling and a fish-selling business since 2004. She sells charcoal, which is used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative! Salma works at the business for 13-16 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two people. Salma currently earns about 250 USD from her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSalma is requesting a loan in order to purchase stock in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to establish a new business. Salma thanks you for your support!\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b><br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":304660,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

At four every afternoon she takes her grill and starts selling pieces of chicken and beef heart.  She cooks them on the grill at the bus stop.  Time has allowed her to win various customers, mostly the workers of the bus lines at the stop.  They eat her food because they know it tastes good and for the prices.\r\n\r\nWhat she does not like about her work is that there is plenty of competition selling food in the area.  Therefore, she needs to take great care in the good presentation and the prices of the grilled food.  As she is a woman who always plans for the future, she plans to establish a restaurant where she would offer all types of dishes.  This is the way she hopes to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments on time.  She does not want to disappoint the people who made this loan possible.  The loan allows her to continue working as she seeks to make progress.  Adela plans to use the requested loan to buy wholesale ingredients that she needs to prepare her dishes.  She wants to increase her earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":684309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy wholesale ingredients to continue making food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T15:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":257.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887120},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":257.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327481},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":257.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196027},{"amount":93.48,"local_amount":254.95,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":262.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269712},{"amount":98.83,"local_amount":269.55,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":277.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549715},{"amount":82.69,"local_amount":225.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":231.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718408}],"funded_date":"2011-01-06T16:53:16Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":266911,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marina tiene 37 a\u00f1os, vive al lado de sus 2 hijas en una casa arrendada.

This is 43 year old Matilda A. N.. She is a married mother of three children who are between the ages of 6 and 18. She also supports two dependents who attend school near her house. Matilda is a Tanzanian entrepreneur who has been running a poultry business since 2007. In Tanzania it is called a \u201cKuku\u201d business, as kuku means chicken in Swahili. Kuku is a favorite among Tanzanians and they make finger-licking good fried chicken here!\r\n\r\nHer business is simple, however tedious. She buys chicks, tends to them for five weeks, and then sells them in the market. But as you can see from her photo, tending to chickens is back breaking work!\r\n\r\nHer business is doing well and she is able to make an average monthly profit of about US$100. Matilda is requesting a loan in order to buy additional chicks and feed. She thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":248275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Responsible Ladies Communal Bank is comprised of a group of capable and strong-willed women who make supporting their families a high priority. Despite the obstacles that surface on a daily basis, they have been able to form an excellent working team that looks out for the welfare of its members. The Communal Bank is located in the city of Cuenca, which lies in a mountainous region of southern Ecuador.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Blanca I. is a member of the Responsible Ladies Communal Bank.  She lives in the neighborhood of Visorey in central Cuenca.  She is 63 years old, married, and the mother of 6 children ranging in age from 28 to 44.  All of her children are grown and live independently.  Blanca and her husband are raising a grandson who was abandoned at birth.  Her husband is 67 years old and has been working at his carpentry workshop for 20 years.  This business has provided for their daily needs and enabled them to build a house, although it is still unfinished.\r\n<p>\r\nBlanca assists her husband in his workshop and also performs the household chores.  Since she suffers from high blood pressure and kidney disease, she is not able to overextend herself and lead a normal life.  She is also concerned about her business because orders have declined significantly because customers are finding alternatives to wood that are less expensive.\r\n<p>\r\nFor six years, Blanca has been working with her Communal Bank.  She invested her loans into her business and her home.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will buy wood for making beds, cupboards, and other pieces so that she will have inventory for her business. \r\n<p>\r\nBlanca\u2019s biggest dream is to continue and grow her business since this is her family\u2019s livelihood. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":424090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase wood for making furniture pieces","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T08:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.7,"local_amount":183.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":183.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789452},{"amount":91.31,"local_amount":91.31,"processed_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":91.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679922},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679923},{"amount":274.99,"local_amount":274.99,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":274.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074473},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":183.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910472},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":0.03,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:14Z","rounded_local_amount":0.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946084},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946085},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946086},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674478}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T05:09:00Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":155625,"name":"Daylinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daylinda B. is from the village of Northern Pob., Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

This was his main inspiration when stopped selling fruit and started his current business in the 20 de Julio square, in Barranquilla. He has been selling sportswear such as jerseys, pants, socks, accessories, key chains and flags since 2000 and, for him, this has been more profitable than his previous business in that market. \r\n\r\nLuis's business is located just outside one of Colombia's most important sports arena, the Metropolitano Stadium. He is the pioneer in his activity and works along with his wife (pictured by his side) for more than 12 hours a day, from Monday to Sunday. His clients are pedestrians, people referred to him and soccer fans, including from other stadiums in the country. He has a strong competition but he is able to stand out for being innovative, having good prices and diversifying the inventory he offers. \r\n\r\nHe is currently asking for a loan in the amount of $1.300.000 to buy sports articles wholesale and in cash, especially the ones he offers such as souvenirs, jerseys of different teams, flags and accessories. \r\n\r\nHis loans with the bank have always been aimed to increase the variety of his inventory. He has also at times used them to eliminate expensive debt with loan sharks. His main goal is to transition from being a street vendor to being a registered business owner and convert his business into wholesale. These are precisely his challenges.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":513713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy sports articles wholesale and in cash, especially souvenirs, jerseys of different teams, flags and accessories","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144698},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":154032},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":157241},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":160517},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":163861},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167275},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":170760},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":181616}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.08},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.86},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.13,"local_amount":144698,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":145056.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712303},{"amount":161.62,"local_amount":311273,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":312044.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895804},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":160517,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":160914.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850226},{"amount":171.94,"local_amount":331136,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":331956.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172116991},{"amount":182.96,"local_amount":352376,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":353249.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550516}],"funded_date":"2010-04-09T22:19:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias","image":null}},{"id":193173,"name":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Manuel De Jes\u00fas tiene la actividad econ\u00f3mica es una pulper\u00eda.

She is married and has 3 school-age children.  They live together in the Sirenachayocc community, in the beautiful Cuzque\u00f1a jungle.  They own their own home, which is made of wood.  Marisa thinks strategically:  her primary goal was to produce a high-quality product because potential buyers would pay more for high-quality and of course she would be able to sell her products quickly.  Secondly, she wanted to be in a competitive market, and, achieving this, she is now with other potential sellers.  In the future, she wishes to greatly expand her cultivated land in order to produce on a large scale.  She recognizes that she must work hard in her cocoa plantation.  Only at harvest will she need workers to transfer her product to markets in the community in order to sell it.

Her group is located in the rural area surrounding El Seibo, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity. Maria makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and four children. \r\n<br>Maria has run her business for over six years, starting with her first loan with Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying fruits and vegetables such as avocados, bananas, oranges, mangoes, etc. She is excited to be taking her 12th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She will use her profits to buy school supplies and uniform for her children, improve her business and progress. She says that her most difficult challenge is to progress in her business.

They formed this group because they are neighbors from the same place.  The group is called Los Mangos.  Its members decided to give it this name because the place that they meet together is at Fortunata\u2019s house, and there is a mango tree there that provides lovely shade and delicious mangos.  This group is located in a beautiful place where there is a river where people go to bathe, wash clothes, and fish.\r\n\r\nFortunata, age 45, represents the group.  She is happily married to 49 year old Serefino.  Fortunata is the one that invited people to be part of this group to make her business bigger and so that those that did not have a business were able to start one and change their lives.\r\n\r\nShe has two children, a girl and a boy.\r\n\r\nShe works with a mill that she has at her house.  She grinds corn and peppers to make \u201cmole\u201d (sauce).  She likes her business because it gives her good income, especially when people from her area are having a fiesta or wedding.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy new pieces for her mill.  She will buy things like the tray for the corn and new stones because the ones she has are bad.\r\n\r\nThe following are members of this group:\r\n\r\nCarmela \u2013 sells chickens.\r\nFrancisca \u2013 sells construction materials.\r\nSilvina- sells Mexican snacks.\r\nClotilde- sells chickens.\r\nRodelfina \u2013 sells \u201ctacos de guisados\u201d (tortilla filled with a variety of prepared

Her husband went to Russia for work but never returned to his home country because he married a woman in Russia. Adiba and her two minor children returned to her parents' home and six months later she divorced her husband. It was hard for Adiba to go through these difficult times.

Despite being in her sixties, her experience and energy are undeniable.  Her husband lost his ability to work which leaves Ms. G. to face paying the bills by herself.  The quality of her product has earned her a large customer base because good women come from Lom\u00e9 to buy her gari.  But without enough money, her production of gari is very limited, and her customers are increasingly disappointed.  She is now dealing with a strong demand that she cannot meet.  Making gari is difficult, given the high risk of injury, particularly when grating the cassava root by hand.  Today, she is requesting a loan of $600 to buy a grater in order to increase her production and her profit margin, all to better provide for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants, Madame G.

Every day she fed those 2 pigs 2X\/day Konsentrat (local brand) mixed with banana tree trunk at a cost of Rp15,000 (about US$1.70). She has been working on this business for 3 years, since her husband's income as a tenant farmer is not sufficient to pay for family expenses. Especially Ketut Warni has a child that now goes to Middle school. Every 4 months the mother pigs give birth to up to 10 piglets, after 2 months those piglets were ready to be sold. From that sales up to Rp 1,900,000 (about US$209) at Rp190,000X10, she could profit Rp800,000 (about $88)\/6 months. This profit is used to pay for child school expenses,  and other family needs. Ketut Warni is happy that with a loan from Dinari for Rp 1,300,000 (about $143-150 depending on exchange rate fluctuation) she could expand her business by buying another mother pig for Rp800,000 (about $88), while the rest Rp500,000 (about $55) would be used to buy animal feed.

Setiap hari  babi tersebut diberi makan  Konsentrat dicampur dengan batang pisang , sebanyak 2 kali sehari dan biaya yang dikeluarkan untuk 2 ekor babi tersebut sebanyak Rp.15.000.  Usaha ini ditekuninya semenjak 3 tahun yang lalu mengingat penghasilan suami sebagai seorang petani tidak mampu mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga . Apalagi Ketut Warni mempunyai satu orang anak yang kini sudah duduk dibangku SMU. Setiap 4 bulan sekali babi penginduk tersebut melahirkan anaknya .Dan sekarang salah satunya sudah melahirkan anak sebanyak 10 ekor, setelah 2 bulan maka anak-anak babi sudah siap dijual. Dari hasil penjualan sebanyak Rp. 1.900.000 ( @ 190.000 x 10) maka keuntungan yang diperoleh sebesar Rp.800.000 setiap enam bulan sekali. Keuntungan ini pergunakan untuk biaya sekolah anaknya juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan keluarga Ketut Warni . Sekarang Ketut warni sangat senang dengan adanya pinjaman dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.300.000 karena dengan pinjaman tersebut Ketut Warni bisa pengembangkan usahanya dengan membeli 1 ekor babi penginduk lagi seharga Rp.800.000 ,sedangkan sisanya sebesar Rp.500.000 dipergunakan untuk modal pakan ternak. Hal ini dilakukan agar hasil atau keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih banyak dan dapat mencukupi biaya hidup sehari-hari."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy mother pig and animal feed<p>Membeli induk babi dan pakan ternak","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-05T04:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Warni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-19T05:26:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T06:26:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70386},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86646},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:27:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100306},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119108},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139693},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164712}],"funded_date":"2007-10-05T05:26:26Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24355,"name":"Kemale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms. Kemale is a woman with a low income.

He is 39 and married with two children.  Arif is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market.  Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages.  He raises them with the help of his wife (see photo) in 8-9 months and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers.  Today Arif is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family.  He plans to purchase an additional 5 calves per year.  To do this, he needs to invest an additional $500 in his business.  In order to receive this amount, Arif has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, Normicro.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0413-\u043d Arif \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u0430\u0442\u043b\u044b \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0410\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044c\u0435. \u0415\u043c\u0443 39 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2-\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.

She was able to borrow 3.000.000 on her first loan, which she used as capital to buy a variety of rubber rope products (timing belts) to sell out of her home; averaging 60.000d\/day.  After seeing the success of her business, she was able to expand her business, offering products such as automobiles rims and tires.  This special inventory demands a higher capital; therefore she is requesting a larger loan amount.  The auto part business has been a success; in 2007 she was able to purchase a truck to help aid in transporting her inventory.  This time she is requesting a loan of 9.000.000d to use as principal for the new inventory.

Before her small business, she had no job and was barely able to feed her children. She started her small business with her first loan from Esperanza International, and has been slowly increasing her business. She feels like this next loan will really help her increase the business size, and start generating more income.

She works at her business 10 hours a day and 6 days per week. Her business is doing well and her monthly profits are approximately US$250.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":248300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is married with three children of school age. Sharofat is running a caf\u00e9 where she is providing meals of the national and European cuisine. The caf\u00e9 is located in the central local market which allows Sharofat to have many customers, the majority of whom are those making purchases in the market. The business has been generating a stable income during the last 12 years. Now Sharofat is planning to purchase foodstuffs like wheat, potatoes, carrots, onions, and oil  wholesale. With this purpose in mind, she is requesting 800 US Dollars for a term of 11 months. Sharofat has already been provided with two loans by IMON International and has proved herself a reliable client. Today she thanks all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.    \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This bank meets in a sector called Forest Park on the outskirts of the city.  It is composed of 20 associates, among them the lady Silvia R. for two loan cycles.  \r\n\r\nSilvia has been married for 13 years and is the mother of three children.  Her husband works in home construction and she has to be more than a housewife also.  She is dedicated to their small store where she sells convenience products, milk, meats, and more.  This business was started at the urging of her mom who gave them a place in her house for the store so they would not have to pay rent. Already they have had the business for two years and it goes very well.  With the aid that the foundation offers, she has been able to continue supplying merchandise and to grow a little bit more each day.  She tells us that she began with 300 dollars and now her investment is greater.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan she will buy rice, sugar, oil, salt, water, flour, etc. wholesale to supply her business and to offer more and better products to her clients.  Her schedule of service is every day from 7 am to 8pm, for which she leaves her home and goes to her mother's house a few blocks away to tend her business.  \r\n\r\nThe dream of Silvia is to some day have a restaurant, since she likes to prepare food.

She's married and the mother of four children ages 1 to 11 (the two older ones are in school). Her studies were interrupted in 3rd Grade due to her family's financial constraints. She lives with her husband and children in a house they own; she has never left Maputo.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaria runs a small grocery store by herself, where she sells staples, and makes about 3.700.00mt per month. With the help of her husband, who receives a monthly pension as a retiree from the Defense Ministry, she is able to regularly save some money.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution. This is her fourth loan with Hluvuku; she has never had loans from other banks or institutions before. Her previous loans with Hluvuku were in the amount of 8.000.00mt, 10.000.00mt and 12.000.00mt, all used for the same purpose. She plans to use this current loan to buy construction material (cement, sand, stone, iron, etc) to build a rental unit to improve their earnings. She's confident in her ability to pay back this loan ahead of schedule and plans to apply for other loans in the future, to hopefully build more rental units.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":626656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Every morning she begins to work on her lands because she knows that the care that she provides to her cacao, coffee, and coca leaf plants will determine the quality of the crops that she obtains.  What she likes most about her work is caring for her crops and she feels very happy when she sees them large and plentiful.  She has been in this type of work for three years and she considers the most difficult part to be bringing her crops to the city of San Francisco (located in the department of Ayacucho) where she sells them, because the sacks which she uses to bring the crops are very heavy.  In the future, she hopes to improve her crops so that she can sell them at a better price.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Floriana\u2019s third loan with MFP and she knows that she has to make her loan payments on time and is prepared to do so.

He lives in his own house with his wife Nery, who is 31, and their four dear children, to whom he would like to offer a better quality of life. The activity in which Paulino makes a living is in coffee crops, as he has three hectares of land where he plants his products. He has become one of the main producers in the area due to his technologized method of cropping. His most profitable products are pineapple and cocoa, as there is a greater demand for these in the national market. \r\n\r\nWhat he likes the most about his job is harvesting his crops and he does this diligently. He has worked for the last 15 years in this activity and he believes that the most difficult part is transporting his products from his ranch to the outlets in the city of San Francisco. \r\n\r\nAt the moment his priority is to care for his crops by weeding, fumigating and fertilizing, for which he needs to hire labourers. This will be his first loan with MFP. He is committed to paying his quotas punctually as he has done in other loans. In his communal bank he participates and is punctual to all of his arranged meetings. With the 1,500 PEN he will buy manure and fertilizers to care for his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":984352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455488}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T15:52:00Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":414684,"name":"Juanitah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanitah is 30 years old and married with 3 children.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 43-year-old Rhoda K.. She is married with four children, who are between the ages of 12 and 24 years old. In 2007, Rhoda established a clothing business. Rhoda has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now seeks another loan in order to purchase additional stocks of clothing in bulk. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nRhoda is a perfect example of why micro-finance works and why the vast majority of people in her position repay their loans. A lot of people who hear about micro-finance (or kiva.org) for the first time wonder \u201chow do you make sure people pay back their loans?\" and \"won't the borrowers just take the money?\u201d Such questions wrongfully imply that the individuals who access micro-credit (usually the \"poor\") are less trustworthy, efficient, or educated than other people. Regardless, most MFIs have due diligence procedures in place to assess client risk, as well as measures (e.g., collateral arrangements and group lending, where a  loan in default is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More importantly, there is an incentive that is built into each and every micro-loan: the borrowers are incentivized to repay their loans so that they can receive additional loans as their businesses continue to grow. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":129399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Since they married, she is in charge of preparing meals for those who work on the farm. \r\n\r\nShe gets up at 6.00am to make breakfast, then feeds the animals that she raises, including guinea pigs and rabbits. She has recently bought three little pigs, and has to be very attentive to their feeding. At 8.00am she makes the lunch meal to take out to her husband, who is preparing the fields for sowing peas. Once she has delivered the meal she returns home with grass for the guinea pigs and rabbits. During the harvest season she stays out in the fields to pick the peas and supervise the labourers. Her husband undertakes the hard and heavy work such as filling the sacks with the harvest. \r\n\r\nDelfina has worked with MFP on four consecutive loans and has always made her repayments on the designated dates.

She is originally from Haiti, but moved to the Dominican Republic with her husband in search of a better life. The Dominican Republic boasts a much higher standard of living and per capita GDP (gross domestic product) than Haiti. Even so, there is a great deal of racism toward Haitians, who tend to find themselves working at menial jobs if they are lucky enough to find work at all. Junie has been struggling to adapt to the new culture and language in Puerta Plata.\r\n\r\nJunie and her husband live with their children, Ricardo and John Pierre, who are 8 and 5 years old. The children attend a local school where they study hard to make good grades. Junie ultimately hopes to enroll her children into a university, but her income is not currently sufficient to harbor such a dream. She makes 2,000 DRP a month (about 57 USD), but thinks she will be able to significantly increase her earnings through Esperanza.\r\n\r\nJunie plans to use her loan to start a small restaurant in her home. She says that she will cook rice, beans, chicken, and beef, which are some of the staples of the Dominican diet. She will buy the raw materials from a local food vendor in her neighborhood. Ultimately, Junie would like to open a fully-fledged restaurant in a busier section of Puerta Plata. That goal is a long way off, but the determination in Junie\u2019s eyes suggests it is a definite possibility. Your contribution will help Junie make the first step to turn her aspirations into reality.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":353726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

21 mujeres que residen en el pueblo de Rocafuerte, aproximadamente media hora de la ciudad de Portoviejo. La ciudad es muy conocida por los dulces que vende. El grupo Rocafuerte es muy unido, y las se\u00f1oras se llevan muy bien entre ellas. El d\u00eda de nuestra entrevista con Sra. Astromelia era el cumplea\u00f1os de una de las socias, por eso sirvieron unos bocaditos y cada socia aport\u00f3 un poco de dinero para regalarla. \n\nSra. Astromelia tiene 44 a\u00f1os, es casada, y tiene 4 hijos, de los cuales 2 son mayores de edad y 2 son menores (de 15 y 16 a\u00f1os). 3 de ellos viven con ella todav\u00eda. Ella y su esposo tienen un estudio de fotograf\u00eda, llamado \u201cEstudio Arely\u2019s\u201d por su hija, Arely. Su esposo tambi\u00e9n trabaja como profesor, entonces ella atiende el negocio durante la semana mientras \u00e9l est\u00e1 en clases. Su hija tambi\u00e9n les ayuda con el negocio. Iniciaron el negocio porque el sueldo de su marido no les alcanzaba para pagar sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas, y a ella no le gustaba mucho al inicio, pero ahora s\u00ed le gusta, aunque dice que siempre llega muy cansada a la casa al fin del d\u00eda. Trabajan todo tipo de eventos, como por ejemplo matrimonios y cumplea\u00f1os, normalmente 1-2 por semana, y trabajan tanto con c\u00e1maras digitales como de rollos. \n\nLa se\u00f1ora est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito a la Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR para invertir en la compra de materiales para su negocio, como por ejemplo papel, qu\u00edmicos, \u00e1lbumes y una c\u00e1mara. Dice que su sue\u00f1o para el futuro es jubilarse para poder descansar, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 pensando en poner algun negocio en la misma casa para no tener que salir m\u00e1s de la casa para trabajar. \n\nElla ha sido socia de su banco comunal para a\u00f1os ya, es socia fundadora y el banquito en s\u00ed es bastante antiguo, el grupo ya tiene 32 ciclos trabajando juntos. \u201cMe ayudan bastante,\u201d dice de los pr\u00e9stamos. Solamente una vez hace 4 a\u00f1os tuvo un problema para pagar su cr\u00e9dito, aparte de eso ha sido muy puntual. \n","en":"Mrs. Astromelio is a member of the Rocafuerte Community Bank and is in a group of 21 women who live in the town of Rocafuerte, which is approximately half an hour from the city of Portoviejo. The city is very well-known for the sweets that it sells. The group Rocafuerte is very united, and the women get along very well. The day of the interview with Mrs. Astromelia was the birthday of one of the members, so they served snacks and every member contributed some money to give a gift.\r\n\r\nMrs. Astromelia is 44 years old, is married, and has 4 children, of whom 2 are adults and 2 are younger (15 and 16 years old). Three of her children still live with her. She and her husband have a photography studio, called \u201cArely\u2019s Studio,\u201d after their daughter Arely. Her husband also works as a teacher, so she takes care of the business during the week while he is in classes. Her daughter also helps them with the business. They started the business because her husband\u2019s salary isn\u2019t enough for them to meet their basic needs. At first, she didn\u2019t like the business very much, but now she enjoys it, even though she says that she is very tired when she comes home at the end of the day. They work at all kinds of events, like weddings and birthdays. They normally work once or twice a week, and they work with both digital cameras and cameras with film. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR to invest in the purchase of materials for her business, like paper, chemicals, albums and a camera. She says that her dream for the future is to retire so that she can rest. She is also thinking about having some business in her own house so that she doesn\u2019t have to leave home to work.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for years. She is a founding member, and the bank is very experienced. The group has already worked together for 32 cycles. She says that the loans help her a lot. Only once, four years ago, she had a problem of repaying her loan, and apart from this, she has been very punctual.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":363549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy paper, chemicals, albums and a camera for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astromelia Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":277.72,"local_amount":277.72,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":277.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035134},{"amount":137.12,"local_amount":137.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":137.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947390},{"amount":66.41,"local_amount":66.41,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":66.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789235},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789236}],"funded_date":"2009-09-01T19:49:47Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":130906,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

This became worse when her two children had to go to college.\r\n\r\nWanting to sustain the education of her children in college, Cecilia had to make her business profitable by growing it. Thus, she decided to join ASHI to be able to have access to additional capital.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Cecilia\u2019s business started to grow until the time has come when Cecilia now has to request a larger amount of capital. She has to increase the volume of the various fish she buys and sells in her fish stall in the municipality\u2019s public market.\r\n\r\nSomeday, Cecilia wishes that, out of the profit her business makes, she will be able to purchase a vehicle to be used in her business for selling and buying a larger volume of fish in far off places.\r\n\r\nCecilia is so happy for having loans for her business because her profits have enabled her to send her two children to college. Her eldest is a commerce graduate while the second child is a college undergraduate. Whatever life they will be having in the future, Cecilia will be very happy to turn over her business to her children

Half of the members sell snack food, the rest sell groceries and have a computer business.  Marisel Shirley, the president of the group, has been a wholesaler of telephone cards for the past 10 years.  Julia has had a snack business for 15 years.  AyD. has a snack shop and has also had a general store for 10 years.  Leoncia has been selling groceries for about 20 years.  Amanda has had a business for 6 years.

Freddy has had a small restaurant where he offers lunches and other meals for 23 years.  Nestor Hector has been making glass for 15 years.  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, in general the group has a great deal of experience in their respective areas.  As with all businesses in the country, there is competition, but the good thing is that each group has its season. This group is going to invest in order to make money during the Carnival parties.  The loan will be used to purchase more merchandise to stock a business such as a snack stand, or for a person who makes meals to have a stand in the market.  The people with computer businesses will purchase accessories that they will sell, the glass maker will purchase frames and glass for sale and for his monthly jobs.   \r\n\r\nThe business people who request loans from Agrocapital hope to improve their businesses with the help of the loan.  They hope to improve their children's education, improve their quality of life, and to grow and expand their businesses.  The members of this group are experienced with loans and are very accustomed to working with loans as they already know how to use them in their businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":478737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisel Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leoncia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ross Aurelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nestor Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21025,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1994.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2017.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2065.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2089.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2113.52},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2138.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2163.07},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2188.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":284.58,"local_amount":1994.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1997.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909421},{"amount":287.9,"local_amount":2017.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909422},{"amount":610.67,"local_amount":4279.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4286.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944997},{"amount":880,"local_amount":6167.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6177.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673336},{"amount":308.64,"local_amount":2163.07,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707356},{"amount":312.24,"local_amount":2188.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2191.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707357},{"amount":315.97,"local_amount":2214.43,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890877}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T23:29:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":176422,"name":"Soan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soan C. is from the village of Balulang, Cagayan de Oro City.

She is a very joyful young woman who really wants to get ahead in life. She lives with her husband in her mother's house and what she wants the most is to have a better future.\r\n\r\nSince the time she was very young, she felt that she had to work as much as she could. That is why, when she was 17 years old, she began to sell fast food. With those earnings she was able to get the money together that she needed to buy 2 cows. Together with the lambs that her mother gave her, she has been able to get ahead little by little by selling cattle.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her job is feeding her animals, since she has a lot of affection for them. She has been doing this for 7 years and thinks that the hardest part is transporting her cattle to the city market. With time, she hopes to increase the  number of animals that she has, since she thinks that it is time to grow. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan that Maximiliana has had with MFP.

He has learned to raise them well so that he can market them. Khusravjon is not married and lives with his large family. As the oldest brother, he has to work hard to support his family.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Today Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ella inici\u00f3 este negocio puerta a puerta  en el a\u00f1o 2004 entusiasmada por su c\u00f3nyuge,  que se dedica a la litograf\u00eda y  haciendo trabajos a los laboratorios conoci\u00f3 los que hoy son los  proveedores de Ruth Mar\u00eda y a los que  inici\u00f3 compr\u00e1ndole  $200.000 COP,   en productos naturales como los ya mencionados;    gradualmente  Ruth ha ido adicionando otros art\u00edculos, como ropa, fantas\u00edas, cosm\u00e9ticos y casi todo lo que sus clientes necesitan para su vida diaria, porque ha  aprovechado efectivamente  la gran clientela que se desprendi\u00f3 de su negocio inicial de venta de productos naturales. Sus principales clientes, son los habitantes del barrio y muchos referidos de estos en  otras comunidades; Ruth Mar\u00eda es una muy buena empresaria que les acredita  a sus clientes  solo lo que ellos pueden pagar  y en los plazos acordados, por eso recupera su cartera semanalmente y algunos en cada quincena. Ella compra de contado y adquiere frecuentemente descuentos, porque sus proveedores la conocen muy bien y a su vez sabe como negociar sus compras. Su margen de contribuci\u00f3n es del 40%   con respecto a los productos naturales,  recupera esta  inversi\u00f3n con la primera cuota, pero regularmente las  divide en 4   plazos de pago de acuerdo a cada cliente y tambi\u00e9n hace algunas excepciones con un peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de sus compradores ofreci\u00e9ndoles plazos especiales un poco m\u00e1s largos,  pero no muy usuales.  Relacionado con la mercanc\u00eda que distribuye su margen de contribuci\u00f3n  es de 45% y los planea con sus clientes en 2 cuotas. Su sue\u00f1o ahora es tener un punto de ventas en un sitio estrat\u00e9gico, pero sabe que se requiere un capital inicial importante y por eso est\u00e1 trabajando fuertemente para lograrlo. Con su Credikiva que es su primer financiamiento comprar\u00e1 productos naturales que tiene encargados por sus clientes y tambi\u00e9n jeans, calzado, ropa interior y especialmente vestidos para ni\u00f1os, teniendo en cuenta que en las fiestas los padres de familia vestir\u00e1n a sus peque\u00f1os con nueva ropa y estos a su vez lucir\u00e1n los vestidos de Ruth Mar\u00eda con mucha alegr\u00eda y distinci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Ruth Mar\u00eda N. lives in Soledad\u2019s Los Almendros neighborhood where she sells natural products and assorted merchandise.  It is quite usual to find vitamins and Omega 3 among other products like costume jewelry, and cosmetics in her store.  She also sells footwear, underwear and children\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\nShe started the business around 2004 encouraged by her spouse to do so.  He is a lithographer and while doing jobs for laboratories he got to know the people who today are Ruth Maria\u2019s suppliers and from whom he originally bought $200,000COP worth of natural products like the ones already mentioned.\r\n\r\nGradually Ruth has been adding other items like: clothes, jewelry, cosmetics and almost everything else customers need in their daily lives because she\u2019s known how to take advantage of the vast clientele that her initial natural products business generated. Her main customers are residents of the neighborhood and referrals from them who live in other areas.\r\n\r\nRuth Mar\u00eda is quite a good businesswoman who floats her customers just the amount of credit they are able to repay in the time agreed upon.  Thus she recovers her outstanding debts weekly and some biweekly. She, however, pays cash so often gets discounts because her suppliers know her well and she is very good at negotiating her purchases.\r\n\r\nHer recovery margin on the natural products is 40% and she usually gets that back on the first installment.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Marry has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marry joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marry has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Marry is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Marry from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

La chacra que ten\u00edan no era suficiente para mantenerse ya que los frutos, no ten\u00edan mucha rentabilidad, es por ello que decidi\u00f3 trabajar como empleada del hogar, donde conoci\u00f3 a Dagoberto que ahora es su querido esposo. Tiempos despu\u00e9s Adela con el poco ahorro que ten\u00eda m\u00e1s el de su esposo decidieron abrir un bar, donde ahora expenden licores, y toda clase de bebidas. Para ella los mejores d\u00edas de venta son los fines de semana y feriados, dicho bar cuenta con un amplio lugar de esparcimiento. Esta feliz con este negocio ya que le genera un buen ingreso econ\u00f3mico. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por el que ella esta comprometida en cancelar puntualmente con el pago de sus cuotas. Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 contenta con los de su banco comunal, porque son puntuales con el pago de sus cuotas. Con los 1,500 soles que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de m\u00e1s licores para abastecer su bar.\n\n","en":"Adela, 25, lives with Dagoberto, 24, and their son. They live in their own house located in the Silvia neighbourhood. \r\n\r\nAdela, who is consistent and fights for her goals, explains that a few years ago the financial situation in this part of the country suffered from stagnation due to social and economic instability. Because of this and the death of her mother and father she was unable to finish her schooling; she had 5 younger siblings to look after. The farm they had was not enough to support them as it wasn't very profitable. That's why she decided to work as maid, where she met Dagoberto, her beloved husband. \r\n\r\nSome time later, Adela and her husband used their small savings to open a bar, where they sell liquor and all kinds of drinks. For her the best days for the business are week-ends and holidays. The bar has plenty of room for recreation. She is happy with the business as it generates a good income. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to repaying it on time. She is also very pleased with her community bank, because everyone repays the loans on time. She will invest the 1,500 soles requested in the purchase of liquor to stock up her bar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":899459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy liquor for her bar.

She comments that she needs a loan in order to buy items that she does not currently offer. She learned about Adim, a local organization, from a woman at the local market who works with the organization. She visited the office, gathered the information and formed her group, so they could all meet with Adim.\r\n\r\nYahaira has been working in this business for years. She learned the business from her mother. She hopes to get ahead with this loan together with her partners in the group; she hopes to be able to give her son a college education.\r\n\r\nShe travels 3 days of the week outside of her community, and one day of the week she goes to Managua to buy the clothing and spices. The other days she spends taking caring of her family and going to Adim to make the group's loan payment. She is very organized about her time and her business.\r\n\r\nHer husband helps pay the household expenses with his work on a farm. Yahaira plans to make improvements to their home. Yahaira has received several training courses; they have helped her to better manage her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva

Los Angeles Village Bank, which meets once a month in the town of Huayllacocha, where she lives. Zoila is sixty years old and is the widowed mother of three children, all of whom are now adults with families of their own. Zoila\u2019s main business is selling \u201cjora,\u201d the fermented corn used to make chicha, a traditional Andean corn beer. She buys dried corn in 14-kilo sacks for $7 apiece, soaks the corn to ferment it, and resells each 14-kilo sack for $10 soles to local chicha producers. She works seven days a week selling jora at the market in Izcuchaca, a large town about thirty minutes away that serves as a transportation and commerce hub for the Anta region. She usually works from 6:00 am to 3:00 or 4:00 pm, depending on business, and earns about $20 per day in profits.

She is fifty-five and is a mother of three children. Atyrgul and her husband are in the sheep-breeding business. In the beginning they had to save diligently in order to purchase their first livestock. Eventually they were able to buy a cow, and later they started to breed livestock and sell it as necessary. It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of having livestock for Atyrgul and her husband: with the income they earned they were able to build a house, give an education to their children, and even bought an apartment in the capital. Atyrgul and her husband also grow vegetables in their own garden. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the livestock-breeding business, Atyrgul keeps cows and sells milk. Just the monthly profit from the sale of milk is about 2700 soms (local currency). But twenty years ago, when they just started their livestock business, they were able to buy their first cow for only 1000 soms. Nowdays a cow costs almost twelve times as much. Atyrgul and her husband know the value of time. When they raised their children they tried their best to give them an education and the freedom to choose their profession. And the children have made their choice: they decided to go into police work. The eldest son is twenty-nine and is married. He is a police detective. The middle son is twenty-seven and he is not married yet. He works as as a detective as well. The youngest son  has not yet finished college. Atyrgul wants to purchase an additional dairy cow. Without a loan it will take her a long time to save up enough money. She really hopes to obtain this loan so she can realize her plans. She would would like to get her two younger sons married and also to increase the size of her flock. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtyrgul has three partners in her group:\r\n\r\nRahat A. is thirty-seven. Rahat is raising four children. Her husband is a construction worker. Rahat stays at home and takes care of her five year-old-son. However, she also finds enough time to tend her livestock and sell milk. Rahat would like to get a loan to purchase a bull.\r\n\r\nRoza B. is forty-two. She and her husband tend to their sheep and cows. They are raising three children. The eldest daughter is sixteen, and the youngest son is seven. Roza is seeking a loan in order to purchase sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\nDinara O. is thirty-six. She is a mother of three children. Her spouse is a self-employed electrician. Dinara has a home-based retail business. She would like to get a loan in order to purchase a stock of goods to sell.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

E. is the president of the loan group Nyota. Dressed in the black dress, she is raising her hand in the photo. She is a client on her 16th loan cycle, 34 years old, married, and mother of three children, all of whom attend school. Her husband is a small trader of various products. Kahambu W. E. sells diverse products like suitcases, small chain jewelry, dresses, blouses, pants, women's boubous (traditional clothing), skirts, shoes, etc. in her small shop. Sometimes family friends buy her products.\r\nShe began her business with her own funds from her husband. Her initial capital was $100. This allowed her to launch a business selling rice. A short time afterward, in collaboration with her husband, her business evolved into a small boutique. She has now done this work for 13 years.\r\nWith a loan from IMF Hekima, Kahambu W. E. wishes to increase her sales by purchasing six suitcases, four female boubous, six blouses, six skirts, and ten Manzaza chains. Kahambu's biggest challenge is that she still rents (at home and at her workplace). Thus, all of her business profits go to pay her rent, estimated at $20 per month. Sometimes, her lessor insists that she guarantee nine months' payment.\r\nIn the future, Kahambu W. E. plans to grow her business and leave the communal bank for a united group which offers many operational advantages in terms of increased credit, interest tax, and repayment deadlines. Moreover, in the near future, Kahambu wishes to buy a plot of land and, god willing, a car. In ten years, she intends to open a second boutique in the center of Goma. She plans on getting supplies from the world's large commercial centers, either in Dubai or in China.\r\nKahambu thanks the IMF Hekima for the loans she received without any material guarantee because, thanks to these loans, she has already equipped her house, she manages to meet her children's needs, and her business is prospering. \r\nThe Nyota group is made up of 16 members, the majority of whom are female.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":532491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of six suitcases, four female boubous, six blouses, six skirts, and ten Manzaza chains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.
