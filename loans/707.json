He is 38 years old and went to school until the 12th grade.  He is married, and he is the father of 2 children.  The first is 5 years old, and the second is 1 year old.  Only the oldest is in school.  Calisto left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, after he finished the 5th grade.  His oldest brother was transferred to Namaacha and he came with him.  When he arrived he continued with his studies, and consequently he earned a scholarship to be a legal assistant.  He found work in the courts as a legal assistant, but as his institution was not acredited, he did not have the right to a salary.\r\n\r\nThe school entered into contracts, and he was one of the beneficiaries.  He is already on the staff as an assistant instructor.  He works from 7:00am until 12:00pm and earn a monthly sum of 5,900MT.  Besides teaching he has also does advocacy work for his clients who, in spite of being delayed, have had success in the cause process.  Calisto, with help from his wife, who is a health official, was able to collect enough money to begin his work, but he was unable to finish so he approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to continue because the rain causes his bricks to break very easily.\r\n\r\nBesides his children, he is responsible for  his sister and nephew who live with him in his house.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 15,000MT will be used to purchase construction materials to finish his veranda that is being eroded from the rain.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan before maturity and request another to finish the maintenance as well as paint his house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":303436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T17:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Calisto Simeao ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":813.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":847.34},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":882.16},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":918.41},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":956.16},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":995.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1036.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1078.95},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1123.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1169.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1217.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1267.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1319.64},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1373.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.2},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.19,"local_amount":813.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":850.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35994951},{"amount":32.48,"local_amount":847.34,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":885.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44577727},{"amount":33.82,"local_amount":882.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":921.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52971092},{"amount":35.22,"local_amount":918.41,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":959.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190919},{"amount":36.65,"local_amount":956.16,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":998.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618800},{"amount":132.1,"local_amount":3446.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3599.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056648},{"amount":136.19,"local_amount":3552.87,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3711.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971596},{"amount":137.35,"local_amount":3583.04,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3742.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708741}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T20:08:59Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":105646,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Delia es socia del Banco Comunal Golondrinas.\nDelia es casada, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y 5 hijos, Delia junto a su esposo se dedican al alquiler de maquinarias de construcci\u00f3n a instituciones.

(0) is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Maninoa, Siumu. She is married and has six adult children.\r\n\r\nElena owns and operates a tailoring business, providing children's tailoring services to local community members. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Elena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,200 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nElena is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. The loan will be her 6th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her loans, which were used largely to buy food for chickens, have always been repaid punctually. In the next round, she would like to borrow 7.840.000 VND to invest in her livestock.

Bernadith is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Bernadith C.\u2019s Group\". \r\n\r\nBernadith is 35 years old, married and blessed with four children who are now school-aged. To make a living, she is presently engaged in farming and housekeeping activities. Her husband is a band saw laborer. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of activity for 10 years already. She\u2019s earning an average amount of not less than Php 2,000 a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nOn December 6, 2007, Bernadith joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  As an active member of Paglaum MPC under the PDP-LP, a micro-finance program that reaches out to rural communities, Bernadith has successfully repaid a loan amount of Php 14,500. She is now requesting a loan of Php 5,000 as her 5th loan which will be used for  house repairs and renovation.

She is requesting her first loan for 1,000 WST, which she will use to purchase baking equipment. Elisapeta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":932494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

from Tanzania! Sheila is the owner of a Mama Lishe or local caf\u00e9 in Dar es Salaam. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business is a restaurant or caf\u00e9, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. As a forty-year-old divorced mother of four (one of her children is still in school), profits from the caf\u00e9 are essential to helping her family satisfy their daily needs. Sheila started her caf\u00e9 in 2002 and has since been earning a monthly profit of 200 USD, which she uses towards school fees and food for the family. Sheila is requesting a loan of 275 USD to expand her caf\u00e9 and help propel her business to increased profits and her family to an improved standard of living. The loan will be used to purchase cutlery, crockery, and more chairs for her customers. Sheila is a hard worker who can be found at her caf\u00e9 for long hours every day of the week! Sheila would like to be successful enough to expand her caf\u00e9 to other locations.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Both are studying in elementary school while she works from 8 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday.  With 19-years of service as a health worker, she requests a loan to start on the construction of her house.  She would like to build an 8-square metered house in Alcaldia de Juigalpa with the INVUR (Institute of Urban and Rural Housing).  Where Ms. Lidia currently resides she must pay MINSA (Ministry of Health) which operates FETASALUD (Federation of Health Workers) and the conditions there provide no privacy for her growing children.

Each member is currently living in extreme poverty, and is not living with any of the luxuries that we often take for granted. Each member is hoping to take this first loan and get started on their very own small business. The ideas range from clothing stores to food markets. This loan will give an opportunity to 5 people who have not had many good opportunities in their life, and give them a chance to change their future.\r\n\r\nSanta J. is the representative of this group and is extremely excited about this opportunity. Santa is the mother of two young children and realized she needed to do something when she couldn't afford school for both her children.

agriculture business is one that requires much effort, for the simple reason that it requires sun exposure, the physical exertion of moving animals from one place to another, as well as the work it takes to tend to various crops. Abdukayum, has dedicated himself for already twelve years to cattle raising, which supports his humble family which so relies on him.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Abdukayum has turned to IMON International for a loan of 1000 USD to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him, but also his dearest children and wife who he loves greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two children, ages 12 and 16. They live in Esquilan, which is a community in the Colcapirhua province of Cochabamba. Isabel works in dairy production, and Carlos works in drilling.\r\n\r\nIsabel had various problems in December of 2009; that is when her husband suffered a serious drilling accident that maD. them realize that the company and the job paid poorly. She had to sell her cows in order to help pay for her husband's operations as well as for her children's schooling. Carlos' parents did not want to help; she paid everything herself. Carlos was left without a job -he couldn't walk- and this year in February, he went through another operation for his spine, which went well because he has begun to walk and has started physical therapy in order to be able to work and help his wife and kids. Isabel is a woman who never left Carlos' siD.. In those moments when he was in bad shape, she never lost her faith or hope that Carlos would succeed and fight to become well.\r\n\r\nIsabel is asking for this loan to be able to buy a new head of cattle and so she can to produce more milk and make farm cheese to sell at the Quillacollo market. With this help she can earn more income until her husband is totally recovered and that they can work together so that their children can have careers and a better future and, above all, to teach them the value of life and to continue supporting their father so that he can return to work. Together they are a very united family, and they have dreams they hope to achieve in the future, such as the youngest son who wants to study medicine in order to help children of poor families in their neighborhood and to also help people who need it, like his father needed help after his accident. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva

He is married and the father of 12 children. He lives at home in the Dabani borough of the San Prefecture (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nOver 20 years ago, he opted for the commerce of televisions and related accessories, a business he learned from his older brother. For the past ten years he has been running his own business at the main market in San. He is in high demand, particularly during the weekly market fairs in San and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nTo diversify his activities, he decided two years ago to call upon the Soro Yiriwaso MFI. He is requesting a third individual loan, having fully reimbursed the two preceding ones. Mr. Abdoulaye will use this loan to buy different televisions, DVD and VCD players (with 14, 21, and 26-inch screens).\r\n\r\nHe used to get his supplies from wholesalers in San, but as he increased his working capital, he now would like to go as far as Lom\u00e9 (the capital of Togo). He sells in his shop at San\u2019s main market and in weekly market fairs, to a customer base of both men and women, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nHe is hoping to attain monthly earnings of 175,000 FCFA he will use to reimburse the loan, pay his children\u2019s tuition fees, buy food, and reinvest the remainder in other revenue-generating activities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":540151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy electronic appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":170121.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961545},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699664},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85061,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913553},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180713},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85061.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476685}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:20:28Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":204844,"name":"Sashi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sashi A. is a farmer in the village of Sainbu-Bhaishipati, Lalitpur.\r\n\r\nSashi owns a piece of land where she grows green vegetables; mostly she prefers to grow seasonal vegetables.

Taba-ao, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and selling fish.  Her husband Deonesio V., who is 54 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  They have 7 children who are 17 to  34 years old. Carmencita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmencita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use purchase more fishing nets and repair her existing nets so that she could continue to save up for future and also repair and improve their fishing boat. Carmencita V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a resident of San Pedro, San Jose Antique, Philippines. She is married to Ruby S. who is a driver and they are blessed with four children. They are Julier who is 36 years old, Glen who is 34 years old, Zaldy who is 31 years old and Charlene who is 29 years old. Through their hardship, industry and the support of ASHI, two of their children have  finished college.\r\n\r\nHer loans in ASHI really help them a lot because the income that they get from her business is used for their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nAzucena has been a member of ASHI for eight years already and, because of her good attitude, she had been elected as center chief of San Pedro Center 10 of ASHI ASB at present. As a member, she maintains her good performance, which is why she got a bigger loan. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to have a loan from ASHI, through the partnership of KIVA, for PHP 24,000 to use as additional capital for their hog fattening and tricycle businesses.\r\n\r\nIf this request is granted, it will be a great help for them to sustain the needs of the family and to help their relatives and neighbors.\r\n\r\nTheir greatest dream is to build a decent and comfortable house with their income and to improve their business so that they will be financially stable.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":635650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"As

eleven and twelve. She is thirty-five years old. She started her ice-cream business in 2005. She works six days a week for four hours a day and is assisted by two employees. She earns a monthly profit of about $100 from this business. Pendo is requesting a loan of $450 to purchase another refrigerator and additional containers. She thanks you for your support.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so she can use it while in process of paying back her loan \u00d0 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":202005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a refrigerator and additional containers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-15T18:50:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pendo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-29T20:47:52Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-10-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373738},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347980},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970554},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886771},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436031},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130304},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027135},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613175},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010258},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232569}],"funded_date":"2008-09-15T20:47:52Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":68812,"name":"Pepe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pepe A., 50, is married with 4 children.

Kedepan setelah menerima pinjaman ini rencananya akan dibelikan bibit babi penggemukan sebanyak 2 ekor dulu disamping sekarang di rumahnya juga sudah ada babi-babi dari modal sendiri yang dipelihara. Harga bibit per ekor berkisar Rp.350.000,- dan sisa pinjaman nanti akan digunakan untuk biaya pakan babi selama 6 bulan pemeliharaan. Luh Eka berharap bisa mendapat keuntungan mencapai Rp.500.000,-. Hasil pelihara babi ini diharapkan bisa meningkatkan penghasilan keluarganya dan mampu membiayai anaknya yang masih kecil.","en":"Increased pressures from day to day living expenses, made Luh Eka could not depend on field farming with her husband. Luh Eka tried to increase results from pig farming which is already her side job mornings and evenings. But seeing results from pig raising is quite good,  Luh Eka decided to increase her pig populations by borrowing capital from DINARI for Rp.3,750,000,- (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp10,000-12,000.00) for a period of 6 months, and payment at period end after the pigs are sold.

Zone VI, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a pig-fattening business. Myrna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past sixteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5200, improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventeenth loan, she is borrowing PHP 17000, which she intends to use to buy more inventory to sell in her general store.  With the increased income, she will continue to save up for the future education of her child. Myrna J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Purok Bugnay, Barangay Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her buying and selling of Nipa and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $114. \r\n\r\nJocel is now borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can purchase more materials.  This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With this goal in mind, she opened her business. For more than four years, she has run a grocery store.

& 3 (source for the development). She lives in the beautiful town of Samana with her long term partner and their two children. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n\r\nFiordaliza is receiving her 7th loan with Esperanza Internacional. She started having Esperanza loans and became a member of this group around 4 years ago when she was started doing some business to help her family's income. She is selling cosmetics from a popular brand and who sells their products through their catalog.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Aidos delivers meat to three local cafes for use in their food preparation. He also has individual customers who buy his meat on a regular basis. In order to expand his business in the past, he has previously received four loans from local banks and has always been reliable in paying these loans back. Because of his business success, he has managed to build a one room house for his family, though he would like to add on to this house in the future as his son gets older.

She is married to Rogelio, 48 years old, a farmer and a supportive husband. She is the loving mother of four children, the oldest being 22 years old and the youngest 2 years old. Erlinda is an optimistic mother who knows she will overcome all challenges to achieve her dreams.\r\n\r\nThe income of Erlinda and her husband is not enough to cover the expense of their family. Therefore, in 1999, she got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.),  a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines. Since then, she started a small farming business and it really helped them to meet their needs. She has now been in business for more than ten years. \r\n\r\nCurrently on her sixth loan, Erlinda requests Php 30,000 as additional capital for her farming business. She believes that her proposed loan will be a big help and will contribute to the growth of her business. She has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-Kiva for her business to gain more profit and to use that profit to support the daily expenses and education of her children.\r\n\r\nErlinda has been an ASHI member for eleven years. ASHI paved the way for the achievement of the dreams of her family: to send her children to school and to have them finish their studies with a degree. In addition to this, though, she didn\u2019t stop dreaming of her children having stable and happy families in the future.\r\n\r\nErlinda is very thankful to ASHI for its kind-hearted support of her dreams. She is also hoping that, with the help of ASHI in their lives, it will do much to help them provide a sustainable life and have a comfortable house to live

She began to look for a way to realize her dream of having a professional career that would enable her to get a good job and help her family financially.  That was when she learned about being a beautician and she began doing haircuts, hair styling, hair relaxing, pedicures, and manicures.  With the help of a neighbor who left her women\u2019s clothes on consignment on easy terms, she began to sell, and the next year went out on her own because she was doing well.  She put in some of her own capital and began to travel to Barranquilla where she brought women\u2019s clothing.  Later on her current partner joined the business and increased her micro entrepreneurial experience.  They diversified what she was selling with a new line of products in catalogs such as perfumes and cosmetics.  She didn\u2019t stop working as a beautician since she had all the equipment and knowledge in the field and also her customers were asking for her services.  Currently the family income comes from her businesses and she succeeded in completing her high school and wants to finish more studies related to her work. She is now asking for her first loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to buy supplies for her beauty business and merchandise, mainly purses, shoes and women\u2019s clothing.\r\nIn the future she dreams of having her own house, planning for the stability of the children she wants to have, and she also wants to help people get their own capital, as she was.  She lives in an area that is a mixture of families and big businesses.  That is an industrial zone of Cartagena and this helps her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: pig Fattening, livestock and sari-sari (general) store businesses. Her husband Arneto M. Sr., who is 36 years old, buys and sells livestock to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are 1 to 13 years old.\r\n\r\nVisitacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Visitacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped increase her monthly income to PHP 48,000, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her various business activities so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only seven per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ana\u2019s business success has helped her support her family, which consists of one child of her own and eight dependents from her extended family.  With the large demand from neighborhood children, Ana can make a clear profit of about USD 20 a day, Monday through Friday.  She uses the money mostly for her son\u2019s educational fees, food for her large household and of course to make her weekly loan repayment.  Her next business idea is to expand her ice-pop business into a full food stall where she can sell a variety of treats and cooked foods.

from Tanzania!  Agatha is a young Tanzanian entrepreneur; she is only 24 years old. She has established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, about 1.5m by 1m, often with a border (called pindo in Swahili) along all four sides , and a central part (called mji) that differs in design from the borders. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print applied by a rotary printing machine. Most often it is a multicolored, dark wax print on a lighter background. Kitenge is similar to the kanga, but of a thicker cloth and has edging on the long side only. Kitenge is also a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\nSales from Agatha\u2019s store enable her to earn approximately $US200 per month. She is requesting a loan of $US275 in order to purchase wholesale quantities of cloth that she can retail for a handsome profit. With these increased profits, she hopes to expand her business in the future.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Otgonbayar is 30 years old and lives with her husband and two children in Zavkhan province in western Mongolia. Her son and daughter both attend a local secondary school, and her husband is a taxi driver. They all live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian housing tent. Otgonbayar operates a small grocery trading business in her town. Currently, due to a lack of having an adequate selling location and place to store her products, she only operates her business during the summer. Otgonbayar started her grocery trading business in 1999 when she began growing and selling her own vegetables.

Viqui is the most senior member and is the president of the group.  She works by weaving and making macram\u00e9.  She will use this loan to buy wool wholesale and ribbon and to diversify her products so she doesn't only weave items for children, but also for women and men.  With this increase in products, she will be able to increase her income and quality of life.  Adriana is participating in her second loan.  She is the secretary of the group and works for a cleaning company.  Since her wages don't let her cover all of the costs of supporting her family, she decided to start another business by weaving macram\u00e9.  With this loan, she will be able to buy materials to make her blankets for which she takes orders and will improve her and her family's income.

It is one of the most visited places by tourists from all over the world. The villagers are very hospitable and well-wishing people. One of them is Mira B., the leader of this group.\r\n\r\nWhen Mira\u2019s husband died, only her newborn son gave her the strength to go ahead. She totally dedicated herself to her son. Still, a wound that has never healed sometimes cuts the ground from under her feet but, looking at how her son is growing up and how he just looks like his father, she understands that life is terrific.\r\n\r\nAlso, Mira has understood that wishes do not wash dishes, so she has had to do something for a living. With 500 KGS ($12) in her pocket, she started her little business selling a particular sort of potatoes, which later on turned out to be big business. Now Mira deals with the harvest of potatoes and sells them in the market. Her revenue is 3,450 KGS ($80) and she gets a pension of about 716 KGS ($16). She is planning to provide education for her son and to buy a house.\r\n\r\nMira decided to buy 500kg of potatoes with the loan which she wants to obtain from Mol Bulak Finance.\r\n\r\nAnarkul K. is a forty-seven-year-old married woman with three children.

Her husband is a worker and earns 15,000 KGS ($340) in the summer. She has a shop where she sells daily foodstuffs and her revenue is 10,000 KGS ($227) per month.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She has been consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her ice-cream business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 8,000 loan. This amount will be used as additional capital for buying equipment and raw ingredients needed to continue the production and supply of ice-cream.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.

Baod, Bantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and buying and selling of firewood. Her husband, Librado M., who is 45 years old, works as a carpenter (foreman) to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 13 children who are between 2 and 23 years old. Two of her children are married, three are working and four are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nNarcisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Narcisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Narcisa M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\t\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

province) where he lives now. Dayirbek is 49 years old. He was born and grew up in a big middle class family with eleven children, but after graduating from high school he could not continue his education in the university due to a difficult financial situation. Dayirbek has enrolled in a technical school with a major in veterinary and at the same time was helping his parents in business. In 1982-1985 he served in the army which helped strengthen his character. After returning from the army Dayirbek began to work in his home village as a veterinarian and to this day the village residents come to him for help. In 1996 in search of an additional source of income for his family he decided to start a business in farming which gave big profits as at that time Dayirbek got married and his daughter was born. Dayirbek started his business with 20,000 KGS and bought just one cow and one calf for feeding, and at this time he has one milk cow, one horse and ten sheep.\r\n\r\nRight now Dayirbek needs financial help in the amount of 60,000 KGS to increase the head count of cattle and expansion of business because education expenses are growing. He has to start saving money now for his children's education in a good university so they can get a decent education.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

business venture, providing dressmaking services to local community members.  She has many years of experience in this business.  Makerita needs a loan of WST 1,000 to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Makerita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Because they lack collateral, most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks.  This is Makerita's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n  \r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She has been doing this for 10 years. \r\n\r\nLeonora would like to further develop her business. She has insufficient funds so she is asking for a loan of P10,000 to buy eggs, pork, cabbage and noodles to cook and sell.\r\n\r\nSomeday, Leonora would like to cook different types of meals so that she may keep satisfying her customer's demand for delicious food. This way, she could earn more profit and make her family more successful."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":941155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

In the future she hopes to expand her business and buy a vehicle so that she can make sales in the interior of the country.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":293541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To buy natural remedies like camomile tea, boldo fruit,anise,flax seed, barley etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.333333 -57.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-03-25T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":555555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35988107},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44569253},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:50:56Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959511},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176781},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602393},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038623},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951088},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":555555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793239},{"amount":108.36,"local_amount":555555.52,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":556833.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683994}],"funded_date":"2009-03-26T02:08:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:44:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":101630,"name":"Lucrecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Lucrecia S. has already been a widow for eight years.

She is a mother who always takes care of her responsibilities, and she lives in her own house with her partner with whom she has 3 children. Giving her children the opportunities that they need to get ahead in life is what motivates her to work long and hard.\r\n\r\nFarming is part of her life, and a basic source of income, but unfortunately, her patch of gladiola, in which she invested more than 4000 Sols, was flooded due to the constants rains. She and her spouse feel unable to repair the damages, but they still hold on to the hope that they will be able to plant again and recoup their investment. Gloria is waiting for the water to evaporate to allow the bulbs (which contain the seeds) to mature. She will then harvest the seeds in order to get back some of the initial investment. The good thing is that once she has the seeds, she will be able to plant new patches, which will get her money back in 8 months. For the moment, her other crops will be enough to provide for the basic needs of the home and the education of her children. This is the 5th loan she has sought from MFP, and she has not had a single problem with her payments in the past, since she has always paid on time. She is very active in her community bank, and always thinks about the well-being of her fellow members. With the money that she's asking for, she will buy chemical fertilizers for her other patches of potatoes and gladiola.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cyrus Maher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":322576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-24T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3045,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996786}],"funded_date":"2009-05-24T22:43:25Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cyrus Maher","image":null}},{"id":113918,"name":"Mukaram","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He started working as an farm worker and little by little was able to acquire a small land parcel where he usually plants forage (alfalfa) and tubers. He tells us that he can't plant the whole lot because of its closeness to the sea. Its land is salinated and the crops don't survive in that type of soil. \r\n\r\nThat is why his business of raising and selling sheep is so important. It supplies the income he needs to support his family. He raises the sheep in a corral installed in the back of his house and sells them to dealers who usually visit the area where he lives.  The forage he plants is used to raise the sheep. \r\n\r\nSebastian wants to maintain his alfalfa crop to assure good feed for his sheep.
