She is a tailor who offers her great services to her neighbors. Her earnings are used to help cover her household expenses. Her work and her financial contribution have enhanced her self-esteem and her self-confidence. Djumagul is very proud of her work. This is the third time that Djumagul has requested a loan from IMON International, a Kiva partner. Having said this, Djumagul has an excellent history of on-time repayment. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has five children: four daughters and one son. Even though one of her daughters is married and her son has gone to Moscow to work, after having reached the age of forty-seven, she still has to look after her other three daughters, the smallest of whom is just four years old. For the sake of that she is engaged in stock-raising. \r\n\r\nMainly, Gulzhan purchases calves and feeds and resells them. Her husband helps her after work. She started this business twenty-five years ago with just eight dollars. Now her monthly income is 150 dollars!\r\n\r\n\u201cCattle-breeding is not the most profitable business. It is not sitting in a clean office gazing into a monitor, doing accounts. Anyway by raising cattle, we\u2019ve been able to buy a house, furniture, home equipment and even pay for the marriage of our eldest daughter,\u201d says Gulzhan proudly. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Gulzhan needs a loan to increase her livestock population, fatten it up and resell it. In the near future she is going to have a new shed built and a hay-loft, as well as finishing the building of her house, buy her son a car and pay for another daughter\u2019s wedding. \r\n\r\nGulzhan has four partners: Nurzada, Baktijar, Dilbar and Dzhanatkul. Dzhanatkul works as a cook at a school lunch room. The rest are occupied with cattle-breeding. All the members need loans mainly to purchase more livestock, so that they can resell it later.\r\n\r\nNurzada inherited four sheep and one cow. Now she has ten sheep and two cows. She wants a shed to store fodder, after buying a car to get married.\r\n\r\nBaktijar started with buying sheep. Then he bought horned cattle. For the moment he has sheep, oxen and a horse.\r\n\r\nDilbar and her husband used to save money to buy cattle. Now the\u0443 have a cow, a calf and sheep. She wants to buy a car and pay for her son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\nYears ago Dzhanatkul bought a cow which provided seven liters of milk a day. Now she has three cows and gets twenty liters a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She began this business on the recommendation of her parents and since then she has worked doing the feeding and cleaning at the farm.   During the morning she goes out to cut alfalfa which serves as forrage for the animals. Afterwards, she ends the day by cleaning out the sheds, where she extracts the excrement, using it as fertilizer for her plants. When the weekend comes, she goes out to sell her animals, and in this way she has been able to obtain good profit.  The goal that she has proposed is enlarging her farm.

Luego de que sale el producto lo acomoda en una paila de plastico y sale a venderlo de casa en casa y de negocio en negocio.

She has two daughters and five sons, and is married.  She lives in La Aldea de La Concepcion, in the municipality of Juticalpa. \r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been making and selling doughnuts and quesadillas for more than 15 years.  She learned this trade because she worked with a neighbor making the same products, and also learned thanks to several bakery courses she took at the Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP). \r\n\r\nHer business is located in her home, and still has no name. Her work schedule starts at 4:00 am, and she works with her two daughters.  They help her to prepare the dough, and then spend the time it takes for the products to be in the oven.  Once she takes the product out of the oven, she places it in a plastic container, and takes it to sell door-to-door to homes and businesses.  She thinks that her major advantage is that her products have a special flavor, and that additionally she is a friendly person who gets on well with other people and this helps her to make sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have premises in the town center, even if they are small, so that she no longer has to sell by foot and so can have an easier life, as she has diabetes and is still undergoing medical treatment.  Every time she returns to her home after finishing her daily work, she feels resentful of her health.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Alejandrina is requesting is needed by her to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter and other ingredients to make doughnuts and quesadillas.  With the help of this loan, she will be able to generate earnings and cover her medical costs.  She will also help her husband with the financial upkeep of the household, as he works in agriculture and has little income.  She also would like to make improvements to her home.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has had several years receiving support through FAMA through the provision of loans, which she has punctually paid back and which have helped her to keep her active business going and to improve her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":862398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-08T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784957},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589354},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3060.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547449},{"amount":325,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6121.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758087}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T20:52:32Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":336831,"name":"Las Hero\u00ednas De Labranza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c9ste Banco comunal se llama \u201cLas Hero\u00ednas de Labranza\u201d, lo conforman 17 emprendedoras que se dedican a diferentes rubros entre los cuales se encuentran picadura de le\u00f1a, fruter\u00edas, verduler\u00edas, venta de ropa, venta de miel, ensaladas preparadas, venta de huevos y confecci\u00f3n de ropa.

will later sell in parts, going door to door. She has been doing this for 3 months and says that it's going well and that her household income has increased a little bit.\r\n\r\nShe started the business after her mother-in-law proposed it; she already has a business making bread and selling plastic goods, so she couldn't go from house to house. She gave the chickens to Silveria because she had children who could help her with the sales, and they are getting good results.\r\n\r\nWhat she wants most is to continue in this business and also making bread so that she can support her children in their education. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Angelina, who sells plastics and makes bread; and Everfein who buys and cells calves.

The group members are all neighbors from Yanahuapa, a small town about fifteen minutes outside of the city of Urubamba, in the Sacred Valley. Though this is Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa's first loan from Arariwa, many of the group members have previously participated in group loans, either through Arariwa or through other local financial institutions. \r\n\r\nAt the group's inauguration on March 26th, there was a warm, friendly atmosphere. After singing Peru's national anthem, the group members ate a celebratory inaugural meal of chicken, baked potatoes, corn and cheese in a spicy cilantro sauce, joking and laughing together all the while. The group's loan officer, Alfredo L\u00f3pez, told the group that the seed capital they are receiving now may seem like very little, but soon their investments will bear fruit, and that single seed will produce 200, 500, or even 1000 seeds. \r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses: they work as artisans, raising livestock or small animals like guinea pigs, growing grains, vegetables and flowers, as grocery store owners, and making and selling chicha, a traditional Andean alcoholic drink made from fermented corn. \r\n\r\nThe group's president, Juan Gualberto A. G., teaches at the local school and also buys and sells cattle as an extra source of income. He currently has three Brown Swiss cows, and is feeding them so that he can sell them for a higher price. He plans to use his loan to buy seed to plant more grass for his cattle. This is Gualberto's first group loan, and he hopes to lead the group well in order to help its members get ahead in life and expand their businesses. \"This organization depends on all of us working well,\" he told the group. He reminded them that everyone must attend all of the group's meetings, make payments on time, be punctual and responsible, and show solidarity with the other group members. \r\n\r\nThe Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa group has agreed to work according to these principles and to repay their Kiva loan in full and on time. \r\n\r\nNote: Three people in the photo are not group members.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ten years ago she became interested in revenue-generating activities, in particular the retailing of firewood and smoked fish. She enjoys a solid reputation in what she does and receives many orders, mostly in winter.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy a demanding and ever-increasing customer base, she called upon Soro Yiriwaso. After five individual loans, all correctly reimbursed, she is now requesting her sixth loan, which will be used to buy five cartloads of firewood from villages in the vicinity of Sikasso, and five boxes of smoked fish from Gao (seventh administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nShe sells the firewood from her home and retails the smoked fish at the market, for cash or credit to a diversified range of customers.\r\n\r\nShe hopes the loan will help her achieve monthly earnings of 115,000 FCFA, which will serve to cover personal and some family expenses, and pay off the loan. The remainder will be reinvested in the business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":507369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy firewood and smoked fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746551},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779097},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961297},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699422},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913342},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180516},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476553},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613343},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751827}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T19:38:41Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":189316,"name":"Mabatini Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdul M., age 32, is married with three children, ages 10, 8 and 5.

Her previous loan of P18,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing P8,000 for her 13th loan which she intends to use for her general store.\r\n\r\nLeonida is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

","en":"Mar\u00eda, 43, lives in her own home with her two children.  Since her childhood she has embroidered creative designs on skirts that are typical of the area where she lives.  She works daily at home and on the weekends she sells her works of embroidery at the local markets in her area.  Her main customers are merchants who sell typical costumes and this is why she must advance daily with her production in order to produce higher quantities of items.\r\n\r\nFor her, having supplies on hand is key because then she can advance problem free.  Alongside this activity, she also raises pigs which she sells in her area markets after three months of fattening.  She states that she enjoys the embroidery work more because it doesn\u2019t require much physical exertion.  In addition, she feels that this work doesn\u2019t have any loss because the items aren\u2019t perishable like food.  She is taking advantage of the festive season in her area because orders are increased.\r\n\r\nThis is her 11th opportunity with MFP.  She is happy to know that she can count on financial help because she has always been responsible with her repayments.  Additionally, she enjoys being part of a communal bank because all the members are responsible and support each other.  Also, she is grateful to all the people that made the loan possible because it will be very useful for her business\u2019s progress.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda will use the funds to buy raw materials like thread and fabric in assorted colors and varieties that she needs for her embroidery because she is aware that she must capitalize on this season when orders increase.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":566625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724891}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T21:23:53Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":217994,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily M. is from the village of Minante 2, Cauayan City, Isabela.

She is separated and lives alone in her own home.  15 years ago she decided to generate her own source of income by farming and raising animals.  She also has a store in which she sells a variety of basic goods.  Her daughter is in charge of that business.  Each morning she goes out into the fields to tend to her crops while her cow and her sheep graze on pasture.  She takes some of the crops she harvests to sell in other towns and sells some in her store.  During all the time she has been working, she has seen the fruit of her labor in the profits that she has made.  For this reason she is looking ahead to increase her production and intensify the sale of her animals.\r\n\r\nThis is the 9th loan which she has had from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support from MFP because they know she is a person who is responsible in making her repayments.  She likes being a member of her community bank because all the members are people who she knows.  They are all responsible and very supportive of each other.  She thanks all those who will help fund her loan since it will be very useful for her in making progress with her business.  She will use the loan to buy sacks of fertilizer for sowing her next lot of corn.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":637402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-11T15:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":837.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195710}],"funded_date":"2010-11-13T12:33:24Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":250782,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph K.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In addition, he likes working in the fields and the income he earns when he sells his crops which allows him to cover household expenses.  What he doesn\u2019t like, on the other hand, is the infestations that affect his crops; he must always be on the lookout for them and alert to any outbreak of them.

After several years spent at his sides, he finished by opening his studio. He has run this business for fifteen years. The strength of his sales is due to the genius of his products, known by all in S\u00e9gou. The difference between him and others is linked to his sense of creativity.\r\nHe enjoys a clientele composed of women and men.\r\nIn the intent of increasing his turnover, he is asking for this new loan. He has been in relation with Soro Yiriwaso for twelve months, after one individual loan correctly repaid. He is at his second individual loan, which he intends to use to purchase one sewing machine for thick wire. He stocks up in the area. Monsieur Bourama does his transactions in cash and sometimes on credit. With this loan he imagines making a monthly profit of 100,000FCFA. This profit will allow him to make his repayments to Soro Yiriwaso and to settle his operating expenses.

But the mill does not belong to him and he has to make a tally at the end of each day and make do with what is left over. With his experience in this matter, it has become clear that this could be a very profitable activity if the machine belonged to him. He therefore aspires to buying a mill for grating cassava, with which he will improve his income and his quality of life. To do this, he is asking for a loan of $1,200.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur D.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mislima is 45 year old. She is married and has two chidlren. She owns a specialized fabrics store at the central market in Dushanbe town. Mislima works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses in Tajikistan are very popular and very important item of the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabric vendors in the market where she works. She is very tenacious and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 11 years. Mislima is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Mislima has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop. She would like to continue seeing her venture grow. Today she is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni to increase her assorted inventory. With your help, Mislima will be able to make her business succeed and support her children with education.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zoila has been working as a seamstress since she was 15.  She is now 63 years old.  Zoila is widowed and has five adult children.  She is currently caring for her two-year-old granddaughter Jimena.\r\n\r\nZoila has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for 2.5 years and is a member of the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  Zoila used her very first loan of 300 soles to invest in sewing materials and in the sale of cooked foods.  She will use this loan of 1000 soles for the same purpose: Zoila plans to buy fabrics and other materials for sewing and also basic food products for her other business, preparing and selling cooked food from her home in the evenings.  \r\n\r\nZoila's goal is to leave an excellent sewing workshop to her daughters Doris and Fiorella when she passes on.  Zoila is grateful to Manuela Ramos not only for the financial support but also for the educational sessions given by the organization's loan officers at her communal bank's monthly meetings.  Zoila feels that these sessions help her to learn a little more than what experience alone can teach her.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Most of the villagers know each other very well which creates an environment of trust. Walking down the clean streets of San Andres one can see many people chatting and children playing. This is a typical village where people help each other out with their daily tasks. \r\nFortunately, this cultural factor is also reflected in Las Rosas\u00b4 organization. Some members of the group are better doing the paperwork and arrange the meetings, whereas others have more acquaintances that can help the younger ones of the group to sell their products to a bigger group of customers.\r\nThis is how Do\u00f1a Manuela C., who is one of oldest of the group, helps the younger members. She has a store in one of the main streets at which she sells traditional blouses. Do\u00f1a Manuela is very well known in the village because of her store. When a customer asks her about clothes she doesn't sell in her store, she refers them to group members like Ami. Ami is one of the younger members of the group. She also sells blouses, but from a different type, they are called croshet blouses, they have a very different look from the traditional ones.\r\nAlma G. is the president of the group. She has a sister in another group who enthusiastically told her about Friendship Bridge. Alma, formed a group with her friends and neighbours who, like her, mostly work in buying and selling clothes. \r\nThey all want to invest their credit in purchasing a more diverse repertoire of clothes. The other four women, who own a food store, also want to expand the diversity of products in order to capture more clients and increase their sales. \r\nLas Rosas want to keep working hard in order to keep building their new improved life. They wish to have a solid business so they don't have to leave their families behind in order to go and sell their goods at far away markets. That's why they try to communicate well to one another about their business ideas so they are not over-supply San Andres with the same goods, says Catalina. \r\n Las Rosas are doing a great job a working together and accomplishing unity within their trust bank, with your support they will keep working in this manner and accomplishing their dreams.

She is 41 years old and attended school until the 8th grade.  She is married and the mother of 5 children between the ages of 22 and 29.  Three of her children are in college, and the others are working.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the 8th grade Ticana had to interrupt her studies due to the poor financial conditions of her parents.  She left Manhi\u00e7a for Marracuene with her husband who served as the Director of Agriculture in that district for 5 years.  Because she had a good level of schooling, Ticana was invited by the administrator to work as his secretary. Two years later her husband was transferred to work in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, so she abandoned her job.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived in Namaacha Ticana got a loan from her oldest sister and began her business of raising chickens with the help of her husband who is an expert agronomist; an activity that they continue today.  Besides being a great chicken farmer she is also owner of a food shack, but because the chicks require a lot of attention she does not have fixed hours of work.\r\n\r\nShe makes at a maximum 5X100 boxes of chickens at 35MT and resells each one for 85MT.  She raises them in phases to be able to sell alternatingly.  Her best product is a ready-prepared chicken that she sells from her stand.  She makes 4,000MT per month but is only able to save 500MT because she has to pay expenses for her children who are studying at the university, and her husband had problems in the service and lost his job.\r\n\r\nThis is Ticana's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The first loan of 15,000MT was used to purchase chickens and she was able to repay without any difficulties.  She is requesting this second loan of 12,000MT to reinforce her business.  She is confidant that she can pay off the loan before maturity so she can ask for another loan to construct a wall around her residence.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

He and his wife are monogamous and live with their children in the Torakabougou quarter in the city of Bougouni (in the 3rd administrative region in the Republic of Mali). Not having gone through the education system, he quickly began trying to make a living, namely daily work with masons, shepherding and other jobs in the countryside. None of these activities succeeded for him. Thus, he decided to take up the purchase and sale of various shop items. He took his first steps into the business with his older brother, a specialized merchant in general commerce. With five years\u2019 experience, Mr. Souleymane S. has well mastered the holding of, and resulting business from these various products, which are very sought after in Bougouni.

So when her parents who previously owned the farm supplies store she now operates decided to pass on the business to her, she had mixed feelings - excited because it had the potential of providing a steady income, enough to support her family, and at the same time she was doubtful that she could make a go of it, especially as she did not have the necessary working capital to buy stock for resale.\r\n\r\nSo when a friend told her about NWTF-Project Dungganon, she grabbed the opportunity to join and gain access to a credit line that she badly needed to make her business survive. She also admits that the discipline of paying back her loans made her realize the importance and value of good financial management.\r\n\r\nNow on her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anecita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to enable her to buy more stock for resale in her farm supplies shop.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than $1\/day to realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

trabajar para ayudar a su madre porque el papa muri\u00f3 en un accidente de tr\u00e1nsito en la cual ellos quedaron solos y la madre de Deisy es una persona ya mayor y ella tiene que hacerse cargo de su hermano como tambi\u00e9n de madre al ser la \u00fanica responsable de su familia y tratarle de ayudar  ella es una persona que le duele el haberlo dejado la escuela porque ella so\u00f1aba con estudiar  medicina para saber el porqu\u00e9 su hermano ten\u00eda ese problema la situaci\u00f3n en la cual se encuentra Deisy es muy triste porque ella tiene que ser la responsable de su hermano.\n\nElla solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de soya para poder aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche y la elaboraci\u00f3n de quesillo y teniendo m\u00e1s ingresos podr\u00e1 ofrecerle a su familia un mejor nivel de vida y seguir con el apoyo constante a su hermano y  tal vez en un futuro ella tiene la esperanza de terminar el colegio ella no sue\u00f1a con tener su propia familia porque no quiere que le lastimen a su hermano ella lo quiere mucho porque \u00e9l es un muchacho muy tierno y ayuda en la casa con las vacas y a veces se va a cortar alfa con su madre a quien quiere mucho y no la deja sola. \n","en":"Deisy is 27 years old.  She lives with her mother, Francisca L., and her brother, who has Down syndrome.  They live in Esquilan Chico to the south of the road to Quillacollo, which is a province in Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nDeisy is a hard-working girl, who devotes herself to milk production and making \u201cquesillo\u201d (soft cheese) with her mother.  She has worked since she was a girl.  She was contributing in order to help with her brother\u2019s education.  In our country it is ignored.  People with Down syndrome are rejected.  They are not offered the help they need to get ahead.  The help centers are in the city.  It is very far for Francisca to be able to take him there for help.  \r\n\r\nThat is the reason that Deisy had to leave school to be able to work to help her mother.  Her father died in a transit accident, and they were left alone.  Deisy\u2019s mother is elderly.  Deisy has to be in charge of her brother, like a mother, as she is the only responsible person in her family.  She tries to help him.  It hurts her to have left school because she dreamed of studying medicine in order to know why her brother has this problem.  Deisy is very sad to be in this situation because she has to be responsible for her brother.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy soy in order to be able to increase the milk production and the making of quesillo.  Having more income will allow her to offer her family a better standard of living and to keep up her constant support of her brother.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future she might be able to finish school.  She does not dream of having her own family because she does not want to hurt her brother.  She loves him a lot because he is a very affectionate boy.  He helps at home with the cows, and sometimes he goes to cut alfalfa with their mother.  He loves her a lot and does not leave her alone.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

They give us the experience which later helps us improve our lives and make a better living. The heroes of our story also regard the difficulties in life just as good practical lessons for the future and definite steps toward a better life. \r\n\r\nFeruzahon M. is the leader of this group. She is forty-two and has four children. One of her children is disabled. He has a disability of the 3rd degree. Her husband is in Russia at the moment. He has gone there in search of a job. To provide for the family, Feruzahon tends a cow and a calf and is occupied with farming. Her eldest daughter works as a seamstress and thus helps her mother to meet their daily needs.  \r\n\r\nDue to cattle breeding, farming, and her husband\u2019s support they have been able to build a new house. Recently they have even managed to repair three rooms. Feruzahon is planning to marry off her daughter and provide her disabled son with a good treatment. But to achieve all this she needs to save sufficient funds. Therefore, Feruzahon has decided to apply for this loan to buy a cow to raise. \r\n\r\nHalidahon M., 46, is a mother of three children. Her eldest son is a baker and her daughter is a seamstress. Halidahon\u2019s husband works as a private builder. Currently Halidahon is engaged in the repair of their house. She needs this loan to finish the repair and prepare for her son\u2019s wedding. \r\n\r\nOdina A., 47, is a farmer. She used to grow wheat in the past, but now she grows potatoes and sunflowers. As for her husband, he is working in Russia. Odina has two children. Now, she needs a loan to purchase mineral fertilizers for potatoes and sunflowers. \r\n\r\nHalimahon I., 48, is divorced. She is looking after her old mother and her two children. To provide for the family, Halimahon is engaged in cattle breeding and also works as a nurse. She hopes to obtain this loan and purchase three sheep for fattening and resale. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hermenegilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to purchase piglets to raise and the feed needed to raise them. She also intends to use some of the money as revolving funds for her ice cream business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Hermenegilda F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He earns additional income from his business of selling shoes to the local market.\r\n\r\nFabiano has made a loan request of 80,000Kes in order to cultivate his banana farm.

He has a workshop in the 'grand march\u00e9' of Sikasso, and is much sought out by his ever growing customer base. With a view to better servicing this growing customer base, he decided several months ago to approach the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is his first individual loan. Zakaria sells his appliances (TV, radio, mini HiFi systems, DVD etc) in his repair workshop to customers - mostly people who have brought in equipment for repair. With this first loan, he intends to purchase 10 DVD players, 5 29 inch TVs, 3 mini HiFi systems, and some CD players. This equipment comes from the Republic of Ghana. With this loan he expects to generate a monthly profit of 200,000 FCFA which will mostly be used to contribute to the family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and the rest will be invested in the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":985027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase electronic equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T22:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zakaria ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":251199.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140101},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":251199.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251828}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T11:52:49Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alistair Assheton","image":1674519}},{"id":788240,"name":"Quilla Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal QUILLA, \u00e9l banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia Paulina continua con su negocio de restaurante, la socia es una persona responsable y empe\u00f1osa, la socia continua elaborando desayunos y almuerzos para todos sus clientes que le solicitan, la socia lleva buen tiempo con su negocio el cual le trae satisfacciones personales, siendo de esta manera que la socia saca a adelante a su familia.\nLa socia solicito el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de arroz, carnes, menestras entre otros.\nLa socia se siente agradecida por el cr\u00e9dito otorgado y se compromete a cumplir con sus cuotas establecidas.\nLas socias que salen en la foto adjunta pidieron permiso para llegar tarde  a la reuni\u00f3n por motivos de trabajo.\nLos dem\u00e1s socios se dedican al negocio de restaurante, artesan\u00eda, venta de comida, maestro constructor.\n","en":"The member belongs to the communal bank QUILLA.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She explains that she has been operating this business for 3 years and that she is hoping to expand to the point that she can purchase her own shop.  Mama notes that she serves her customers with respect and talks to her customers in a courteous manner in order to encourage them to continue buying from her. <p>\r\n\r\nMama and her family depend on the success of this business for their day-to-day needs.  She has been facing financial difficulties as of late: for one thing, her business is not particularly large, so her profits do not fully cover her family's living expenses at this time; further, her husband is sick, so she is carrying the entire burden of providing for the family.

He is 44, married, and the father of 2 children who are 17 and 12.  Both of them go to school.  He only studied through the 1st grade and didn't continue because he lost his parents very early.  He lives in his own home and supports one nephew who lost his mother.  He left Manhi\u00e7a for the district of Boane in 1969 because he changed jobs.  He previously decided to build his home and to start a family in Boasne.  He has had his own business for 19 years.  He sells basic goods from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. with the help of his wife.  He manages to make around 1,000 meticais a day and saves some every month in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another financial institution.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his neighbor who also is a client of the institution.  This is his third loan and it is for 25,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy basic goods for his business (sugar, margarine, rice, etc.).  His previous credits were for 10,000 and 15,000 meticais, which were both used for the same purpose.  In the future, he hopes to request more credits to be able to expand the growing area of his small farm and to reinforce his products for his business to respond to his customers' demand.<br

She is 51 years old. Perla is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Perla owns and operates a specialized retail store, selling \"polvoron\" in the local community. (\"Polvoron\" is a common dessert in the Philippines, a powdered milk candy similar to shortbread.) Perla has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Perla joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Perla has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Perla is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients for making polvoron. This will be her 3rd loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Muhamad is 49 years old. He is married with two children. Muhamad has a small cafe where he sells breakfast, lunch and dinner. When he first started his business he only opened to sell breakfast because he worked at night. Once his place became more popular he was able to dedicate himself to the business full time. \r\n\r\nMuhamad wants the loan so he may invest in tables, chairs and utensils. He is asking for 4500 Somoni. With this money, Muhamad will be able to expand his business, to earn more profit and in turn help his children move forward to complete their school studies and further continue studying at the university. The well-being of this family is in your hands. Contribute to the growth of his business and they will be grateful. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

T., age 46, lives in the municipality of Paraiso of Osorio, department of La Paz, in her own dwelling and accompanied by her husband, Se\u00f1or Juan Panamanian, and their 4 children:  Ever, Juan, Noemi and Jairo ages 26, 19, 17 and 15 years respectively.  Juan is retired and receives a pension that fails to support the needs of the family.  For this reason Adela decided 9 years ago to start her own business.  Speaking with some professors of the National Educational Center of the municipality in which she lives, she was permitted to open a cafe there in which she began distributing to her clients foods like nachos and chips, pupusas (a biscuit-like flat bread made from maize) in the morning, natural refreshments and a good variety of delicacies for children and youths of the educational center.  Maria Adela has worked hard to make her business prosper and thanks to her effort this has been possible.  Now she has decided to pursue a new idea, that of offering lunches both to the professors and students of the school.  This has gone over very well.  Her clientele is growing, given that they recognize that her culinary tastes are exquisite as well as appreciating the amiability of Adela, her husband and her children and the cleanliness of the place.  To satisfy the demand of her clients for new dishes and to offer a greater variety of products, she is requesting this new loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva

Eleonor is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Eleonor from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is always looking for better opportunities, which led her to purchase a cow and sell its milk going door to door, day after day. With time, she has succeeded in purchasing four heads of milking cattle, and she already has regular customers that she sells the milk to. \n\nGregoria gets up very early in the morning to milk the cows, then she puts them out to pasture while she goes to sell the milk. Later she returns home to prepare lunch and send her children off to school. Then she takes care of herding the cattle to graze alfalfa (food for cattle). When the afternoon draws to an end, she milks the cows once more. She uses this milk to prepare yogurt, which she also sells. \n\nGregoria comes to CIDRE [the field partner] requesting a loan to purchase soybean husks so her cattle can produce a greater quantity of milk.

She earns her living by operating a bakery\/cake-making business and a food vending business. Her husband Eldifonso, who is 39 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have eight children who are between 4 and 16 years old. Analiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Analiza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to buy a motorcycle for her bakery so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children and build a new house. Analiza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

I buy some already grown and others I raise from the time they are small.  I already have customers who regularly come for the cows and take them away.  They pay for the cows about two weeks later.  I don't have any big problems with my work.  The main challenge is keeping the animals and their place clean.  I get into the pen to sweep and remove all the manure.  It is also a bit expensive to feed them when one wants to have the cows nice and fat.  I sell livestock to help my family.  For example, sometimes when I go to collect payment I bring milk, food, and fruit and deliver it on the way.  I also give my children money when I can when they are going to school or I help them with clothing.  My goals are to improve myself and for my family to live better.  This is why one works--so that their family doesn't lack anything and so they can live better.  I invest my earnings and take what is needed for the family.  I have two children.  I have been married for 17 years and we live in our own home.

After a while, she started to get bored and began thinking about what she could do.  She enrolled in a wood painting and jewelry making course.  Asuman started making jewelery and selling to those around her. When she learned that the municipality was going to open an art bazaar for women, she made an application. She was given a stand and began selling her wood paintings, the jewelry she made, and lingerie that she bought in Istanbul at the bazaar.  Later, she heard from a woman in the stand next to her about Maya and applied for an individual loan.  \r\n\r\nAsuman has been working in the bazaar for six years and with Maya for five years. This will be her first Kiva loan. She will use the capital to buy jewelery and wood supplies and to buy a wider variety of lingerie products to increase her sales.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she wants to increase her profits.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nMore about IMON International\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.
