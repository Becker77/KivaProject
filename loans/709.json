It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, he does not have the money needed to make repairs.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Dionisio will be able to maintenance his taxi, reupholster the seats, and replace the tires so that he can continue providing service to his customers.  A vehicle that is in good condition will help him avoid an accident.  He is satisfied with the benefit of these loans because they have been useful to his job and have helped him support his family.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives in the commune of Rugombo (Cibitoke Province).   Her husband is an elderly farmer; she sells kerosene which is used in many rural households for kerosene lamps. This is a business that she has been in for one year, whereas she just lived from farming before that. She was able to rise above the physically demanding work of farming thanks to Turame.  \r\n\r\nCassilde is the mother of 8 children, three daughters and five sons, of whom two are already married. Three of them are students, but she is also responsible for the school fees of two other children, one of whom is an orphan from her family. She hopes that her children will be able to finish their studies successfully so that they can help her when she is old. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she is counting on adding to her working capital and her business, by buying kerosene in bulk to grow her income and thus be able to cover her day-to-day expenses for food, school fees, and other household costs. Since she sometimes sells on credit to some of her customers, she affirms that she sometimes has trouble with late payments from these customers. \r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for Turame's and Kiva's initiatives since no collateral is needed in order to request a loan, contrary to banks and other microfinance institutions. She is a member of the Ubumwe II group, which means in translation \"United\", and she is on her second loan with Turame. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pakistan. Khanewal is famous for its shrines. She lives in a two-roomed brick house with her family, and she moved here with her family 30 years ago. Zaib is 56 years old, married to M. R., and the mother of five children \u2013 three sons and two daughters. Her four children are receiving an education except her eldest son who completed his education until 10th standard and couldn't continue further studies due to financial constraints. He now works as a property dealer in a company.  \r\n<br>Zaib's husband is a rickshaw driver. He has been in this business for the last five years and it enables him to manage his children's education expenses. His eldest son contributes financially to his family as well in order to keep things running smoothly. Zaib has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband because he has problems driving his rickshaw. With the loan, he will repair its engine and give it a new look by replacing the old seat covers with new ones.

The roads are bad, and because the markets are outside, the rain can really disrupt the sales.\n\nMichel is excited to be taking his 1st loan with Esperanza after having heard about the success of others and the growth of their businesses. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business of footwear sales both in nearby Dajabon, Dominican Republic, and other communities in Northern Haiti. He will use the profits to continue to grow his business and help pay for the education and benefit of his family. In the meantime he plans to continue enjoying the work that he does in his church and community.\n\nThis Esperanza associate\u2019s story is representative of his group and of Esperanza's Haitian clients generally. His group is located in Ounaminthe, which is the town on the border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of Haiti, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

She is married and has two children, 2 and 7 years old.  \r\n\r\nChristiner owns a business that sells kanga and vitenge, traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women. Kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a piece of cotton fabric with wax print, printed using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Christiner needs a loan of US$125 in order to start a new business venture by opening a stand that would sell Coca Cola and other drinks that are popular even in the most remote villages in Africa. The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing; therefore, selling them has become a popular business venture. Chistiner thanks everyone for their support.\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: \r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her first child is already in university. Leonida was married, but her husband's family was upset that she did not give birth to more boys and chased her from her home in Nairobi. She is now suing him. <P>\r\n\r\nLeonida now lives in Manyatta slum, but she works in Nyamesaria. She runs two businesses, a beauty salon and a tailoring shop. Her challenges right now are too few customers. Her hopes for the future are to help her children so that in the future they can help her too. She likes running her own business, because when she makes a profit, it's hers and hers alone. She thinks women make better entrepreneurs because men often use the profits for drinking and being idle, a common refrain amongst many of the K-MET borrowers.<P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me (Kiva Fellow) greet Leonida saying \"Idhi Nade,\" which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Leonida responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as President Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo, saying \"Asante sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you,\" and \"Erokamano,\" which, in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are those of people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting.

Only one child still lives with him and his wife.  Since he was very little he has been planting citrus fruits like oranges, tangelos, and tangerines.  These products are very profitable for him, especially in summer time when they are in great demand in the capital city of Lima.  Therefore, for each trip he prepares 40 or 50 boxes to sell.  He sells them for 12 to 15 soles per box.  That is how he gets very good earnings.  Thanks to that, he was able to educate all of his many children; they lacked nothing.

She lives in her own house with her three children:  Nely, 23, Abel 21, and Nelly 9, who are the motivating force in her life.  Her grocery store is in the La Capilla neighborhood (an important neighborhood in the city of Juliaca).  Her store is one of the better stocked stores in the area so it is very busy.  Ceferina rises very early to tend to her customers since her main customers are residents of the area and they all start their work days very early.  What she likes most about her work is chatting with her customers and learning about the goings-on in her neighborhood.  She has been in this line of work for 15 years and feels that the hardest part of the job is withstanding the intense cold common in the mornings when she opens up for business.  For later in the future, she would like to enlarge her store so that she can offer better customer service.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is very happy to have gotten it.  She knows that she must invest the money in her business so that it will be more productive.  She is a very active member of her communal bank.

She lives in Common, Brgy. Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and coffee shop businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP8,000. \r\n\r\nLucia is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she could purchase more stocks to sell.  This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lucia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 42 years old. Sweetie Pie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Sweetie Pie owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Sweetie Pie has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sweetie Pie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sweetie Pie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Sweetie Pie is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Sweetie Pie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For years, he has been working in factories that produce roofing tiles, but not too long ago he decided to start his own business. Because of this, now he buys tree trunks that he chops by himself with an ax and then sells them as bulk wood in a market in the area. He works hard everyday, not only for supporting his five children, but also as an honest effort in order to provide his family with a safe and comfortable home.

She tries to put maximum effort into her family, as a helpmate to her partner and advisor and friend to her children.  Every morning, she begins her shift selling vegetables at a stand that she has in the neighborhood market.  She started her business with products that she bought in the city's central market, until one day she decided to partner with the people who distribute to the markets, which turned out to be an alternative that saves time and money.\r\n\r\nIt has now been 4 years that she has been making approximately 1800 soles every two weeks, as she is the only person selling vegetables, in particular, pumpkins.  Currently, Cleofe only does sales, but she has decided to get a truck in the near future in order to work as a wholesaler in the city markets.

Em 2002, Antonio resolve fazer o seu pr\u00f3prio negocio com o dinheiro que havia coletado e sai da casa do tio e aluga uma depend\u00eancia onde ele vive ate ent\u00e3o pagando mensalmente um valor de 500.00MT.

He was born in Vilanculos in a district of the Inhambane province.  He attended school through the 7th grade.  He is married and has a 2 year old daughter. \r\n\r\nAntonio moved out of Vilanculos to search for work with his uncle who lives in Namaacha, a town on the border with Swaziland.  He worked for his uncle for 2 years where he only earned around 150,000MT per month, an amount that didn't cover his expenses.  In 2002, Antonio decided to start his own business with money he had saved.  He moved out of his uncle's house and rented a place where he still lives for 500,000 MT per month.  He is now the owner of a shop that sells electrical appliances (located in the central market of Namaacha).  For 7 years his best merchandise has been radios, disks and cellphone rechargers acquired in Maputo for 1,000,000 MT x5, and 35.00MT x50 and resold at 2,200,000MT and 75.00MT respectively.  He has earned a profit of 5,000,000 MT and is able to save 1,000,000 MT per month.     \r\n\r\nHe supports his two siblings who live with him in his home and he has an employee who earns 1,200,000 MT per month.  He is building a house, as he really wants to live in his own home because renting is not at all easy.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with Hluvuku and his third with Kiva.  He is confident that he will pay back the loan without any problem.  The 15,000,000 MT will be used to increase his merchandise and finish building his home.  The first loans were all for his business (5.500,00 MT; 7.000,00 MT and 10.000,00 MT).  He is very grateful to Hluvuku and Kiva for having provided the financing to bring his great dream to reality. At the end of this year he will be able to live in his own home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

She lives in her own house with her 3 children and what she wants most is to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nHer sales stand is located in the Tupac Amaru market (the most important market in the city of Juliaca). She sells clothing and is a very cheerful and charismatic salesperson. In addition, Haydee takes advantage of the markets in nearby town and each month travels to Cuzco with her merchandise.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is talking with the sellers that work next to her, since this makes the long working days more pleasant. She has been doing this work for 4 years and what she thinks is the most difficult part is transporting the bundles of clothing to where she sells, since they are quite heavy.\r\n\r\nIn time, Haydee hopes to have a clothing store where she can provide better service to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is ready to make her repayments on time, as she would like to have access to other loans later on. She is a very active member of her communal bank and is well-liked by her colleagues. With the one thousand new soles she is requesting she will buy more clothing so that she can better stock her selling stand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva

She is the treasurer of the ALCANCIA COMUNAL \"SAN CARLOS,\" which has been working with EDAPRSOPO-PROSPERIDAD for nearly one year and five months.\r\n\r\nShe has been making slippers for more than 15 years.  Her business is small now, but it has not always been this way.  Filomina tells us that two years ago, on her husband\u2019s initiative, they decided to associate themselves with a friend of his.  They were going to open a shoe making business, since her husband\u2019s friend knew something of business.  Unfortunately, the partnership broke up after one year, so they decided to continue on their own, since they also knew something about doing business in the marketplace.  Things got a bit difficult when the city compelled them to formalize their business and they required papers and permits that took much time and money to obtain, but they got them.  Once formalized, they were required to pay minimum wage, tips, insurance, etc.  They were not prepared to pay these costs, so the business went broke.\r\n\r\nHaving had a bad experience, they moved and started over.  Their children helped with a small, but significant amount of labor.  They helped them move their machines and materials to their new shop.  She is convinced that, \u201cOne can fall, but with effort and support from one\u2019s family, one can rise again.\u201d\r\n\r\nFilomena also rents out the first floor of her home to earn an extra income.  Her plans for the future are to pay for her children\u2019s career education, to finish building her house, along with fixtures and finishing touches, and also to grow her business.

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Amalia K.\u2019s Group\".\r\n\r\nAmalia is blessed with four children, of whom three are now in their teenage years and the other one is an infant. To make a living, she decided to run a <i>sari-sari<\/i> store. She is also working as a Barangay Health Worker and she is receiving support from her husband who works as a government employee. For the past 10 years, she has been able to maintain her business and now she is earning an average net income of not less than 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month which is very helpful to secure their family income. \r\n\r\nUpon learning of the good news of Paglaum MPC being awarded the Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Awards 2006, she full-heartedly joined the cooperative in the year 2009. As an active member of the PDP-LP Program (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People), a microfinance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP as her third loan to be used for additional capital for her sari-sari store and for a new line of business which is rice retailing. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family and to meet their basic needs, as well as for loan repayments to PMPC, her child\u2019s education and for possible business expansion.\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In order to help with the family expenses, she has been working as a private teacher since 2003. And she also works in a local school. She works hard in different times to help her husband in the household, especially as they have a little child and they need to satisfy all his needs. She has arranged a special room with all the education materials to receive students. Today, she is requesting to borrow $800 to purchase a desk and a variety of children's books for the library.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

She lives in her own home along with her husband Henry, 35, and her two dear children Rosa who is 15 and Jorge who is three years old, to whom she wishes to offer a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nVanesa has a very nice job. She devotes herself to selling prepared foods, work that she does from her own home. Her food stand is very well attended by persons who wish to avail themselves of a delicious night time meal, her specialty being <A HREF=\"http:\/\/www.hoyummy.com\/2009\/12\/07\/puerto-maldonado-peru-breakfast-lunch-in-the-amazon\/\" TARGET=\"_new\">Juanes <\/A>and <A HREF=\"http:\/\/crispybeef.blogspot.com\/2006\/03\/recipe-tacacho.html\" TARGET=\"_new\">Tacacho<\/A> (traditional foods of the Peruvian rain forest). She has become very well known among her fellow diners for these dishes. When she began she was only selling half of what she sells now, but over time she built up and now is a large seller who not only offers good flavor but excellent treatment to her customers. \r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is cooking, as she was a fan of cooking from a very early age. She's had this business two years and believes the most difficult part is waiting on all her customers at the same time. Over time she hopes to raise enough money to set up a restaurant where she may offer better service to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with MFP and so she hopes for your collaboration so she may keep pursuing her objectives. At the same time she commits once again to making the payments as with her previous loans. In addition she is pleased to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible persons who support each other a lot. With the requested amount of 3,000 Peruvian soles she will purchase more ingredients and supplies for making more of the exquisite dishes her customers are used to having, as well as some items of dishware and table settings that she needs. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":953729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies for preparing food.

A job in the wood and furniture industry is a good one to have in Togo and the group Noviwowo has been a part of this artisan community for 3 years. They are entrepreneurs, responsible and conscientious of their customer's needs. They have already benefited from two previous loans and which they have paid back on a regular basis. They  are asking for a third loan to purchase more planks, rafters, saws and hammers so that they can continue with their work.

Thi Tran, 26 years old, joined the Fund in 2002.  She is very quick-minded and clever, which led her to the observation that her town does not yet have a salon or a wedding gown rental shop.  In order to get this service the people have to travel to the bigger town.  From this realization, she discussed her plans with her husband to go study cosmetology.  After gaining the necessary knowledge and training in this field, she and her husband were determined to invest some money in opening a salon, with the advantage of being right in town and accessible to the local townspeople.  After a short time her salon had become the destination for many brides and grooms in town.  As the business grew, their salon also expanded in size.  She has one child who is still in school.  In this round of funding her family is requesting 15,000,000 VND to continue investing in the salon.  Their average income is 3,000,000 VND per month.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean 26 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2002, nhanh nh\u1eb9n v\u00e0 kh\u00e9o l\u00e9o \u0111\u00f3 l\u00e0 nh\u1eefng y\u1ebfu t\u1ed1 quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh s\u1ef1 l\u1ef1a chon ngh\u1ec1 nghi\u1ec7p c\u1ee7a ch\u1ecb, th\u1ea5y r\u1eb1ng tr\u00ean \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n x\u00e3 nh\u00e0 ch\u01b0a c\u00f3 hi\u1ec7u trang \u0111i\u1ec3m v\u00e0 cho thu\u00ea \u00e1o c\u01b0\u1edbi, v\u1edbi  d\u1ecbch  v\u1ee5 n\u00e0y khi co nhu c\u1ea7u ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n \u1edf x\u00e3 ph\u1ea3i l\u00ean t\u1eadn huy\u00ean m\u1edbi c\u00f3, xu\u1ea5t ph\u00e1t t\u1eeb \u0111\u00f3 ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 b\u00e0n b\u1ea1c c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng th\u1ed1ng nh\u1ea5t ch\u1ecb \u0111i h\u1ecdc trang \u0111i\u1ec3m, khi \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 ki\u1ebfn th\u1ee9c trong tay ch\u1ecb c\u00f9ng anh quy\u1ebft \u0111\u1ecbnh m\u1edf c\u1ee7a hi\u1ec7u t\u1ea1i nh\u00e0.

S. lives in Vahdat district.  She is married and has a high school education.  She and her husband have five children.  Muzaym's business is buying and selling produce.  Early in the mornings, she purchases fruits and vegetables from local farmers wholesale.  Muzaym then sells the produce for a profit, allowing her to support her family.  Since she already sells a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, Muzaym would like to diversify the goods offered at her market stall.  She has applied for a 12-month loan to purchase additional inventory.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva

He lives with his family in a rented apartment in a commercial town called Bekwai, close to Obuasi (a gold mining town) in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The majority of the inhabitants of Bekwai are into commercial activities. Ussif is a tailor by profession.\r\n\r\nHe buys fabrics and accessories from Kumasi and sews for retail sale. He procures the materials and sews for people who place an order, but he does not charge a deposit. His shop is situated right at the main entrance of the local market square. As a result, Ussif says he wins many customers. He has been in business for seventeen years and has trained a number of apprentices who have graduated. He has some apprentices who are still in training. Ussif says he wants a loan to buy a variety of materials in bulk. It is his dream to put up a house for his family and to give his children the best education possible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":285212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric in bulk                             ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Obuasi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.2 -1.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ussif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36029690},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:59:38Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36029691},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44615990},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:31:58Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44615991},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:11:31Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53013446},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53013447},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:53:44Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63235483},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63235484},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73666858},{"amount":65,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":90.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73666859}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:15:28Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:18:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":98050,"name":"Ramatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ramatu M. is forty-two years old.

Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 10th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

V. is 42 years old. She lives in the Ciudadela 20 de Julio neighborhood in Barranquilla.  She is married and has two children who are 16 and 14 years old.  Her children's education is this admirable woman's greatest challenge. Both of them have illnesses that require specialists. She has a special needs son (next to her in the photo) and the other child has a skin disease. She is always watching over them; that is why in order to take care of them she works from her home with a small variety and refreshment store. She works all day, whenever the customer needs her.  She hopes and prays with much faith for a miracle from God: their recovery. \r\n\r\nShe began her business in 1994 and this is her fourth loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has demonstrated her excellence in making payments according to schedule. She is applying for the amount of  $2.000.000 to buy beverages, clothes, shoes and cosmetics and to fix her display case.  She has various suppliers of her products, among them, magazine distributors, stores from downtown Baranquilla and the Cervecer\u00eda \u00c1guila truck. This is a very important brewery of the Baranquilla tradition. She has a variety of clients, including neighbors, referrals, workers, friends and family. She maintains the business in the face of strong competition in her neighborhood with prompt and conscientious service.  In addition, the three loans that she has received in the last two years has allowed her to buy a display case, to pay bills and to accredit the business for merchandise. In the future, she dreams of having a locale with a well outfitted store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

V. lives with her spouse and children in the city of Malambo, in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla. She has seven children between the ages of 12 and 30 years old.  She prepares fried dishes and also sells various merchandise.  Yadira started preparing business lunches 10 years ago in Santa Marta, the capital of the Department of Magdalena.  When her husband was transferred to the city of Barranquila, she decided to go with him and continued her business because she has always had the support of her husband her children.  For this reason, she was able to start in a new location, where she remained for two years until she received a housing subsidy in Malambo, where she still has her home and continues her frying business.  As she is an enterprising woman and she started to meet many people, she started to sell bags, shoes, and household items.  She also purchased a sewing machine to open a clothing store.\r\n\r\nYadira has always worked independently which has allowed her to manage her time and to care for her children.  With her daughter of 21 years, she also learned to create crafts with foam, with which she has made decorative figurines and obtains additional income when she decorates items for parties or creates home furnishing and sells crafts by the dozen.\r\n\r\nShe learned of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and saw an opportunity to improve her business.  Before when she needed resources, she looked to the daily pay; although the resources were good, she realized that they were quite expensive and decided not to take part in these lenders. This is her first loan with this organization, amounting to $525, with which she plans to purchase 25 bags, 4 dozen sheets, 4 dozen towels, 7 dozen pairs of underwear and ingredients for fried foods.  Her goal is to continue to support her husband to continue to help her large family, increase her sales and income to improve her quality of life and that of her family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":547779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients for fried foods and raw materials for merchandise, such as 25 bags, 4 dozen sheets, 4 dozen towels, 7 dozen pairs of underwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-06-06T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72822},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75728},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77305},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78916},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80560},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82238},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83952},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85701},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87486},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89309},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91169},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":94814}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.43},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.23,"local_amount":72822,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:34Z","rounded_local_amount":75404.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895883},{"amount":87.62,"local_amount":166891,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":172808.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636216},{"amount":141.41,"local_amount":269351,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":278901.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117070},{"amount":45.06,"local_amount":85823,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":88866.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550596},{"amount":95.77,"local_amount":182416,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":188884.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688198},{"amount":95.98,"local_amount":182827,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":189309.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000849},{"amount":20.93,"local_amount":39870,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":41283.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288858}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T23:47:30Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn Ting","image":653228}},{"id":209520,"name":"Luisa Emilia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luisa Emilia Gonz\u00e1lez, es comerciante se dedica a la venta de repuestos de veh\u00edculos, fricciones, y repuestos de bomba inyectoras, es casada y habita en el barrio san Agust\u00edn no tiene hijos a cargo pues ya todos son casados y son independientes, su esposo tiene un taller de fricciones y reparaciones de motor de veh\u00edculos.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Luisa Emilia Gonz\u00e1lez, lleva ya 3 creditos con CEPRODEL,  y ha sido excelente cliente, con estos financiamientos ha logrado crecer su negocio y ha salido adelante, pues no le gusta depender de su esposo. \n","en":"Sra.

Her daughters help her with the business. Now she is asking for a loan of 3200 Somoni with a term of 12 months in order to expand her business so as to earn enough to be able to send her children to the university next year.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meanwhile, his brother was selling clothing and he saw that he had many customers and good earnings, so he talked about it with him and his brother helped him get started selling used clothing.

With the loan requested, she will invest in material to make more clothing items.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":506818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jadee Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blanca Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belinda Ofelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmery Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessferson Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ermelinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benadicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":468.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1316.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661447},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1316.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694107},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1316.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877071},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1316.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617044}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T15:53:31Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":189052,"name":"Fialelei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"The following social metrics for Fialelei N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nFialelei N. is 64 and widowed with 11 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Fialelei has 5 years of experience in this business.  Fialelei needs a loan of WST $3000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 talas or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Fialelei joined SPBD.    This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fialelei's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is from Barangay D. Fernan, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental. Dionisita has been in this business for two years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month. \r\n\r\nJust this year, Dionisita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Dionisita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP. This time she is requesting a loan of 5,500 PHP as her second loan to be used as additional capital for her snack vending activity. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family: specifically, to meet their basic needs, save for future use, make loan repayments, pay for insurance and her child\u2019s education and for possible business expansion. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Bocana, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a fish-vending  business. Her husband, Jerry B., who is 40 years old, works as a fish vendor and driver. They have three children who are 14 to 17 years old. Mary Joy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Joy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her twelfth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save for the future economic security of her family. Mary Joy B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is 48-year-old Rose Mango from Mwanza.  She is single and has two children between the ages of 12 and 19. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because he is an orphan. \r\n<p>\r\nRose has been running a pig and poultry business since 2004. The pig and poultry business is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients. Nguruwe means pig in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. They can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide protein. \r\n<p>\r\nRose works at her business for 12 hours per day, seven days per week, and is assisted by one employee. She currently earns about $150 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy more pigs. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rose thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027602},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613603},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010682},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232968},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664759}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T17:46:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":98082,"name":"Akua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akua S. is forty-seven years old.

O. is from the village of San Juan, Gingoog City. She is 45 years old. Guillerma is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Guillerma owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing vulcanizing\/tire repair services to local community members. Guillerma has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Guillerma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Guillerma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. Guillerma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Guillerma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to reinvest in her business and save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Such is the case with Mrs. Paulina (the woman standing up in the photo), who used to live in a prefabricated house for many years.\r\n\r\nToday, Paulina sells groceries at a market near her house; with the help of her husband, who works in a factory, she was able to build a humble house of good material using their savings.  But the house still lacks a roof and needs some finishing, such as coating the walls with cement, putting tiles in the bathrooms, and installing safer doors.\r\n \r\nPaulina wants to finish her house so that she can move her business there and so that she can make life more comfortable for her 3 small children, who are students.  At the moment, her eldest daughter takes care of the others while she is at work.  Thanks to her hard work and sacrifice, her wish will soon be a reality.\r\n      \r\nPaulina is satisfied with her achievements to date.  She tells us that none of this would have been possible without EDAPROSPO's support; they have given her three loans over the past 18 months.\r\n  \r\nShe will use this loan to expand her business, buying what she needs to build up a good supply of products in her store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ross Forman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":589768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock for her store ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3875,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Restituta Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo Miquiar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2700},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2700},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2700},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":968.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":968.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":968.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":968.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":968.75,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2711.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098170},{"amount":968.75,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390839},{"amount":968.75,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2711.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529119},{"amount":968.75,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2711.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665227}],"funded_date":"2010-09-14T18:33:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":230038,"name":"Joshua Obongo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joshua Obongo, age 31, is married with three children ages 1, 3, and 9.
