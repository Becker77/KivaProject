She began this job after forming the committee of women. She offers her merchandise from her house and also leaves to offer in houses of her friends. It has gone well up to now as it creates an income, which she invests in her house for various things, and now she wants to buy more  items of clothing to have more varieties like T-shirts, dresses, sweaters, pants,  and jeans.

She has taken on various occupations throughout her life, until finally she found the best business for her family. Among the various occupations she has had, the ones she developed the most are agriculture, farming, and catering. She currently sells foods itinerantly. She equips herself with a small awning and with a table and chairs so that her clients can make themselves comfortable while they enjoy the foods which she prepared. Her children help her with her business in attending to the customers. This is how she passes her days: during the morning she sells her foods and in the afternoons she feeds her livestock. But during the harvest season the entire family partakes in the activity to try to collect the products.

She lives in the city of Cartagena and is a married mother of 2 children, aged 20 and 24. Her dream is for them to be successful. 17 years ago, with severance pay from a job she used to have in a business, she began her business activity. First she sold fish, later merchandise. Gradually she gained acceptance and built her clientele. She began to sell ceramic items. She also paints little ceramic cookies, which serve as souvenirs for first communions, children's parties, quincea\u00f1eras, graduations, and decorations. She also paints pictures. All of this activity has allowed her to develop her artistic talent and because of that she feels very happy.

The second location is where Muhsin's sales person mostly sells shoes. Muhsin works for an Italian company called Katri that produces fabric for making clothes. However, his salary at Katri is insufficient for supporting his family. <p>\r\n\r\nHis neighbor recommended that Muhsin apply for a loan at Microinvest in order to expand his business. Now is a season for summer clothes, and Muhsin needs to purchase goods for resale. He hopes to obtain a loan from Kiva via Microinvest in order to expand his business by purchasing seasonal men's and children's clothing.\t<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva

She is married and has a kid. Difficult living conditions forced her husband to leave to earn money in Russia. Mavzuna has been running a grocery store for the past 5 years. Currently, her business is the only source of income for her family of a little child and the parents of her husband. She sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and also detergents in her grocery store. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Mavzuna is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. Mavzuna is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan to increase inventory. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Mavzuna reach all of her aspirations.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For two years, she studied to become a hairstylist.  In order to pursue her course work, Leydi had to awaken at 5:00 in the morning to bring guavas, wildflowers, mushrooms and churros to Zitacuaro to sell from very early in the day at some of the open air markets in the town.   In the afternoons, she worked in a caf\u00e9 that is located outside the institute where she studied. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, her greatest wish is to have the basic products necessary in order to start a hair styling business in her community.  She wants to begin with a simple establishment where she can cut hair, provide hairdos, and repair nails and where people interested in this service, primarily young people who attend school, can get their hair cut in the community.\r\n<p>\r\nLeydi is an independent young woman accustomed to looking after herself because, when she was very small, her parents left her under the care of her grandparents, who were already very old, and now she has the responsibility of caring for them.  Her greatest dream is to have her salon where she can offer her services to the community and from which she can obtain income in order to support herself and her grandparents.\r\n<br

She is 54 years old. Ignacia is widowed and has three grown children. To make a living, Ignacia owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transportation in the local community. Ignacia has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ignacia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ignacia is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In order to meet this objective, she is asking for her first loan, through Edpyme Alternativa, of 1,000 PEN ($375) to buy furniture and utensils.\r\n\r\nFanny is a very hard working and enterprising woman with a high regard for commitment and responsibility.  Her greatest desire is to open a restaurant within the zone.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":505663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Set up a second food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ort\u00edz - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.06},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.04},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.74,"local_amount":127.3,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":135.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934685},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":173.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":184.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662306},{"amount":67.18,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":190.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695010},{"amount":86.71,"local_amount":231.22,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":245.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878055},{"amount":71.7,"local_amount":191.2,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":203,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618083},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":97.2,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":103.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832486}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T02:06:51Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

To prepare her kenkey, she buys maize from the market and soaks it in a lot, or enough, water to soften the maize. She washes it on the third day and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it to prove for the next day. She divides the proved dough into two and uses one half for her firm half-cooked dough. She mixes it with water to get it into a porridge form, cooks it for some time to get a firm mixture or texture of the dough. Then she mixes the rest of the uncooked dough with the half-cooked portion. She moulds into balls and wraps them in corn husk. She cooks them again till they become soft to eat. Kenkey can be eaten with various kinds of sauces such as pepper sauce, with fried or roasted fish, roasted chicken, roasted turkey or any other kind of meat or fish.\r\n\r\nEkua is married to a farmer and has four children.

Ni\u00f1o, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon. She is 53 years old. Flora is widowed and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Flora owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, junk foods, canned goods, biscuits, breads, & detergents in the local community. Flora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Flora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products for sale. Flora is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory for sale and as working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Flora from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Marites is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional supplies for her store. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Marites from ASKI.

She is married and has one daughter. Her husband is employed in a concrete production company with a low salary. Nada wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan of $1,214.07 from FATEN. When Nada gets her FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will purchase new home furniture and that will allow her family to live in better conditions. Nada is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is a person who can talk very comfortably when we comment on his history of success. He was excited knowing we would take the picture. This is why he gave us the interview. \r\n\r\nHe tells us that he is 37 years old and lives in a Mazahua community called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec. He has been married to Guadalupe for 16 years, and together they have 3 children who attend school. Ismael has a shoe store. From the time he was a child, he knew how to sell shoes, since his parents were the founders of the business and of the market where they sell the shoes. Now he has his own business. Although it comes from his parents, Ismael is the one who tends to it and is in charge of it. Ismael is asking for the loan in order to purchase more shoes such as boots, tennis shoes, high heels, sandals, etc. for women, men, girls, and boys. \r\n\r\nHe tells us that the loan will help him a lot since he will be able to invest more in his business and more than anything, the good seasons are coming and he will not have to worry about buying merchandise for a long time. Nevertheless, the difficulty he faces is that many times he doesn't sell and due to lack of money, he cannot invest more in his business.  He also recently got through his wife's illness. He also says that he likes the countryside a lot and had sheep and a field of cactus, although he sold the sheep to cover the costs resulting from the illness of his wife. \r\n\r\nBut Ismael is a very hard-working and responsible person and he has goals, such as to put everything into his shoe business.  He remembers that his shoe sales were once very good, and he would like to sell like before in order to improve the quality of life for his children and wife. He thinks that due to lack of money he will not be able to raise himself up, but he will do everything possible to get himself ahead again. He is a very hard-working family man, and he is very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the support they give him, and he hopes it does not turn out badly.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1105850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase shoes, boots, and tennis shoes for men and women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1349.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1380.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1412.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1445.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1479.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1514.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1549.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1585.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1622.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1660.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":549632,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti aged 40 years, is married and has been blessed with one child who has completed schooling.

He is married and has 3 children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe was forced to flee from northern Uganda to central Uganda due to Joseph Kony's rebel activities in his district. He lives with his family in the displaced persons camp known as Acholi Quarters. There, he earned some money working in the stone quarry.

His loan request was for building a family house in Acholi Quarters on a plot the King of Buganda donated to the Acholi some years back. He did not actually use that loan to build a house in Acholi Quarters, but in his home district of Pader, since the situation in the north is not as alarming as it used to be.

Most recently, she has begun selling rice, sugar, and flour, which have turned out to be her most popular items. She also has a large basket of kumquats, which she grows and picks in her own garden.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (the altituD. ranges from 6,000 to 17,000 feet above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR Virgen D. las Mercedes has its base in the capital of  the province of Churcampa, which is located at over 10,000 feet above sea level. Currently the bank has completed 2 loan cycles in just one year of existence with 17 female borrowers. Some of the group members live in small communities outsiD. the city of Churcampa, in places like El Carmen and Chupas, more than an hour of walking distance away.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank, during their one year in FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, are learning more and more about savings and how to invest their loans. The group was able to save over 5,500 soles (about $1,800) in the first 2 loan cycles and will continue to save in the future.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for the education of their children: buying school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  Another dream they have for the use of their savings is to be able to make renovations to their houses, like constructing another floor or changing the roof to a more sustainable one.\r\n<p>\r\nAll members have different enterprises, ranging from raising guinea pigs, having a kiosk with sweets and juices close to the primary school, selling food and ice creams, buying and selling small animals, selling potatoes, selling chicken or having grocery stores.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery member has a different testimony, as is the case of 36-year-old Mary O. C., who has a small grocery store in the central square of Churcampa, where she also sells homemaD. sweets. As with many women, she has more than one occupation: she also buys and sells chicken. The chicken she buys in a major city that is more than 8 hours away by public transport. Her dream is to grow her business and keep on saving to be able to pay for the education of her 3 children. Her new loan she will use for buying more groceries for her store.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother story is the one of Edith A. G., who has a grocery store and buys and sells small animals like sheep and lamb. Those are the businesses she runs during the whole year, but living in a rural area, she also has fields of corn and is waiting for the harvest in May to be able to sell her corn. Her new loan she will invest in buying more small animals.\r\n<p>\r\nAs the women of the group have different businesses, different businesses require different loans. The loans range from 200 soles, 400 soles, and 600 soles up to 1200 soles, and the total of the loans reaches 8,900 soles among the 17 members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":116625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"As the women of the group have different businesses, different businesses require different loans.

Moreover with the tight economic condition deteriorating and her 2 children still young made Ayu Putu decide to be diligent in pig farming which has been a family tradition since generations.  Her husband\u2019s income as a farmer is felt to be not sufficient to provide for the family\u2019s expenses.  With the motivation to assist her husband Ayu Putu decided to borrow from DINARI through the KIVA program to increase her capital to fund her pig farming.  With the initial loan 4 breeding pigs Ayu once again purchase 5 pigs with the loan from DINARI.  Coincidentally, Ayu\u2019s pig pen are adequately permanent adequate to accommodate many pigs.  Ayu is very serious in the pig farming because income from the sale is large.  After 5 months of breeding usually result in income of Rp.500.000,- (about USD 54) each month.  This will definitely aid fulfilling the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nMeski masih berusia muda untuk seorang ibu rumah tangga, tidak membuat Ayu Putu bersantai-santai dengan kehidupannya. Apalagi dengan himpitan ekonomi yang semakin berat dan ditambah harus menghidupi kedua anaknya yang masih kecil-kecil membuat Ayu Putu memutuskan untuk menekuni usahanya sebagai peternak babi yang memang sudah digeluti oleh keluarganya secara turun temurun. Penghasilan suaminya yang seorang petani dirasa masih belum cukup memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya. Dengan motivasi membantu suaminya inilah Ayu Putu memutuskan untuk meminjam ke DINARI melalui program KIVA sehingga modalnya akan bertambah untuk usaha ternak babinya. Dengan modal awal 4 ekor babi penggemukan Ayu kembali membeli 5 ekor lagi dengan menggunakan modal dari DINARI. Kebetulan kandang babi Ayu sudah cukup permanen sehingga mampu menampung banyak babi. Ayu memang sangat serius menekuni usaha ternak babinya karena keuntungan yang didapat cukup besar dari hasil penjualannya. Selama 5 bulan pemeliharaan nantinya diharapkan bisa mendatangkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.000,- setiap bulannya. Tentunya hal ini akan sangat membantu memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":191395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase piglets and supplies (Membeli anak babi dan pakannya)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T12:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ayu Putu Astiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T18:11:45Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":836363.64,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T01:53:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":849097.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351701},{"amount":91.33,"local_amount":830303.02,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":842944.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308542},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1692041.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849765},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1692041.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080602}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T18:11:45Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64871,"name":"Maria Fabiola","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria Fabiola V., tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera tiene un hijo de 8 a\u00f1os de edad que cursa el tercer grado de primaria, no tiene ayuda economica del papa de su hijo, la actividad economica de la s\u00f1ora es la comecializacion de cosmeticos como perfumes para hombres y mujeres y ropa variada como pantalones, blusas trajes, actividad que tiene seis a\u00f1os  de desarrollar la cual da inicio como una alternativa al desempleo y aprovechando el apoyo de un familiar en el exterior ha ido creciendo poco a poco en capital, siendo su sue\u00f1o poder instalar un tiene de ropa para ni\u00f1os y adultos, y su proposito poder satisfacer la demanda, y darle un mejor porvenir a su hijo.","en":"Mrs. Maria Fabiola V., is 31 years of age, is a single mother of an 8 year old child who attends the third grade.

He raises and sells cattle because in that area there is hardly any other work for either men or women.  His wife is a housewife.  She manages the home and looks after the children.  One son is a migrant worker who works in Russia. Abdullo's daughter-in-law lives with them and cares for their grandchild.  Their family is large, 14 people who all live in the same house.  They would like to set up separate households, and therefore must increase the size of their herd in order to be able to divide it amongst the sons.

","en":"Delphine F. was born in 1978 in Cotonou, Benin's economic capital.  Delphine is married to Robert Gbetchou and the mother of four school-aged children. Delphine and her husband and children have been living in the Agbato quarter of Cotonou for the last five years. She helps her husband meet their family's needs with the income generated from her business. Delphine never attended school.

Her business involves designing handbags and shoes that she then has made and promotes through her specialized catalog.  \r\n\r\nIt has been 2 years since she entered into the arena that she prepared for, and started her own line of sandals and shoes.  She currently distributes these in the city of Barranquilla, in the Atl\u00e1ntico department, Valledupar, and the Codazzi municipality in the Cesar department.  This is how, with the help of trusted family and friends, she traveled to Bogot\u00e1 in September of 2009 to live with her sister.  Since that instance, she started selling bags and shoes by catalog from her own line called \u201cLinA.\u201d, with good results.  Her business includes the design, distribution and sale of footwear.  Currently, she is requesting her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, as she would like greater access to her markets.  She needs to buy a greater quantity of raw materials, especially leather, in order to make the handbags and shoes in her new collection.  \r\n\r\nLina is a young woman who dreams of growing as a professional and entrepreneur in order to help her family.  In addition, she would like to have her own workshop and shoe stores staffed by employees.

She earns her living buying and selling fresh\/dried fish. Her husband Julius, who is 33 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have two children who are 8 and 9 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to continue to save up for future expansion of her business and to send her children to school. Rowena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Before joining One Acre Fund, David was only able to harvest 3 \u00bd bags of maize on \u00bd acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to David and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, David will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Wekhoyela group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nDavid and the group members appear in the photograph as shown. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":925019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bonface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62650,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":62650,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63770,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680929}],"funded_date":"2011-11-24T21:53:18Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":364874,"name":"Rino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rino is 29 years old and lives in the town of Trinidad, Bohol.

X..  I`m 43 years old and I sell comales [clay dishes for making tortillas] and clay pots of all sizes.  I live in San Raymundo, and since I was little I made comales since that is one of the most common activities.  When I married and had kids (now 6 children in all), only making comales was no longer profitable since I had to sell them here in my pueblo and people didn\u00b4t pay much for them.  So 15 years ago I decided to commercialize my products in other places.  We currently go to Taxisco, Chiquimulilla, Pasaco, Sipacate--all on Guatemala\u00b4s coast.  <p> Now I\u00b4m a wholesaler.  I buy the products from people in my pueblo and I have clients who order large quantities of comales and pots.  I need more capital to invest and I want to take advantage of this season, when everyone is making comales.  If I buy now, then I can have my products stored before winter begins.  I want to sell my products in other towns and also I\u00b4d like to hire two people who will work full time making comales so I can cover orders during the winter months. <p>\r\nI work hard so my children can continue in school.

Vivo en San Raymundo, desde peque\u00f1a me dedicaba a la elaboraci\u00f3n de comales, ya que en este municipio es una de las actividades m\u00e0s comunes, al formar mi hogar con mi esposo y al tener mis hijos que son 6 en total, ya solo elaborar comales no era tan rentable ya que los tenia que vender aqu\u00ed mismo en el pueblo y las personas no pagaban mucho por ellos, hace ya  15 a\u00f1os que decid\u00ed   salir a comerciar con mi producto a otros lugares, actualmente vamos a los municipios de Taxisco, Chiquimulilla, Pasaco, Sipacate que est\u00e1n en la costa de Guatemala.  Ahora ya soy mayorista le compro su producto a las personas del pueblo y caserios cercanos, tengo clientes que me hacen  pedidos grandes de comales y ollas, por eso necesito m\u00e1s capital para invertir ya quiero aprovechar que es el tiempo en que la gente produce bastantes comales y que al comprarlos pueda tener almacenado mi mercader\u00eda antes que inicie el invierno.  Quiero visitar otros municipios para ofrecer mi producto y tambien contratar a dos personas para que me trabajen fijo y comprar material para elaborar comales, ya que esto me ayudar\u00e1 a poder cubrir los pedidos durante los meses de invierno, siempre trabajo muy duro para que mis hijos sigan estudian ya que 4 de ellos esta en diferentes grados y que puedan graduarse y tener una carrera para

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Lavalea has been engaged in this business for over 4 years.\n\nLavalea joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lavalea has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Lavalea is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lavalea plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Since then, in the planting and harvest seasons he needs workers, but during the school vacations, between January and March, he receives the help of his children.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9000, thereby uplifting the family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 as additional capital for business, for her children's education and to continue to save up for future home repairs. Maria Natividad R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":550069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: soft drinks, livestock and a general store. Her husband Alejandro, who is 53 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 8 to 26 years old. Sergia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sergia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to buy soft drinks. She also has an inventory of livestock so that she can continue to save up for future education and renovation of her house. Sergia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She lives and has her business in Ciudadela 20 de Julio which is a neighborhood where commercial and residential areas mix.  It is also the home to sporting and recreational grounds, the most important of which is the city of Barranquilla's Estadio Metropolitano where Colombia's professional teams play soccer.  Soccer is a sport that unites the whole country but especially the people who live in the warm city of Barranquilla and on the north coast of Colombia.\r\n\r\nRosa Luz started her dressmaking business in 2001 although her experience in this art dates back to 1977.  Over time, she has perfected her techniques.  She makes good-quality clothes and, for this reason, she has loyal customers which is important because Rosa's greatest challenge in her business is the competition who make inroads into the trade with short-lasting prices and products.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's first loan and she needs it to buy fabrics, thread, lace and buttons in large quantities so that she can obtain special discounts.  Rosa's fixed business assets are a sewing machine, an overlock sewing machine and various tools which are all located on the second floor of her home.  Rosa's main customers are people who have traditionally been served by her: neighbors and family members.  She offers her products for cash or on credit.\r\n\r\nRosa Luz works with one of her five children in her small business and her goal for the future is to acquire an industrial sewing machine so that she can improve her production times and the quality of her business.  This will enable her to improve her income and productivity and, as a result, her family's quality of life.

Owner and founder, Meiko, worked diligently for several months perfecting an old family sugar cookie and turtle cookie recipe.  After completing her final product, Meiko began sharing her sweet creations with family and friends, and received an overwhelmingly positive response.  Word spread of Meiko\u2019s delicious delicacies and people began placing orders for all types of parties, celebrations, and other functions.  One business owner was so impressed with Meiko\u2019s cookies, that he ordered 115 dozen to be shipped across the United States as gifts for his clients.  Needless to say, Meiko quickly outgrew the home and needed to move into a commercial building to support her rapidly growing business.\r\n\r\nToday, One Smart Cookie Company has a total of 11 employees operating three locations and has expanded their product line to include deli sandwiches and catering services.  In the future, Meiko would love to franchise the company to provide her product to a larger target market. \r\n\r\nMeiko will use her Kiva loan to purchase baking supplies and signage for a new

los gastos que genera su hogar, donde convive con su esposo y sus 3 hijos, decidi\u00f3 iniciar un negocio en el cual pueda estar al cuidado de las obligaciones del hogar y al mismo tiempo a la atenci\u00f3n de su negocio. Marivi se decida a la venta de fresas con chocolate, y otras presentaciones con chocolate fundido, actividad que aprendi\u00f3 cuando conoci\u00f3 la m\u00e1quina para fundir chocolate e inmediatamente vio una oportunidad de negocio. Esta actividad la inici\u00f3 hace aproximadamente 3 a\u00f1os, y gracias a su buena atenci\u00f3n y la calidad de sus productos, es muy reconocida en su regi\u00f3n.

Paul is an extraordinary farmer.  He comes from the South Rift region of Kenya, where dairy farming is a booming business.  Most, if not all, farmers there own dairy animals.  Most farmers keep traditional cattle breeds for subsistence, and a number of farmers have graduated into commercial farming by replacing the grotesque, unproductive, traditional breeds with higher grade cows.  However, only a handful of visionary farmers have taken the big gamble of investing in pedigree breeds. \r\n\r\nPaul, a father of 3, has been dairy farming for the last 12 years and is very passionate about the dairy business.  His passion drives his work as he strives to push himself up to a mastery level of dairy farming.  Throughout the years, he has observed that most dairy farmers are in the business because they were born in to families that are dairy farmers, or because everyone  else is dairy farming.  This mindset builds contentment and the kind of humility that kills any hope of progress.  For people like Paul, constant progress and adding value makes the world go round.  He uses every opportunity to learn more and keeps company with the best.\r\n\r\nPaul is seeking a loan of 200,000 KES to buy a pedigree dairy cow.  Venturing down that route is by no means an easy option though, and it requires an  investment of both time and money.  But, Paul is ambitious and not afraid to invest in the future.  While other farmers may only have the ability to increase production, Paul can also sell good genetics, making this path worthwhile.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Paul is going to make a big difference.  Through Juhudi Kilimo, he has been able to attend numerous training programs.  He has solid knowledge on: Feeding the Dairy Cow; Improving Herd Fertility; Good Agricultural and Environmental Practice; Improving Herd Health; Record Keeping.\r\nThe money Paul will make from this investment will help him to comfortably afford other farm expenses.  Improving his dairy business will bring untold benefits to his family.  Paul's priorities include paying for food, paying for his children's education, and building up his savings account."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1690149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is a breeder who raises pig and she also is a farmer. Since breeding pig is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets for her breeding. Her husband, Mr. Ngaet Vai, is a laborer who can earn a little money to support the family. Mrs. Pov E. is 44 years old and the mother of three children who are all attending the local school.\n\nFour members in this village bank loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

S. is 64 years old and lives in the town of Mallco Chapi, about 21 kilometers from the city of Cochabamba.  Braulio has been married for more than 36 years and they have three children who are 26, 22, and 19.  The younger two live with them and along with helping care for the cows, also study at a technical school in the city of Cochabamba.  Braulio has worked in fresh milk production for more than 20 years, and also farms different crops on his land.  At his home he has 5 dairy cows, and they are his main source of income.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan will be used to buy food for the dairy cows, since the price has increased from lack of rain.  In this way he can feed his livestock the normal amount and their milk production and his earnings will not be affected.  The loan will also be used to pay for his share of the water well that they are building in the area to irrigate his land.\r\n<p>\r\nBraulio tells us that his biggest dream is to provide every comfort for his wife and children, since their house does not currently have many luxuries or necessary utilities.  He also tells us that with the next loan he gets, he would like to build a house for his children, so that they can live more comfortably.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":467613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy food for dairy cows and to help pay for a well ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T20:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Braulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128928961},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872739},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093382},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657763},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262010},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479194},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T07:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232769996},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744458}],"funded_date":"2010-01-12T22:52:11Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":171730,"name":"Zeinab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zeinab is a 29 years old and lives in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maria started her business three years ago, making and selling salchipapas (a local hotdog-like dish), by setting up a table outside the door of her house.  Whenever there was an event going on in the neighborood, she made the most of it to increase her sales.  After a time, one of her sons began studying pastry-making so she set up a stand to display her son's pastries.\r\n\r\nSra. Maria believes this business will be much more profitable and provide her a way to pay for her children to go to school.  She is also supporting a niece who is in her care.  Her next goal is to start a restaurant.  She wants to set the restaurant up in a space at her house so that she can avoid paying rent.\r\n\r\nSra.

With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Hermocilla has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,800, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of children. Hermocilla is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a married woman and she has 3 children, aged 26 and 34. She lives in Costa Hermosa in a community within the municipality of Soledad. She sells a variety of merchandise. Betty's first business was a sewing business where she made girls' dresses, bed sheets, and sweaters. In 2005 she started selling shoes made by her brother and later she sold ladies' handbags, comforters, and ladies' accessories. As Betty's business grew her enthusiasm also increased and still today there is no stopping her. This is how she has earned herself good clients. But she still doesn't have a larger working capital to respond to them in an opportune way. Her son is involved in her business. He purchases the merchandise and this is a great help. She later distributes among her very diverse clientele. Her Kiva loan is her second with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). This organization has supported the growth of her working capital. Her dream is to have a general store in her house, to take a rest from having to distribute client by client. She will be able to have all that her clients need and she will be able to diversify whenever the market requires it. With her Kiva loan she will purchase ladies' handbags, sandals, ladies' shoes in general, pants, hats, jeans, fashion jewelry, and accessories. She conducts her business by taking orders, which guarantees success in the rotation of inventory among her important clients to ensure a quick recovery of her capital

So, nowadays she does not allow credit because it prevents her from reinvesting her income to make her business grow.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping that she could continually acquire financial assistance from the lending institution, so that she could improve her financial stability and improve her family\u2019s living conditions. Through this loan amount, she could attain her goal in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":925067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

business driving a taxi. She has many years of experience in this business. Penelope needs a loan of WST 1,000 to maintain her vehicle. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be WST 500 or USD 208 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Penelope joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Penelope's first loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":932929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

Mr. Khut K. is 26 years old and the father of a four year old child who is too young to work or attend school.  Mr. Phon S. and Mr. Chea P. could not come to take the loan but their wives came to take the loan instead so they are in the picture. \r\n\r\nTwelve members have end-of-term loans and these members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 54 years old, a widow, and the mother of 8 children who range in age from 28 to 18 years old.  Of these, she has two sets of twins: one pair that is 26 years old and one pair that is 24 years old.  The youngest go to school.  She only went to school through the 1st grade because her parents wouldn't let her continue.  She lives in her own home with her children and even helps her sister and 4 nieces and nephews with family support.\r\n\r\nShe left Sofala for Maputo, Boane District with her now deceased husband when he was still a soldier.  They made their home in Boane and later, her husband lost his life.  She began agricultural work in order to support her children.  She learned about this work with her parents when she was still in Sofala.  She receives the pension of her deceased husband, which has a value of 4,000 MZN.  1,500 of the aid given for her children goes toward household expenses.  She even manages to save some monthly in her bank account and in Xiqitue (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe never has had loans through banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 4th loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  With it, she plans to buy construction materials (beams, panes, cement, sand, and windows) in order to continue with the construction of her house.  The previous loans had values of 8,500 MZN, 13,000 MZN, and 13,000 MZN.  All were for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to ask for more loans in order to continue with the construction of her home and to provide better living conditions for her family.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

He raises calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has two children to support and give a proper education. Mahamatrasul has improved his financial situation by wisely using the loans he has received from IMON International to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer dairy products in his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.
