Kholiyar works hard to cultivate his crops, such as potatoes, carrots, onions, and other vegetables. He works from early morning till late at night, hoping to have a rich harvest. Kholiyar sells his produce in the market where it is always in high demand due to its good quality. He also raises cattle. His work fills him with great optimism and allows him to help his beloved children. His goal is to improve the quality of his agricultural products even more and grow his business. Kholiyar has a large and friendly family who are all always trying to help each other. Today Kholiyar requests a loan of 2500 Somoni (US $725) for the term of 9 months to buy fertilizer and also calves.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and Hands (Makis): so the name translates as \"Golden Hands\".  This group consists of 13 members, from the southern area of the town of Cusco.  The members work in different areas. Four are artisans working with clay, wood, leather and other materials.  Another three members are retail merchants who buy and sell potatoes in the central market.  Another two members work buying clothes wholesale in the capital and bringing them to Cusco to sell.  Another two members have a small stationary shop and buy school equipment to sell in their area: in two more weeks' time the school term will start in Peru's different schools.  \r\n\r\nThe small businesses in which these members have invested provide the money to pay school fees and other personal expenses.  The members are very grateful for the support lent through this means and promise to promptly repay the entire loan within the agreed time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":283612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase raw materials for artesanal activities,clothes to sell and general school materials.

Shuhrat is a young guy who wishes to improve his business to be able to support his family and offer them a better quality of life. Four years ago, Shuhrat started selling car spare parts. His business has grown little by little; he now offers a variety of products. His starting capital was $1000 US from his savings. Today, Shuhrat has been working with IMON International for more than a year, and feels very satisfied with the support offered to him, because it has allowed him to increase his business, satisfy the needs of his customers and support his family. \r\n<p>\r\nShuhrat applied for a loan of $2400 US in order to purchase new goods for his store. He wants to develop his business and increase his income to save money and create a better life for his family.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has five sons and one daughter.  Her oldest son lives and works in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city; her two middle sons live with their father in the countryside; and her two youngest sons and daughter are students at local schools.  <p>\r\n\r\nM. operates a small boot-making and boot-repair business in her town.  She makes durable boots, which she trades with herders in the surrounding countryside.  As many herders do not have cash to purchase new boots, she trades her products for a variety of dairy products and animals.  She then sells these dairy products at the local market in her town for a profit.  Her husband and two of her sons live and raise the animals they acquire in the countryside.  The family uses the animals for meat and furs. <p> \r\n\r\nM. started her business in 2008 yet she has quickly found success.  Indeed, her business has enabled her to maintain both of her family's homes and to ensure that her family has a high standard of living.  M. is a very hard-working, sociable, and business-minded person.  She always looks for ways to increase her earnings and to improve her business.  For instance, she explains that, last summer, she experimented by starting a retail grocery business, which was quite profitable.  She notes that she will continue to produce boots in the hope that one of her children can start a grocery business in the future.  In this way, she is trying to do many things in order to provide for her children.  M. is requesting a loan in the amount of 500,000 tugrug (approximately $375 USD) to purchase materials such as felt boots, leather, and rubber for her boot-making business. <p>\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001 and listed its first Kiva loan in January 2009.  It is the largest micro-finance organization in Mongolia, but it also has mainstream commercial operations.

They generally live in polygamous families in Ouayerma II, one of the districts of Sikasso, the third largest administrative region in Mali. \r\nThis is the second project that they have undertaken with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance organisation in order to meet their customers' needs; their first loan was repaid successfully. \r\nThey sell rugs, children's clothes, firewood, beauty products, natural pharmaceutical products, etc. With their new loan they intend to buy a cartload of firewood, 6 mid-sized rugs and 4 dozen lots of children's clothes. They source their products from the Sikasso town market and neighbouring villages. \r\nThey sell their goods from market stalls at Ouayerma II and through mobile sales in town and at home. Sales are cash- and sometimes credit-based, and their customer base is made up of both men and women. \r\nThe women envisage generating an average monthly profit of 20,500 FCFA; some of this would be saved or spent on family needs, and the rest would be reinvested in the business. \r\nThey aim to ask for more funds in order to equip their store and to satisfy the demands of their customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":451881,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase various items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-16T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152476},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991316},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021591},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746381},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778922},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51278.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961137}],"funded_date":"2010-01-03T01:00:21Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":167633,"name":"Lucinda Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Lucinda, inicia su ciclo 13  con  19 socias. \n\nLas socias realizan diferentes negocios como L. venta D. cereales, le\u00f1a, verduras, calzados, panes, golosinas, cosm\u00e9ticos, abarrotes en general, comida, combustibles, materiales D. construcci\u00f3n.\n\nComo es el caso D.

His wife helps him make the bread and other pastries which they sell in the bakery.\r\n\r\nWith his loan he would like to buy flour, butter and sugar for his business.  In the future he wishes to continue with his bakery but also expand it and be able to add another level to his house for his four children who are 13, 10, 6 and 4 years old."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":625441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Flour,

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating motorcycle transport in the local community. Richard has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Richard joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Richard has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair the existing vehicle for better service. Richard is requesting a new loan of 16000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Richard from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a very hard-working woman who lives in the famous city of Nazca, Peru. This city is famous for the legendary Nazca Lines, a series of ancient, immense and inexplicable hieroglyphics carved into the desert which surrounds the city. They are generally attributed to the people of the Nazca culture, who inhabited the region from 300 to 800 AD. Because of this, the city attracts a large number of tourists. However, Nazca is also known for its hard-working people, who have survived in spite of frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and a high poverty rate in the region. Marleny is a mother with 4 children, aged 17, 15, 12 and 3. The three older children are currently in secondary school, and the youngest does not go to school yet, but he is very mischievous; she says that \"le saca canas verdes\" [he gives her green hairs instead of gray hairs].\r\n\r\nMarleny is currently running a business selling breakfasts, beverages and raspadillas (shaved ice with added sweet fruit-based syrups). She works at her business 8 hours each day, and in one day she might make 50 Peruvian soles, or on a very good day up to 100 soles. She was inspired to open this type of business because she wanted to work at home, so she could watch over her children, especially the youngest. \r\n\r\nMarleny is very grateful for the support provided by the Kiva lenders, since thanks to this help, she will be able to buy supplies (groceries, vegetables, etc.) to expand her business by offering food in the evenings. With this improvement, she will be able to obtain a better income, offer a greater variety of products, and attract more customers. With this she will have better earnings and be able to save up to fulfill her great dream: having her own restaurant.

Mrs. Srey Mao S. is 37 years old widow with two children, one of whom is a seller while another is attending the local school. \nFour members in this group loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans.

End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She wants to provide her children with a decent life. In 2000, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to have access to capital for the maintenance of her businesses. Her previous loans from ASHI were carefully utilized as additional rolling working capital for her tricycle (three-wheeled-vehicle) transport business and for operating a passenger jeepney (a small bus). The businesses are a big help for the family in covering their expenses and allow them to set aside savings for the future.

business. She lives in the Kanggapas zone of barangay Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. \n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her oyster farming business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,500. \n\nMinife is now borrowing PHP 14,000 so that she can buy materials that she needs to sustain her oyster farm such as oyster shells, bamboo and straps. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom.  Minife aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF:  \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

With the loan she financed and sustained her handicraft business, which has been in increasing demand. She is so thankful for your support and the opportunity to borrow money from Kiva. She is very happy that, with the loan, she has been able to provide satisfactory services without delay to her regular customers. She now wishes to access a larger loan to expand her handicraft business and earn more profits. Encarnacion thanks Kiva for providing her with the opportunity to increase her income. Your support is important to her family and they are very grateful.\r\n\r\nEncarnacion joined Kiva partner ASHI to follow her dream of providing her family with a decent life. Prior to joining ASHI, Encarnacion had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams, but she got her first loan from ASHI and started her own business weaving sleeping mats using panan (a kind of palm) leaf. As she continued to get loans from ASHI and save some of her profits, she was able to grow her business. Now she makes other kinds of handicrafts, such as native bags from abaka (banana leaf) fiber, hats, placemats made from twigs, and other home decorations. Many souvenir shop owners visit Encarnacion's village to purchase her products. Other customers are tourists and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) wanting to buy presents for their colleagues abroad. Encarnacion has noticed that her monthly income has almost doubled since receiving her first loan, because she has attracted new customers with her additional inventory. \r\n\r\nNow she is seeking another Kiva loan of 28,000 PHP to maintain her business and purchase more of the raw materials needed for her handicrafts.

She is married to Flaviano O., a painter\/maintenance man, and is the mother of three children. One of her children is already working while one is currently enrolled in college and the other is still in high school. By the grace of God, Marivic has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Marivic, who herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n<br>Marivic is currently concentrating on her buying and selling business. She buys general merchandise from wholesalers and sells it piecemeal to make a little profit. Her products range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, food supplements and other products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Marivic is requesting a loan of 12,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to expand her product inventory by purchasing more products and a greater variety. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Marivic dreams of being able to give her all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Evans will buy land and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of St Monicah group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":925164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T06:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simoni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stelah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wanjala","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":54600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":54600,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":54660,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680935}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T00:33:19Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":364947,"name":"Safia Bibi's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Safia Bibi is a 46-year-old woman.

gustar\u00eda que sus productos sean exportados al extranjeros para considerar la calidad de su trabajo ya que todo lo que a logrado ha sido por que es una mujer luchadora y trabajadora.\n\nSu

C. is 60 years old.  She has a 20-year old son who is in school and helps her with her business.  Her goal is to maintain her business so that she can continue providing her family with a source of income.  Like everyone eager to get ahead, she works hard in order to help both herself and her family.  Her greatest hope is that her son will establish his own business so that he can gain experience and confront the problems that he will have to face in business, something that will help him all his life.  Ana's hope for herself is that people outside her country will appreciate her embroidery work, part of which is machine-made and part hand-made.  She would like her products to be exported abroad so that foreigners can appreciate the quality of her work.  She wants them to know that she's succeeded because she's a strong and hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nAna makes a living as a seamstress, making and selling clothes, and as a baker, making and selling baked goods.  She operates the businesses from her house near the San Jose church.  She started in business 30 years ago when she was abandoned by her partner after the birth of her son and faced the everyday challenge of feeding both herself and her baby.  Despite the difficulties, her family took her in and, with their help, she was able to start a business, offering her sewing skills to family and friends.  She also entered into a bakery apprenticeship, work that she turned to in order to supplement her earnings from her sewing business.  She's managed to maintain both businesses, something that was especially hard for her because like most Nicaraguan women she's suffered from breast cancer.  Despite her illness, she had to work because her businesses were her only source of income.  Her faith and her love for her son sustained her while she was ill but the medicine that she had to buy exhausted her capital.  She's applying for a loan to recapitalize her business and buy the basic materials she needs for her sewing and pastry businesses.

This is 26-year-old Isabela C. F. from Dar es Salaam. She is single and she is supporting two dependants whose parents are not able to take care of them. Isabela has been running a bead and necklace business since 2004. Beads are small rounded pieces of glass, stone or plastic which are perforated and threaded on a string with others to make a necklace or rosary.<br>\r\nShe works at the business for 5 to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by ten people. Isabela currently earns about $143 US from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stock of beads and necklaces. For the future, she plans to to establish a new business.<br>\r\nIsabela thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":304007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Su-ay, in the City of Himamaylan Negros Occidental. She is 47 years old and married to Rodolfo M., a Provincial Government employee. They have 12 children - the oldest is 27 years old and the youngest is only three. Most of their children are still in school. Even with such a big family to feed and raise, Leonida is contented with her life, determined to take care of her children and prepare them to face life once they're all grown up. She is indefatigable in her role as mother and wife.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband increase their income and set aside some money for their future security, Leonida set up a general store. When she started, she only had a little capital so she just carried the most basic household commodities that were in demand in her neighborhood. She decided not to sell food or candies in her store because she knew that her children would not be able to resist eating them, diminishing their income. For several years, she continued to just rollover her capital, earning a very small income. While it helped with their family expenses, her store was not expanding. She joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 to gain access to additional income so that she could finally expand her business. \r\n\r\nAs her income continued to improve, she was able to pay off her loans on time and maintain a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. Later, Leonida invested in a backyard hog-fattening project, which allowed her to involve her children in an income-generating activity by letting them take care of the pigs as part of their daily chores.  She has been operating her general store for 19 years now and she testifies that her continuing success is because she is dedicated, works hard, perseveres and is disciplined in her pursuit. This has improved the quality of life of her family. She presently earns PHP 6,000 average monthly profit from her business and it helps to pay for the family expenses, allows her to afford sending her children to school, and contributes to making their life more comfortable than before. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 18,000 was used to add to her working capital. She paid all of her weekly installments on time and the loan was paid in full within its loan term. Now she is borrowing PHP 15,000 for her 16th loan cycle, again to invest in the expansion of her product offerings in her general store. She intends to use the income from this loan to do some house repair, pay for the tuition of her children and provide them with their daily allowance. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":390576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

becomes stable in order for her to have a steady source of income to support the education of her two adopted children until they graduate from college and have their own career. With the support of her husband, Rosemarie did not have any problems paying the loan she received.  However, she had problems maintaining her business because her profit is insufficient to cover the cost of her family expenses. Therefore, she has to spend some of the money that is meant for business capital. Thus, Rosemarie is requesting a much larger loan and is excited to see her business grow by having a huge amount of capital. Furthermore, she hopes that someday their lives will improve and her business will gain more customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":513909,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing motorcycle transport in the local community. Jenny is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jenny joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 10,000 PHP will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the fourth loan that Jenny has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas.

The loan will be used to buy more cosmetic  body lotions and will help Monica to generate greater profits and pay school fees for herself. Monica hopes that in the future she will be able to become a doctor. \r\n\r\nMonica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Ibanda seem minimal. It takes lots of enterprise, conviction, and credible ideas outside of the conventional box. This reality dawned on Benard a decade ago as he set forth in the aforementioned trade. A steady and satisfactory trajectory has been formidable to sustain and consolidate, but, nevertheless, Benard has made inroads. His kind of business would do really well in a metropolis like Kampala or Jinja, but Benard is undeterred.\r\n\r\nHe has been able to get into the good graces of those he has served, and, as such, has carved out his own niche. His clientele base is not so big if parallels are drawn with other entrepreneurs engaged in the same trade in places like Mbarara--fast becoming Western Uganda's commercial city. That, however, does not unnerve him. He is upbeat about the future prospects of his business, and he believes this Kiva loan will come in handy in his drive to open new horizons for his trade.\r\n\r\nBenard, a lusty widower with four children, says he began his business with income from his crude alcohol sales business. Thus far, his business's sales returns total 500,000 Ugandan shillings. Benard also ekes out supplementary income from a modest food sales business.

Mary Prah, her mother, helps her because Jameratu had to go to the hospital for treatment for a minor illness (Mary is in the picture). \r\n<p>\r\nJameratu owns and operates a grocery shop in one of the busy local markets.

Samak\u00e9, age 37, is the father of three children and lives with his wife and children in a monogamous family in the Dougounina district of the city of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Not having attended school, he soon began working to earn a living.  Before running a business buying and selling electronics that he learned from his brother, he was a village farmer for ten years.  With three years of experience, he has a good command of his commercial business and is well-known by his customers, who are growing in number. \r\n\r\nIn his search for supplemental financial resources, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and is on his first individual loan for buying electronics (lamps, flashlights, radios...)  Supplies are gotten from wholesalers in Bamako (capital of Mali), and sales are made locally in Bougouni to customers composed of local people and fair vendors from surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he intends to realize a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan interest payments and to provide for his family.  In the years to come, he envisions expanding his shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":322949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy electronic goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saibou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020279},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243035},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678860},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112645},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028212},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873549},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763288},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152091},{"amount":69.48,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991016}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T12:55:32Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":114142,"name":"\u0110\u1eb7ng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb T.

She is very optimistic that her business will grow and wishes to earn a better income for her family.\r\n\r\nMarilou said that she likes the services of CEVI because they give the lowest interest rate, which is 2% a month and is very affordable to repay.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":383001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy piglets and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Surallah, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.366667 124.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2009-09-05T15:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8524.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118059934}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T18:37:45Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:09:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":138771,"name":"Chantal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chantal U. is 46 years old, is married with five children, and she takes care of eight dependents.\r\n\r\nChantal has been in the business of selling clothes for fiive years, working ten hours a day, but her monthly earnings are still low.

M. is thirty years old, married, and has two sons aged nine years old and four years old. His business is located in Thika town. Thika is the region in Kenya known for its production of pineapples. He has been selling fruit such as bananas, water melon, oranges, apples, mangoes, avocados, paw paws and pineapples for the last three years to the local people. He also supplies fruits to other fruit vendors in the area. \r\n\r\nBenson says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are other people in the area doing the same business as his and so customers are not very loyal as they are spoilt for choice. However he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy more fruits to expand his business. He hopes to expand his business to wholesale, open up a food processing plant and become the manager. He describes himself as charismatic, hard-working and

She lives with her husband and two children in their own house. For more than twenty years, she has been producing artisan embroideries and items of clothing typical to the area. From the comfort of her own home, she splits her time between carrying out the domestic tasks and spending time on this artisan craft. During the festive seasons, between June and July, the demand for these embroideries increases, along with her income. She enjoys her work very much; for her it is a hobby and allows her to demonstrate her ability to make good use of colours in her embroideries. She therefore does not intend to stop working and wants to progress further and further with her business. This is her ninth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has a means of financial support as she has always proved to be responsible with her payments. She is also grateful to be part of her communal group because all of its members are responsible and supportive people. She will invest the loan requested in the purchase of materials such as threads and fabrics to continue her embroidery.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Stansfield, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":565623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabrics and threads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-10T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":218.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":233.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":244.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":256.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":267.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":279.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":218.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":226.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673554},{"amount":85.59,"local_amount":233.44,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":241.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887373},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":244.31,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":252.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154384},{"amount":94.2,"local_amount":256.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":265.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449679},{"amount":98.13,"local_amount":267.62,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":277.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588388},{"amount":102.32,"local_amount":279.06,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":288.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724874}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T16:55:11Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Stansfield","image":null}},{"id":217422,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luz joined ASHI in 2005; aiming to get out of the spiral of poverty, and consistently acquire working capital for her \"sari-sari\" (variety) store and food vending ventures.

He started this business 7 years ago with a small number of livestock. But as his business has developed, he has acquired greater quantities of animals for their eventual sale and gain from their derivatives. According to Muminjon, he works very hard so that he can support his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve the living of his family. Currently Muminjon needs a loan of 2,300 USD in order to purchase more cattle and later resell after breeding them. This will allow him to fully meet the needs of his family and educate all of his children.    \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has 14 members, men and women.  This communal bank is dedicated to short cycle corn, orange and cocoa bean farming.\r\n\r\nFabiola is a corn, orange and cocoa bean farmer.  Her purchases and her sales take place in Chillanes Canton.  She\u2019s asking for the loan to buy seeds and farming supplies like urea, Matamonte [herbicide], fertilizer and weed killer to maintain her crops in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be very helpful because she\u2019ll be able to improve her quality of life.

M. y M., 39 years old, makes and sells hand woven mats. These traditional mats are used as beds or as a place to sit. Berta learned this age-old tradition from her mom. and believes it is important to pass on the art to her children. She dedicates her time to creating the mats and can produce up to a few dozen per week if that's all she's working on. Her children help with the weaving, and Berta is pleased to have money and not be dependent on her husband's meager earnings.\r\n<p>\r\nBerta is married and lives with her husband, who works in the fields.

Her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, five days per week and is assisted by one employee. Salma currently earns about 300 USD from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":212540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of stationary","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T01:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T09:34:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348063},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970646},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886863},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436123},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130396}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T09:34:09Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73198,"name":"Rosa Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d, ubicado en el Jr. Angamos Mz.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from processing and selling pork products in the local community, particularly pork longganisa and tocino.

R. was born in and lives in the Barlovento neighborhood of Barranquilla.  It is an ancient community, which was invaded.  It is extremely vulnerable.  It is characterized by the activity of recycling.  Since she was little she was involved in making food because her parents did.  They did this on the outskirts of the ancient town river. They worked in this area because of its proximity to a branch of the largest river in Colombia, El Magdalena.\n\nShe is the oldest of four siblings.  She lived with her mother and the abandonment of her father.  That is why she saw the need to help with the household chores and with the business when she was barely ten years old.  She helped in order to get her younger siblings ahead.  This prevented her from going to school.  Reading and writing were not a practical necessity, and they were not important to the families of that era.\n\nRepeating her parents\u2019 history, Mar\u00eda del Carmen had twins after becoming engaged.  At first, her spouse supplied the basic family necessities.  But, after a short amount of time he abandoned them.  She had to work very hard to get her family ahead.  Without an education, and with the knowledge of the work she learned as a child, she started to sell \u201carepas de huevo\u201d (egg-filled savory corn cakes), empanadas, \u201ccariba\u00f1ola\u201d (small pie made with dough or puree of yucca that is filled with stew like ingredients and then fried), and fast food in the towns that are close to where the festivities for the national holidays are held.  \n\nAs a result of her second relationship, which lasted a short amount of time because he died, she built a house and educated her children until they had a technical career.  As time went by, she acquired the restaurant that her mother left her when she died.  The restaurant is now in her house, and her daughter and her sister work there.  \n\nFinancially helped with two loans, which she successfully repaid, from the Mario Santo Domino Foundation, she has been able to make on-site improvements to the infrastructure.  With her third loan, Mar\u00eda will buy chairs and utensils.  Her customers have increased, and when they arrive they have to wait for empty spaces to eat.  Everything then turns into chaos.  She will also buy rice, pork ribs, bacon, chicken, vinegar, oil, vegetables, and capers; which are the ingredients for making pies, \u201chayacas\u201d (cornmeal, meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves) or special foods; which are made from bijao leaves.  This is one of her specialties.  This way she takes advantage of the consumer habits that the customers have this time of year, and she will increase her sales.\n\nMar\u00eda\u2019s daughter helps her with reading and writing to participate in the business trainings.  Together they apply what they have learned to benefit the restaurant.  Her happiness, tenacity, love of work, deliverance, sacrifice and constant work stand out to us.  She has overcome adversity to give her family an improved well being.  Her greatest goal is that her children be able to continue with the business.  The business will be technically updated and perpetuated through the new generations.  Her greatest worry is the labor instability that reigns and puts the economy at risk.

She has been in this line of work for 20 years, and in that time has managed to significantly improve her family's living standards and pay to educate her children. By all appearances, her business is in good shape, and produces revenues of almost 500,000 Ugandan shillings a month. The prospects for growth also seem strong, which is why she is applying for a loan to buy more items to sell in her shop. By increasing her income, this loan will allow her to continue paying for her children's education, expand her business, and develop a small plot of land she owns into a profitable farm.

She now has a small grocery store in her home, which she and her husband run. The store is well-used by their neighbours, with opening hours from 6am to 9pm. For the moment, Se\u00f1ora Nolvia has no health problems, but there are seasons when sales drop and so do her earnings. Her goal is to grow the business and in this way increase her earnings to improve her quality of life. She is seeking the loan to buy sugar, rice, soft drinks, butter, meat, chicken, canned foods, bread, cookies, churros, sweets, sauces, pasta, etc. With the help of the loan, she will have more and better stock in her store, and her customers will be able to buy everything they need. She has worked with [field partner] FAMA before and is very grateful for the support she has received. She is very reliable in making her repayments. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Vilia Oneida L.

She lives in her own home with her husband and two children.  For the past twelve years, she has been selling trinkets.  She also makes and sells rosaries and crucifix charms to sell to churches and at commercial stores in the central market.  In the beginning Martha produced her own woven chains, pearl necklaces, and rosary charms.  However, the work was tedious and she sometimes did not have enough supplies to complete her orders.  Then she contracted the work of producing chains and pearl necklaces to her friends and neighbors and has done very well since then.  Now she is able to complete all of the orders that are submitted to her.  For this reason, Martha is very pleased with the work she has accomplished and wants to improve her sales methods.  All of her products are contained in a catalog from which she offers every type of rosary.  What she enjoys most about her job is that it is profitable and allows her to pay her four workers.

Her customers were her neighbors and her closest friends who have gradually recommended her to a lot more people.  As a result, she has managed to achieve a slight increase in new customers.  Her business assets are represented more than anything in her accounts receivable which have a turnover period of 14 days, and in her inventory.  Although she has a good profit margin, she doesn't have enough working capital to respond to her customers' orders.

Now her existing customers refer new customers to her and her customer base is growing notably. \r\n\r\nRosa's main goal is to strengthen her business.  For this reason, she needs to have a display cabinet so that she can keep her merchandise more ordered and be able to better display the products that she sells.

Having suffered a lot due to his parents being poor, he works incessantly to struggle with life\u2019s difficulties.  His talents allow him to properly meet the expectations of his customers, and he is highly valued in his neighborhood.  As a result of this encouragement, he started producing different kinds of shoes, bags and purses, belts, and other goods that he sells in the marketplaces of Tabligbo.  This business, which could be very profitable for him, has had trouble developing because he does not have enough capital at his disposal.  The shoes that he makes are highly appreciated in the marketplace, and he even receives orders from Lom\u00e9, the capital city.  He really needs financial support to be able to bolster and develop his business.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAnd so he is requesting a loan of $850 as capital to buy a machine and some materials of the trade in order to produce and sell shoes, bags, belts, etc.  The success of his plans will allow him to improve living conditions for him and his parents.

He is a very hard worker as he had to rely on his lands in order to feed his family. He has made efforts to educate some of his kids, but just as his parents could not afford to send him to school past the elementary level, there were times when he could not afford to educate all nine children. He still lives with some of his sons who help him on the farm. They all work the fields together in order to cultivate rice and sell it in the city. He hopes the loan will help him be more productive.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Victor is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T00:05:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-29T17:48:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21394},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:18:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40781},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:12:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45300},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:10:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99054},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:53:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106814}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T17:48:41Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:53:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11750,"name":"Gulbudag","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulbudag S. owns and operates a tea house\/restaurant in the town of Khachmaz on the North Eastern coast of Azerbaijan.

The two previous loans with Impro have been paid in full.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Christian Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl se\u00f1or Pablo Mendiz\u00e1bal vive en casa propia en la zona de Pasankeri ladera oeste de la Ciudad de La Paz con su madre y su peque\u00f1a hija de 8 a\u00f1os;  Pablo es profesor y trabaja en el magisterio de la ciudad de La Paz.\r\nCon los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores en Impro construy\u00f3 un muro de contenci\u00f3n para estabilizar su vivienda.\r\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado ser\u00e1 destinado a la construcci\u00f3n completa de una habitaci\u00f3n de ladrillo sobre loza de hormig\u00f3n armado. \r\nSu antecedente hist\u00f3rico con Impro, y el an\u00e1lisis socio econ\u00f3mico lo califica como cliente preferencial y puede acceder  un nuevo cr\u00e9dito.

Annamaria owns a business - she started a bird farm 5 years ago, and is currently raising 60 chickens, 23 turkeys, 80 ducks, and 30 guinea foul. The poultry business - sale of meat and eggs to supermarkets - allows her to earn a profit of around US$280 a month. Annamaria uses around US$65 of this amount for the maintenance of her farm.

She is married and has two children, ages 32 and 34. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant because his parents do not take care of him. Febronia has been running a poultry business since 2006. Raising kuku (kuku means chicken in Swahili) is popular in Tanzania, because they require little start-up capital. Poeple can start with one or two, and either buy additional ones as they have the money or they can let them multiply naturally! Also, chickens do not require much space, so sometimes they just let them run around in their garden or compound. In addition, while the chicks are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Febronia's business is doing well; she works at the business for eight hours per day, seven per week and is assisted by one employee. Febronia currently earns about $300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $850 USD to purchase additional chicks, chicken feed, and veterinary medicines. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Febronia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.
