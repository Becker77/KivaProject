Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Selling food is very lucrative and the only problem is when there is unsold food and Paulina does not recoup her investment. But on market days, she does well and even runs out of food. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Paulina's second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She will use the money to stock up on sweets and soft drinks for her restaurant. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":234696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To stock up on soft drinks and sweets for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T23:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":251.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957811},{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":753.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116548}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T18:23:06Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":82186,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mary tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, vive junto a su conviviente y sus 4 hijos que estudian y la apoyan mucho.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Fortunately, the daily consumption needs of her family are met because of the carenderia. Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative is a big help to her family and business.

She lives in a rented room and has great desire to get ahead in life. For more than 5 years she has been selling second-hand hats.  She found this activity to be the best way to support her family economically.  She buys the used hats from suppliers to then repair them and on Sundays, in the markets of the city of Juliaca, she sells them as an ambulatory salesperson.  For Celia, the most fun part of her job is to sell as she enjoys convincing her customers to buy something and sell out of her merchandise.  In the future she hopes to have a clothing store where she can sell with greater comfort and provide better service to her customers.  What she likes least about her work is having to walk all day long through the streets in search of clients.  Celia knows that the path to her goals is difficult, but this does not decrease her eagerness to accomplish them.  This is her second loan with MFP and she feels very happy about this opportunity for a loan.  She hopes to be able to repay it on time and in her communal bank she is one of the most participatory and responsible members. With the loan that she is requesting she will buy more hats to increase the amount of merchandise that she sells.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":305643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012469},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596059},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990323},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211446},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640949},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080417}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T20:08:59Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":106762,"name":"Sanoussi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame est une veuve qui vit seule avec ses 03 enfants dans le quartier d\u2019amouti\u00e9v\u00e9, l\u2019activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce et qui lui permet de subvenir aux charges de sa famille est le commerce des articles de mercerie et la vente de boissons, ce commerce lui r\u00e9ussit bien. , elle exerce son commerce pr\u00e8s du march\u00e9 d\u2019amouti\u00e9v\u00e9.Elle veut commencer le commerce de produits cosm\u00e9tiques pour augmenter ses recettes et bien subvenir aux charges de sa famille, elle  a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu un cr\u00e9dit qu\u2019elle a bien rembours\u00e9 et sollicite de WAGES son deuxi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit afin d\u2019acheter des produits cosm\u00e9tiques.","en":"This lady is a widow who lives alone with her three children in the Amouti\u00e9v\u00e9 district.

She is 48-years-old. Angeles is married and has four school-age children. To make a living, Angeles owns and operates an \"alimango\" fishing retail business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community. Angeles has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Angeles joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angeles has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Angeles is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seafood to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Angeles from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children and to be used for daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

They are a couple who want to be well set-up before becoming parents, because they don't want their children to lack anything. For two years, Edgar has farmed coffee and bananas on his own farmlands, which he inherited from his mother-in-law. He also works as a labourer on the land of some landowners, earning about 20 soles per day. His wife does housework but helps him at harvest time. His favourite part of his job is clearing the weeds from his land and harvesting his fruits; on the other hand, it is difficult to keep his fields safe from pests which hurt productivity. But he knows that in agriculture, one always earns something useful, and thus he considers agriculture to be profitable and he wants to expand his farmlands to keep growing coffee.\r\nHe is sure that he will become the best coffee producer in the area and, in order for his wife to also have economic benefits he will install a food store or a clothing store in their house. This is the second time he has taken out a loan with MFP, and as he already knows how the community group works together, he is happy to keep working with such very responsible and honest people. With the requested loan, he will buy 7 bags of fertilizer, and wood, nails and corrugated iron to finish the construction of the second floor of their home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":550442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"7 bags of fertilizer and materials for home completion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1209.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588200}],"funded_date":"2010-06-10T13:03:49Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":210040,"name":"Yameena's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yameena H. is a resident of Raiwind which is located near Lahore, Pakistan.

The city suits everyone:  the broad choice of work, the shiny streets, the entertainment, and the promising prospects of great success.  Only a few youth risk remaining in their native villages and building a life there where others have long since lost hope.  The heroes of our story are some of those few people who have decided to remain and achieve success gradually. \r\n\r\nNurjamal I. is forty-six years old.  Nurjamal is the mother of three children.

Bliss, Bogo, Cebu. She earns her living buying and selling ready-to-wear clothing. Her husband, Danilo C., who is 40 years old, works as a company driver and also helps in his wife's business. They have four children between three and 19.  \r\n\r\nLiza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to expand her clothing inventory so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Liza C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Mrs. Suos does not want her daughters to work far away from home, but due to the lack of finances, they are forced to work there. \r\n\r\nBesides farming, Mrs. Suos spends her spare time collecting palm fronds around the village, and then she attaches the leaves together for sale. This kind of product can be used for roofing. She can earn around $2 USD each day.

They live in traditional extended families in the village of Marka-Coungo (Region of Koulikoro, Republic of Mali).  Linked by ties of kinship and profession, this group essentially trades in cow's milk and milk products (fresh milk, curdled milk, cream, and butter).  The group is on its seventh solidarity loan (group loan) with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  All of the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nThey intend to use this loan to buy 700 liters of milk from livestock farmers locally in Marka-Coungo and from surrounding villages.  A portion of the milk is sold fresh, and the rest (milk products) are sold in the Marka-Coungo marketplace to customers composed of the residents and of wholesalers from big cities, such as Bamako (capital of Mali), Fana, and Koulikoro.  This operation is repeated every two days if the profit margin is very large. \r\n\r\nThey each envision realizing an average profit of 40,000 francs CFA per cycle that will be used to cover family expenses and the rest to boost working capital. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":224622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy milk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nagnini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doukou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350996},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974106},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889481},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440274},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135642},{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":68801.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033443}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T20:59:13Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":78106,"name":"Pablo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEl se\u00f1or Pablo Calderon es originario de la ciudad de Le\u00f3n y vive en el municipio de El Sauce junto con su familia compuesta por su esposa y su hijo al que tiene que mantener. \u00c9l se dedica a su actividad agropecuaria con la que mantiene a su familia que tanto necesita de su apoyo financiero.\n\nEl se\u00f1or C. se ha destacado en la crianza de novillos y siembra de hortalizas y la raz\u00f3n por la cual ha buscado el apoyo en Ceprodel es para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de los novillos para desarrollo.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every day at 6am, she goes out with her juice cart to look for clients to sell her delicious juices to. She sells different types of drinks over the course of the day: in the morning she sells her clients the very popular hot quinoa juice (a hot drink made from quinoa, tapioca and applesauce), later in the morning she sells fruit juices, and in the evening she sells \"emolientes\" (hot herbal drinks with curative properties) to warm the bones of the people who stop by her drink cart. Her favorite part of her work is chatting with her customers. She has had her business for 5 years now, and says that the hardest part is having to be on the street all day, withstanding harsh weather. She hopes to grow her business to the point where she can open up a store to serve her clients in a calmer environment. \r\n\r\nThis is Elisa's sixth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and she is very confident that she will be able to make all of her payments on time.

With the requested loan of 2,000 soles, she will buy new pots, glasses, and buckets, so that she can prepare her drinks more hygienically (the equipment she's currently using is very old). <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":364566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy new pots, glasses, and buckets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641692},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081134},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997284},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842628},{"amount":225.45,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":671.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734203}],"funded_date":"2009-08-07T17:54:14Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":131376,"name":"Maura","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maura es socia del Banco Comunal Sarita.\nMaura es casada, tiene 46 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Maura venD. alfalfa D. manera ambulatoria, sus ventas los realiza D. casa en casa, producto que adquiere D. los productores.\nMaura necesita un pr\u00e9stamo D. 600 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra D. alfalfa.\nLos sue\u00f1os D.

Bekishkan\u2019s husband and eldest son, who is twenty-five years old, rent minivans for deliveries. Three years ago, Bekishkan purchased seed potatoes. Bekishkan, along with her children, are growing potatoes for sale. The youngest daughter is in the tenth grade. She and her middle brother, are helping their mother. Their current monthly income from the sale of potatoes is slightly more than two and a half thousand soms ($55). It is a small income, but considering that at the very beginning, three years ago, they invested a total of about two thousand soms ($50) in the purchase of potatoes, as well as the fact that the potato season sales begin in the fall, we can assume that they will make a profit. Now, Bekishkan has plans to further develop her potato business. Bekishkan wants to get a loan and buy potato seed varieties called \"Mundial\", as well as to increase the acreage.\r\n<p> \r\nBekishkan\u2019s Partners for the group:\r\n<p>\r\nKulukan K. is fifty-two years old and her husband is unemployed.

Ten years ago, he was involved in raising cattle, but now for the past ten years, he raises and sells only sheep.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is married with five children. Syrga and her family breed cattle and sell agricultural products. Syrga started this business fifteen years ago when she bought a cow for the money she had saved. She managed to grow her business; now she owns six heads of cattle. The profits from this business helped Syrga provide her children with good dowry and contribute to her children's households.  The family's monthly profits from the sales of meat and dairy products range between 5,000 and 6,000 Kyrgyz som. In order to expand her business, Syrga turned to Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan of 135,000 Kyrgyz som. She is planning to use the loan for buying more cattle and to use the profits for expanding her business by increasing the number of cattle. In the future, she will use the money for her son's marriages and her daughter's dowry.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":873086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Achy village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-16T07:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":114,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Syrga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":135000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":777.78,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":35133.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338984},{"amount":2222.22,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100382.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743500}],"funded_date":"2011-09-25T00:51:24Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Oksana Buranbaeva","image":194074}},{"id":341206,"name":"Maria Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Teresa de 42 a\u00f1os, es casada vive en su casa propia, cuenta con todos los servicios b\u00e1sicos, tiene 2 hijos menores de edad a su cargo.

She is married and has five daughters, ages 3, 6, 9, 11, and 14. Her business is selling fruit. She is a good mother, optimistic, determined, tenacious, strong, responsible, and hard-working. She carries out her business in the town of Sacaba, which supports itself as the breadbasket of the city because of the production of cereals, vegetables, and fruits, even in the urban districts. Corn, wheat, barley, vegetables, fruits, bananas, papayas, oranges, apples, peaches, and even passion fruits are produced in Sacaba. There are also chicken farms, and people work in bee-keeping.\r\n\r\nVirginia has a dark complexion, long tied-back black hair, and short stature. Her mother tongue is Quechua, and she speaks Spanish. In her business, she speaks both languages. (She is the first one on the left, wearing an animal print sweater.) She lives with her husband, who works in construction, and their five daughters, of whom four are in school and the youngest is still in her care. The need to generate better economic income to pay the expenses of their five daughters led her to form a communal bank with people with businesses such as neighborhood store, butcher shop, video store, selling sandwiches, handicrafts in plaster, selling soft drinks, and a bookstore in order to apply for a loan and expand their businesses. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling fruit. Tens of trucks arrive daily from the Cochabamba tropics and unload their production of seasonal fruit. She has a storage area where she stores the fruit that is sold weekly. Her dream is to expand her business and improve her sales in order to improve the quality of life of her daughters.

Mariela has worked as an administrative assistant in a private insurance office for two years and has also had her own business in transportation services for 3 years.  She started her business with help from her father, with the objective of increasing her fleet of vans for better utility.  Thanks to loans from Afodenic, she will be able to buy construction materials such as cement, iron, blocks, bricks, and tin roofing to expand the kitchen and bedrooms of her house, offering her family a more comfortable and secure home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":250180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials to finish her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariela Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172.95,"local_amount":3374.72,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3413.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351539},{"amount":87.3,"local_amount":1703.37,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1722.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038877},{"amount":83.78,"local_amount":1634.76,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1653.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929173},{"amount":88.39,"local_amount":1724.7,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1744.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384085},{"amount":84.83,"local_amount":1655.27,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1674.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890548},{"amount":88.24,"local_amount":1721.84,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1741.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111845},{"amount":81.53,"local_amount":1590.89,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1609.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533264},{"amount":84.33,"local_amount":1645.49,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1664.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964644},{"amount":253.65,"local_amount":4948.96,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5005.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875120}],"funded_date":"2009-02-05T06:08:45Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:46:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":86314,"name":"Saliu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saliu A. is 41-years-old and is married with five children.

She earns a living as a farmer, cultivating rice on a plot of land that she owns. She faces problems with this cultivation because her field is infertile and she does not have much money to buy rice seeds and pesticides. In order to deal with these problems, she decided to ask for a loan to purchase fertilizer, rice seeds and insecticide to make her crops more productive. Her husband, Morn Pork, is a construction worker. Chrun P. is 33 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is a laborer who has been hired to thresh rice. Two of her children attend the local school, while the youngest is too young to work or study. She and her husband are pictured in the photo.

In the long years of their marriage, they were given five children: Raymund, 21 years old; Benito, 18 years old; Kimberly, 16 years old; Nelson, 14 years old; and Maih Cecilio, 9 years old. One of their frustrations as parents is that most of their children have been able to attain only a low level of education because of they have insufficient income to pay for their educational expenses, especially since they have more children that they need to send to school. Their dream is their other children be able to finish their studies because education is one of the things they needed to fight against poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nNelly and her husband work hard for this. They have two sources of income: she is running a variety store business, and her husband works as a driver. She has been running her variety store business for 10 years now and she really wants it to grow more.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), she has used every loan that she received to improve this business. She is a very good member of ASHI. She has been in the institution for 9 years; she started in the year 2000. Now, her 12th loan will be used again for this business: she will buy what her store needs, like sacks of rice, different groceries and many more items that will sell in her store. She is hoping that after buying all of these, her business will be more productive and continue growing.\r\n<p>\r\nAside from dreaming that their children would finish their studies someday, she also dreams of turning their variety store into a mini grocery store so that they will earn more for their family. That is why they will work hard--for the fulfillment of these dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":425188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They are on average 34 years old with 3 children. They met each other through neighbours and through their businesses, and they sell a variety of products. Having repaid their first joint loan without any problem, they are now on their second loan with a view to diversifying and making their business profitable. This loan will be used to buy 3 pieces of 30-meter long white bazin, 10 wax-printed loincloths, 35 items of children's clothing (baby clothes, dresses, trouser suits, skirt suits), 20 sets of chains, earrings, bracelets and some rings, 12 bottles of varnish, 12 khol pencils, 250kg of rice and 500kg of \"fabourama\" tubers. Most of the time they get their supplies from the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market, from the fairworkers coming from Massigui, and at Niono. They sell their goods at the same Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market, the wax-printed loincloths while walking through the Hamdallaye neighbourhoods and the \"fabourama\" at the market in M\u00e9dine. The goods are sold for cash and on credit to both male and female customers. They are expecting to make an average monthly profit of 27,835 FCFA which will be used to repay loans, and also to contribute to household expenses and social events (baptisms, marriages, circumcisions and funerals), the purchase of items which will gradually make up young girls' marriage trousseaux as well as the building up of savings. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":444143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-09T14:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zarra                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763611},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-26T09:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152446},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991287},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-20T08:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021558},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746353},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75492.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778899}],"funded_date":"2009-12-10T02:38:51Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":164415,"name":"Faustina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustina is thirty-two.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Sometimes you are able to help them. and just because you are not familiar with them. you just walk beside these people not even realizing who they are, and therefore reading these stories is a real way to help people. \r\n<p>\r\nThe heroes of this story are ordinary people from Kyrgyzstan. S. Nurjan, 31, is the leader of this group. She comes from Tokmok, a provincial town in the north of Kyrgyzstan. She is married and has two sons. Her husband works in the military; he is a foreman. Both of Nurjan\u2019s sons were too little to go to school and Nurjan had to stay at home and look after the children. Nevertheless, Nurjan\u2019s sister advised her to start a trade in something, so about two years ago, Nurjan started trading in shoes and socks. Now she has a stable income of about seventy dollars per month. This has allowed her to save some funds and buy some items of furniture for the house. Nurjan is in need of a loan. She would like to invest some funds that would help her to buy more kinds of shoes and socks, which in turn would boost her sales. In near future she is planning to buy a car. Her plans go as far as to buy a three\u2013room flat. \r\n<p>\r\nThese people are Nurjan\u2019s partners:\r\n<p>\r\nAyim is twenty-seven. She lives in Tokmok. Her spouse works in the Border Service of the Kyrgyz Republic. Ayim has a son. Ayim has been fortunate. Due to her husband\u2019s job, she sent her son to a kindergarten and started trading in men\u2019s and women\u2019s shoes. Ayim hopes to obtain this loan and invest the funds to increase the turnover.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnara is 32. She has two children. Since the collapse of Soviet Union, she has been engaged in commerce near a hospital. Now, she plans to sell foodstuffs at school. She needs a loan to purchase goods and foodstuffs to increase the turnover. With the return, she will pay for her daughter\u2019s education. \r\n<p>\r\nAnara is fifty. Her husband took part in the Afghan war and now is retired. Anara has three children. Her eldest daughter goes to high school. The rest are little and stay at home with Anara. Anara needs a loan to make a repair in her flat.\r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: buying and selling rice, a general store, and farming businesses. Rosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy rice to resell so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Rosemarie C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Corazon L., 43, finished only high school, but that far contradicts what she has accomplished in her life. Ma. Corazon is married to Henry, a regular employee. They have two children; one is in high school and the other in elementary. Ma. Corazon's family resides in Caloocan City, Philippines.\n\nMa. Corazon presently owns a junk shop and runs a ready-to-wear (RTW) business. She has been in business for ten years now. People in her community serve as Corazon's target market, and every month she earns around Php 8,000. She accepts used bottles and old newspapers for recycling. She also sells clothes which suits the tastes of her neighbors and friends.\n\nBut life isn't all about business. Ma. Corazon sees in parallel the needs of her business as well as the needs of her children. Realizing that she needs more than what she can produce at the moment, she would like to apply for Php 38,000 loan. Ma. Corazon will use the money to buy merchandise in bulk for her business. She also intends to buy two computer units and start up a computer shop. \n\nShe aspires for her junk shop to grow, because in the end, it will benefit her family, especially her children.  She faithfully attends weekly fellowship* meeting.\n\nThe price of junk items has gone down, and that really poses a business challenge to Ma. Corazon, but she knows that all things eventually work out for the good of God's people. God never treats His children like trash, and neither does Ma. Corazon. She values her children so much, and her desire is  for them to finish schooling and serve God in their lives.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro finance loans.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":648590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"additional bulk merchandise for inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-11-25T14:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

The competition in his field does not pose difficulties for him; however, material concerns do. These difficulties limit how much he can develop his business. He has a lot of experience in his field.

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"This community bank is called \u201cF\u00e9nix\u201d (Phoenix).  It is made up of 18 entrepreneurs who work in different businesses including: a bakery, a hairdressing salon, a food sales business and a dressmaking business.  They all live in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nSara is in the front row of the photo, second from the left, wearing a purple sweater and jeans.  During the week, she sells charcoal from her home.  On weekends, she makes and sells fast food, specifically 'sopaipillas' (a type of fried pastry or quick bread), cheese empanadas and fries.  She works from 4.00pm to 3.00am as this is when her customers come to her business.  She sets herself up with a grill on a corner near her home.\r\n\r\nSara has been working in this field for one year.  She says that things have gone very well since she started her business.  She buys the ingredients that she uses to prepare her food in wholesale supermarkets and from a farmers' market.\r\n\r\nSara will use her loan to buy charcoal, a 100kg bag of flour, yeast, oil, salt, potatoes and paper bags.  Sara's dream is to own a car.\r\n\r\nSara lives with her husband and they are waiting to move into their own home which will be sometime in the coming year.  Depending on this move, Sara plans to set up her business in her new home.\r\n\r\nSara is very happy and grateful for the loan from Fondo Esperanza as it has helped her to invest in her business and make more profits.  The community bank that she belongs to is very united and Sara has been able to listen to the business experiences of other members.  In addition, she is very motivated and participates actively in the meetings as she is the bank's secretary.\r\n\r\nTalca is in Maule region which is located in the central area of the country.  It is an administrative, financial and cultural center of the region as it is the most important city in the Chilean Central Valley.  There is a curious expression in Chile \"Talca, Par\u00eds y Londres' (Talca, Paris and London).  Among the different suggestions about where the saying comes from, some say that it comes from something that an English person originally said \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca is like London) owing to the abundant mist that frequently covers the city in winter, just like it does in the English capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":813164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in a rented home with her mother, her child and her aunt, with whom she shares her joy and her desire to succeed. Katherin starts her day very early, when she goes out to make her purchases for her business. She sells food in a restaurant. Her building is rented but it is located in a high-traffic area of the city, which is very beneficial. She is new to this business, and has been in it for a few months. She is grateful to have the help of her mother and aunt, who always support her. Having direct contact with her customers is what she most likes about her job, and her main inconvenience is having to get going very early in the mornings. However, Katherin knows that her business' growth depends on this, and so she accepts the challenge in order to continue moving forward and thus provide a good education for her child. This is the first loan between Katherin and MFP. She feels comfortable because she knows that the amount she has requested is small and that with her business projections she will be able to repay all of her quotas on time. With the requested 1000 soles, she will purchase an industrial kitchen and a grill, because she wants to sell grilled food in the evenings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":841978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase an industrial kitchen and a grill because she wants to sell grilled food at night.

They have one child and live together in the Pichari district. Elizabeth recycles all types of products, working in the Pichari district and its annexes. She started this job out of economic need. She had seen this kind of business being carried out in the capital, and wanted to start it up in her own city. She got a vehicle to transport recyclable products. In the beginning, she did not have enough capital to buy a good amount of products. She recycles bottles, milk cans, cardboard and paper. Upon collection, these items go through a sorting process and are then passed through a compressor. Elizabeth is happy to have her business because it provides her with a good income.

At first, she used her borrowed money of 125 USD to breed pigs. She got a very good profit. Therefore, she continued to borrow 450 USD to buy buffalos to assist in practising agriculture. Her family economy improves gradually. She can send her children to good school and furnish her house. This time she wants to borrow 575 USD to buy pigs and chickens to breed.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 48 years old, lives alone in his own home, and has been separated for the past 20 years.  He has a 17 year old son who is studying in the city of Tarma, which is 5 hours away by car from his home.  Esteban enjoys his work.  As a young man, he liked to engage in hard labor and taking care of plants because he knew these activities could bring in a good income.  For this reason, he gets up early in the morning to remove all the weeds and shrubs around his plantation.  He enjoys planting coffee the most even though it takes three years for the crop to mature.  Estaban also likes the harvest season when he can bring his goods to market and earn a good profit.  With the savings he accumulates, he invests in the crops for the following season and also sends some spending money to his son for school, since he wants him to become a professional.    \r\n<p>\r\nEsteban is very grateful to the president of his Communal Bank for inviting him to be part of their group.  He has agreed to make all his payments on time so that he does not disappoint the other members.

She is 35 years old, single and lives in a home that was provided by social services for her and her 3 sisters, whom she cares for.  She has never been married.  She studied until 12th grade and she also pays for her sisters\u2019 schooling.  She also sends money to her mother, who lives in Gaza province.  Ancha grew up with her parents in Maputo and later her mother moved to Gaza, where Ancha also moved in 1986.  Twenty years later she and her 3 sisters moved back to Boane.  She is a typist for the Regional Water Administration (ARA in Portuguese), and receives 7.000,00MT per month.  Before she began working for this public company, she worked for Radio Mozambique for six years, in the same capacity.  This is her second loan with Hluvuku-Adsema for 17.000,00MT.  She will use the money to buy cement, steel, rocks and other materials needed to build a brick home.  Her previous loan was used for household items, thanks to information she received from coworkers.  She pledges to pay this loan with no problems so she will qualify for loans in the future.  In the near future she would like to get married and return to school to attend college.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

shared by Mrs. Evangeline P. one of the responsible mothers in bry. Roxas, Solano,Nueva Vizcaya. She is married to Mr. Alfredo P. but unfortunately, they are not blessed with a child. Although, they legally adopted a child whom they called Mark Justin P. 7 years old a grade-I pupil. They want their adopted child to be successful in the future so that he will be the one to take care of them when they got old. In this regard, they are doing all their best to support his education so that he will find a stable job someday. \n\tFarming is the common source of their living, they till their land twice a year by planting rice and some vegetables. Since harvesting takes a long time, Mrs. Evangeline put-up a small sari-sari or general store in their village to earn additional income. She used the loan she availed in the Microfinance organization to acquire different grocery items, soft drinks and frozen foods. Her average income for month is amounting to P 5,000.00 which they utilized to acquire their daily basic needs and to pay her weekly loan amortization. Due to our economic crisis, she wants to strengthen her small business to increase her income to satisfy their basic needs and save for their future. She applied a higher amount of P 5,000.00 to strengthen her capital in improving her small store. She wants to buy more grocery items to be able to increase more profit.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":404770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

J.\u2019s three children, aged from 20 to 27, are already adults with her two eldest now having their own family, she still doesn\u2019t want to resign from her career of being a mother to them. She wants to support their lives and those of their own families until they can get out from the umbrella of poverty. Menda\u2019s husband was unemployed and that has added to the challenges of her life as a woman and the need to become productive. \r\n\r\n<p>With faith that one day she will be able to find a way to improve the life of her family, Menda was very happy to learn about ASHI way back in 2005. Then Menda and her husband agreed that she must join ASHI so she could request a loan which would be their source of financial capital to start up a business to earn a daily income. They thought of setting up a small eatery since her husband is a good cook. \r\n\r\n<p>After several loans from ASHI, their eatery has eventually grown and has been sustained. Menda has also been able to finance a 'buy and sell' business in partnership with her unemployed eldest son. Proceeds are equally divided between them so her son can support his own family's needs. The loan will be used to purchase bulk ingredients for cooking foods for her eatery. Some of the loan will be used to purchase bulk onions, salt and garlic for her son's 'buy and sell' business.\r\n\r\nAs much as possible, Menda wants to grow and stabilize her eatery and her 'buy and sell' business through the support of loans through ASHI. Proceeds of her business would enable her to support her dream of sending her two children back to school until they graduate from college so they can have a different kind of life in the future - a life that is not poor.

After the winter season, the harvest is stored for a while as its price increases before being sold at the big markets of San, Dah, and other nearby markets, retail (often wholesale too) for cash to customers mostly coming from big towns. \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, each group member expects to obtain an income  between  21,000  and 39,500 West African francs, which will be used to pay off the loan interest and cover ongoing family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":567425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing agricultural inputs, seeds and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dangasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":520000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":520000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":520000,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":520693.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360747}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T23:33:27Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":218282,"name":"Kiden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kiden J.  is currently in the business of selling dried fish and tomatoes at the market and is requesting a loan to stock bags of rice and beans to sell.

Emilia has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP whenever she sells her raised animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the first loan that Emilia has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 51 years old and is the group leader of this ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nWilma is married and has two adult children. She owns and operates a business making and selling food, primarily preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Wilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nWilma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital. This loan will be her 4th from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/font>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":606730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Alma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers and glutinous rice for her food vending so that she can continue to save or the future education of her child. Alma S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

through and overcome. Our CCT* community partner, Revelieta D. C. or Nene as friends call her, proves it to be so. At 30, Revelieta has reached college and is married to Eddie, an ice cream maker. Their sweet marriage brought to life one child, who is in elementary school. REvelieta's family resides in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAt present, Revelieta focuses on running her sari-sari (variety) store. She aims to meet the daily needs of her neighborhood with soft drinks and grocery items such as shampoo, canned goods, seasonings, among others. She also sells products from Avon, a brand of beauty products. With this business, Revelieta earns an average of Php300 a day.\r\n\r\nRevelieta knows inside of her that the variety store would not be enough to meet the needs and wants of her family. To continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for Php11, 000 loan. She plans to use this money to add more items to her store. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Revelieta faces at present is the difficulty of updating people with the payment of their debts. All that she dreams of in life is to make her family happy and give them a house they could call their own. She gives her best to make sure her only child gets a good education until  college. Life is not all the time sweet, but with all the efforts she is doing for her family, she sees to it that she will emerge an overcomer bringing home a sweet success. \r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

All the children attend school except one. \r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of 50,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow.

She buys her products based on the time of year, or for an upcoming holiday.  For example, in the summer she sells t-shirts and handbags.  She also focuses on certain holidays: for Mother\u2019s Day, she buys chocolates and women\u2019s accessories; for Father\u2019s Day, she buys men\u2019s products; for birthdays, she buys toys; for Christmas, she buys all types of items to give as gifts.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago, since she can obtain a greater variety of products there.  Also, Naya likes to buy high-quality merchandise in order to keep her customers.  Naya works Monday to Sunday from a location she has on the street.  She has dedicated herself to this business for 30 years.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy socks, t-shirts, knitwear, and fleece for men, women and children, as these are the items she sells the most of during the winter season.  Her goal is to move her business to an established site, as it is difficult to work on the street during summer and winter because of the hot and cold temperatures.  Her motivation to continue working is her desire to help support her family.\r\n\r\nNaya lives with her husband and 9-year old daughter.  This family is currently going through a very painful time, due to the passing of Naya\u2019s oldest son 6 months ago.  Her dream is to provide a quality education for her daughter, and see her become a career professional.  Naya is very thankful for access to credit and the support provided by Fondo Esperanza for carrying on with her enterprise.  She finds the group\u2019s meetings to be very pleasant, and serves as the Secretary of the management board.  \r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 km northeast of Santiago.  It is the regional capital, and also the seat of legislative power of the country.

family and two sons, who are seven and five years old, in the the Oi-Tal village (north-eastern part of Kyrgyzstan).  In search of a source of income, Akylbek started his own business of breeding livestock, growing and reselling agricultural crops in 1996.  Akylbek has apple and pear trees on his plot of land and also devotes special attention to cultivating and growing a particular variety of potatoes that is in higher demand among the local residents.  His persistent and tireless labor in the business allows Akylbek to cover his family's and household expenses and also to plan his children's future.  In order to further increase his livestock quantity, Akylbek requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy additional livestock headcount for fattening up.  He plans to use the planned profit for the purchase of fodder and hay for the winter, so that he can start reselling livestock in the spring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":909266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Oi-Tal village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akylbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":40416.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938339},{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40416.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776801}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T09:46:40Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":357647,"name":"Jacklyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacklyne is a hardworking business woman aged 29.

She is 35 years old, married and the mother of three children 9, 4 and 1 year old. The oldest attends school. She completed 10th grade and is still studying- she is currently in the second year of teacher training. She lives with her family in her own home, and supports her mother who lives in the village of Mahubo sending her money for household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe has never left Boane district, and was born in Mahubo. Later, she built a home with her family in the Fichi neighborhood of Boane where she continues to live. She has been an employee of the Ministry of Education for over nine years, and was trained at the Teacher Training Center in Namaacha. She works from 11 am until 5:55 pm and earns a monthly salary of 4500 MZN, which she uses for household expenses as well as saving some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nShe has never taken out loans with other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the organization. This is her fourth loan, for 10,000 MZN, which she plans to use to buy construction materials (cement, rebar, sand, stone and others) to continue building her residence. The previous loans were for 10,000, 15,000 and 30,000 MZN, all for the same purpose. In the future she would like to take out additional loans to complete construction of her house and invest more in the business that she is starting.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nJocelyn is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Jocelyn owns and operates a business that provides recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from collecting junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years, and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional waste and junk materials to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jocelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Habibulo is from the district of Dj.Rasulov, Tajikistan. Currently, he dedicates himself to his livestock business, a popular enterprise that is characteristic of the region. He is the father of 4 children who he cares for and has the responsibility of educating. It\u2019s important to note that Habibulo is very conscious of his duty to support his family financially. For this reason, he turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to purchase some pregnant cows to help him increase his income. With your help, Habibulo will be able to make his business succeed and support his family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and marking the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He will be seated at his 'desk', composed of a plastic chair and table, alongsiD. his wooden display filled with sweets and snacks, selling to pedestrians who circulate there. The latter have also provided potential that motivated him to start his other business, offering telephone calling plans.\r\n\r\nIvan is a young Carib, by nature happy and cordial, who belongs to \u201cAsovesur\u201d, the organization that brings together all the stationary merchants located around BaranquilL.'s 'Metrocentro', its commercial center.  They will soon be relocated to a gallery in construction as ordered by the state, as part of the city's pedestrian zone organizing process. Ivan's business is located where there is much competition and he takes advantage of that. He knows his competitors and understands that his sustainability depends upon interrelations with them, as does increasing his income, which is occurring day to day.\r\n\r\nIvan's punctual repayment of his 4 loans with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo have distinguished him. For this reason, he is now soliciting a Kiva loan to continue increasing his sales, augmenting his working capital, and to continue improving his family's standard of living, as he has been doing up to now. With this loan he wants to acquire additional cellular phone plans and to buy the products generally needed by a tobacconist's shop. In the future he plans to obtain his own home through the 'Sue\u00f1os y Opportunidades' (Dreams and Opportunities) program in Villas D. San Pablo, by means of which the Foundation works with state subsidies to offer loans to assist with the financial closing for dwellings.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims,

in GMA, Cavite, Philippines.  With the help of her four working children, she works hard daily to earn a living and able to send her youngest child even up to college.\r\n\r\nAt present, Leticia focuses on running her sari-sari (variety) store. She aims to meet the daily needs of her neighborhood in soft drinks and grocery items such as shampoo, and also canned goods, and seasonings, among others. With this business, Leticia earns an average of Php 300 a day.\r\n\r\nLeticia knows inside her that the sari-sari store will not be enough to meet the needs and wants of her family. To help her continue operation of her variety store, she would like to apply for a Php 25,000 loan. She plans to use this money to add more items to her store and keep the small business in shape. In just a small period of time, she intends to turn her small sari-sari store into a real grocery store, with more items to meet the needs of people in her community.\r\n\r\nAll that Leticia dreams of in life is to make her family happy and give them a house they can call their own. She gives her best to make sure her youngest child gets a good education up through college. Life is not always sweet, but with all the efforts she is making for her family, she sees to it that she will emerge a winner, bringing home sweet success.  Leticia faithfully attends weekly fellowship* meetings. \r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":648658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

you\u2019re a woman looking for shoes, clothing or something to decorate your home or dining room, make sure to stop by Evgeniya\u2019s little store in Nikopol, Ukraine. She offers an attractive array of reasonably priced shoes, clothing, tablecloths and souvenirs. If she doesn\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking for, she can help you find someone who does.\r\n<p>\r\nVendors like Evgeniya form the backbone of a prosperous market economy in Ukraine. These entrepreneurs have, often with little help, been able to start and sustain small businesses which provide enough income for them to live on. For many their goal is to expand by opening new kiosks or renting larger retail space. They may never be the size of Wal-Mart but they\u2019ve started in much the same way. \r\n<p>\r\nEvgeniya has requested a six month loan for $500 which will give her some additional working funds for her business. She believes that God has blessed her through the financial help of \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d.
