Muminakhon is 41 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is married and the loving mother of two children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was a little girl, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. Now she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle. With the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. She is asking for a US$700 loan with the term of 5 months in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially increase her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in Silang, Cavite, north of Manila. Rolando works as a chef in a local restaurant in their community.\r\n\r\nLinda owns and manages a coin bank manufacturing business for almost ten years now, which basically serves as her family's main source of income. They make these items in their own shop, which is adjacent to their house. After ten years in this business, she has established patrons of her products who buy them on a wholesale basis. Linda earns at least Php1,000 in sales every day. \r\n\r\nLinda is applying for a loan of Php50,000, which she plans to use to purchase raw materials needed to continue operation of her business. She believes that additional capital will increase production at her business, that would cater to the demands of her wholesalers.\r\n\r\nAt present, Linda finds the frequent rain greatly affects delivery of orders for her clients. However, Linda still hopes and believes that God has destined her for greater things. She dreams of owning a bigger business with more customers to cater to, even in Metro Manila and beyond. Further, it is her dream that her children will be able to finish their studies in college. Linda has been a member of Center for Community Transformation a for few years now and regularly attends fellowship meetings*.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Every day she heads to a family member's stable where she looks after her cow.  Very early in the morning she milks her cow and obtains fresh milk which is then sold to her customers who are dairy product salesmen.  In addition to selling milk, she processes it into yoghurt and cheese.  She also sells 'mazamorra' (a Peruvian dessert) in an itinerant manner which provides daily income for her home.  She enjoys her work a lot, she already has several years' experience and now her great desire is to have more cows.  This is her 13th loan with MFP.

She worked as a secretary and got married when she was 25 years old. After marriage, Consolacion resigned her work. She and her husband are blessed with two children. Her husband is a farmer working in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn times of financial crisis, Consolacion goes abroad just to sustain her family needs. She worked as a domestic helper for 10 years. When she had enough earnings, she came back to the Philippines and make a decision to put up a sari-sari store business in which she sells snack foods, sugar, coffee, vinegar and cooking oil.\r\n \r\nConsolacion says even though there are struggles in her life, she is still happy because she successfully sent her children to college and holds a degree.

He has only had his farm for several years, but it is serving well to feed his wife and his infant child. He wants to invest the loan received in improving his crop output. He hopes to buy more seeds, fertilizer and pesticides. His long term goal is to improve his home for his growing family. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T04:45:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-01T22:02:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:40:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71902},{"amount":909,"local_amount":909,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:22:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":909,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99064},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210200}],"funded_date":"2007-04-17T22:02:33Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T16:44:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12234,"name":"Reyna","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"For the past 7 years, Reyna has focused on selling plastic products.

With these prospects, she envisions expanding enough to open a shop at the Koko marketplace. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":262140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy beauty products for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maimouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440352},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:55Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135730},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033531},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620899},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019864},{"amount":29.56,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:12Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242622},{"amount":29.52,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678144},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112406},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:01Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028062},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873452},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":13636.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":14691.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763207}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T10:54:36Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":90082,"name":"Choun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Choun S., 36, lives with her husband and daughter in the Kampong Cham province.

Iskandar has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and the three children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Iskandar provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Iskandar sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of $600. Iskandar thanks Kiva for the support that Kiva provides to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tenia temor de  regresar a trabajar en  la agricultura, pero luego de un tiempo se decidi\u00f3, y aplico las t\u00e9cnicas agr\u00edcolas que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 su padre y ahora es uno de los mejores productores, pues desde hace 8 a\u00f1os cultiva  diferentes tipos de tub\u00e9rculos, adem\u00e1s de avena (pastizal), en sus terrenos propios. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta es trabajar sus tierras y mantenerlas siempre limpias y verdes, porque as\u00ed auguran una cosecha exitosa, sin embargo, le disgusta no contar con la ayuda de nadie, por eso piensa arrendar todos sus terrenos a su hermano, adem\u00e1s quiere comprar cantidad de animales menores como cuyes, gallinas y conejos pues quiere  instalar su granja.Es la d\u00e9cima vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y como es parte de la junta directiva, se siente contento de seguir trabajando con los integrantes de su banco comunal, porque son personas responsables en el pago de sus cuotas.Marcelo tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de  varios sacos de abono para esparcirlos en sus cultivos, pues desea mejorar la calidad, de esta manera espera continuar progresando. ","en":"Marcelo, 65, has been separated from his partner for 21 years, but he doesn't have children so he lives alone in his own house in the company of his tenants. In his youth he was a train and truck operator in a mine site, from which he retired and immediately when to live in the city of his birth. Marcelo was afraid of going back to work in agriculture, but arrived at a point when he decided to do so and applied the agricultural techniques that his father taught him. Now he is one of the best producers in the region. For 8 years Marcelo has cultivated different types of tubers, as well as wheat (grass) on his own plots of land. What he enjoys most about his work is working on the land and keeping his crops clean and green, as this assures him of an excellent harvest. Nevertheless, he doesn't like not having anyone to help him and so he is thinking about renting his land out to his brother. Marcelo also wants to purchase a quantity of small animals, such as guinea pigs, chickens and rabbits, and to install a barn. This is the tenth time he has had a loan from MFP, and as he is part of the board of directors he feels happy to continue working with the members of his communal bank as they are very responsible people. Marcelo plans to invest this loan in the purchase of sacks of fertiliser to scatter on his crops as he wants them to be of a better quality, and in this way continue with his business.  \r\n\r\n<br

The Kiva loan will help Manohari to purchase materials for these processes so that the business can produce more stock in time for the big sale season. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":881888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wood to craft children's toys and learning tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Tangal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-09-30T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manohari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691556},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647921},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667.01,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T09:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865053},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1666.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275038},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1814.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416504},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-24T08:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1815.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131305},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1661.98,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-23T08:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1809.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947105},{"amount":114.58,"local_amount":8338,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":9080.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296494}],"funded_date":"2011-09-30T18:46:29Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":344996,"name":"Wanjohi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wanjohi is a resident and a farmer in the Kitale area of Western Kenya.

He is married and already has 5 children.  His wife does not have a job.  She stays at home and takes care of the house, raises the children and feeds the livestock when she is able.  Yusufjon fattens and sells livestock.  The start of spring is the season for purchasing livestock for Yusufjon, because it is currently cheap.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Vaivao has 4 years of experience in this business.  Vaivao needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 110 tala or US $46 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vaivao joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Vaivao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vaivao T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

There the majority of the population works in agriculture and livestock, but the younger ones have migrated to the city to look for better work opportunities.\r\n\r\nRosa is 44 years old and is a widow.  Her husband died 2 years ago of alcoholism.  Their marriage produced 5 children, who are now 22, 20, 18, 16,and 15 years old.  Her oldest son works as an mason's assistant, and helps his mother economically.  Her 20 year old daughter works in a restaurant, and also is completing distance studies during each Sunday.  Her 18 year-old son, after a long struggle, finally graduated from SECAP.  The other son, who is 16, is currently studying in secondary school.  Finally, her 15 year-old daughter works in child care and studies on Saturdays.  The whole family lives in small rooms that were built on their father's lands.\r\n\r\nRosa works in the home carrying out household chores, and she also raises pigs and poultry.  She has been a member of our institution for 7 loan cycles, and in this way she has been able to increase the number of animals that she has, so that she can later sell them and support herself.  With the new loan that she is receiving from the fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will invest in the purchase of pigs and chicken.

He has a general store where he sells all types of food such as rice, cereals, beverages, and other items.\r\n<p>\r\nPrior to having his store, Hugo operated a food stand where he sold \u201cfritadas\u201d (a traditional Ecuadorian dish made of pork, corn, and onions).  Using his savings, he decided to buy a few provisions to sell so that he could spend more time with his two children.  This turned out to be a good decision because he now has his own store where he works every day from 5:30am to 10pm.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to generate more household income he wants to use this loan to buy rice, beverages, and canned goods for his store.

She has worked there for 9 years. She started it in the city and and has had it in the community now for three years. She is asking for the loan this time to invest in her store and buy what she needs the most, such as canned goods, sugar, milk, eggs, bread. What she needs the most is food, what people consume the most.   \r\n\r\nShe remarks that her only problem is that she has too much competition everywhere and because of this her sales can't go up. Nonetheless, she is sure that the loan will help her to have better prices to offer her customers since people always look for the best price with the best quality. So if she gives her customers lower prices her clientele will grow. \r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to have her grocery store well stocked and off course benefit the whole community with the low prices. \r\nAngelina will invest in the grocery store and the other members will invest in other activities. Carlos in an internet cafe, Guadalupe in Herbalife (teas), Mar\u00eda, Estephani, Edith and Horalia will invest in animals such as sheep, chickens, pigs and turkeys. Rosa Maria will invest in in a small store, Rubin in a stove, Catalina in clothes. \u201cWe are all very happy and grateful for the loan they have given us, since it will help us to improve our quality of life and also that of our families.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3875,"image":{"id":927617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bread, milk, sugar, eggs and canned goods.

She is studying Nursing at CampoAlto.  Fabiola lives with her sister, brother-in-law, and a nephew in a bit of a difficult situation.  Her sister works during the day at the houses of other families, her brother-in-law works at a security guard station, and Fabiola works as a housekeeper who contracts out her services.  Her salary is dependent on each job.  <br \/><br \/>At home Fabiola contributes each month toward her sister\u2019s expenses, the rent payment, buying food, utility services, and transportation.  Due to these numerous expenses, there have been several months in which the only thing left she can pay is her monthly tuition.  Sometimes she hasn\u2019t been able to pay anything at all.  <br \/><br \/>Since her sister and brother-in-law do not have jobs that earn a lot of money, it has been difficult for her to obtain loans.  For this reason, she needs the help that Kiva offers.  Many times she has not been able to cover her monthly tuition payment to CampoAlto, so she has had to find extra work or seek private loans on her own in order to pay the bill.  A year ago Fabiola had to postpone her studies, but she continues to look for ways to continue her education.

from Tanzania! Rehema S. is a twenty-eight-year-old married woman from Dar es Salaam. Rehema owns and operates a small stall, which she established six months ago, from which she sells roasted fish. She buys fresh fish daily from local fishermen as they come in with their morning catch. Rehema roasts and sells these fish either in the fish market or along the roads of Dar. Given its location along the Indian Ocean, fish is plentiful in the waters around Dar es Salaam and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet. Rehema is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of 120 USD. She is currently requesting a loan of 225 USD in order to purchase fish in larger quantities. In the future, Rehema plans to open another stall to sell her delectable treats.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":192685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies of fish in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T18:34:32Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25555.56,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26634,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356218},{"amount":22,"local_amount":24444.44,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":25476,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347971},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970545},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886762},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436022},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:54Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130296},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027127},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613167},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010250},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26055,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232561}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T18:34:32Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65526,"name":"Mwanaid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaid is 29  years old and  is married with 3 children between the ages of  9 and 2.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, catching large fish.  Fonofaavae has 3 years of experience in this business.  Fonofaavae needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing boat and a fishing net.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fonofaavae joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fonofaavae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fonofaavae A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

These ladies believe that their 1350 Quetzales loan (an average of US $178), can launch them into the more lucrative business of Guatemalan weaving.<\/P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The loan would be used to buy fabric for their weaving. The women plan to do all the weaving themselves, and the finished fabrics would be sold in the nearby market in San Jose Poaquil.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>It is impressive how most of these women have more than one business. Portfolio diversification is a strategy they are currently managing. This shows that, even though these women live in a remote area, they have managed to learn updated and sophisticated managerial skills.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>These women hope that their future investment

Yanet has dedicated herself to a number of occupations which is how, two years ago, she began selling clothing door-to-door throughout Juliaca.  She enjoys this business because the clothing is much sought-after by local residents.  The most difficult part is moving her merchandise around to sell.  Thanks to God, she counts on the support of her children who are always close to help her with her daily sales which she carries out all day.  Yanet had to help her children get ahead single-handedly, and wants to bring them better opportunities as they grow and become men and women.

The group members average 41 years of age and five children.  They live in traditional polygamous families in the Bamanan Kin district of Kirango, in the sub-prefecture of Markala (fourth administrative region of Mali). \r\n\r\nEach belonging to the same traditional mutual-aid association and doing the same income-generating work, namely buying and selling fish and grain, the women of the Sabougnouman group decided jointly to sign up with the institution two years ago.  After having correctly repaid their two preceding loans, the group is on its third solidarity loan (group loan). \r\n\r\nThey intend to use this new loan to buy:  50 baskets of fish, 5 slabs of ice, 12 sacks of millet, 4 sacks of rice, and 2 sacks of beans.  While they get their supplies of fish from fishermen on the River Niger at the entrance of the Markala Dam, the grain is gotten from wholesale vendors at the weekly marketplace of Diamarabougou on Sundays.  If a portion of the fish is sold fresh (to women customers), the rest is smoked at home over traditional hearths designed especially for this, in order to be sold retail to bulk merchants, sometimes at the daily marketplace of Kirango Markala, in S\u00e9gou and in Bamako (the capital of Mali).  The grain is sold at the Diamarabougou marketplace to customers composed of women and men and generally in cash at the retail level. \r\n\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 32,000 francs CFA each month that will be used for covering the children's school fees and to help their husbands meet family expenses.

(Tricycles are the mode of transportation in their province.) \r\n\r\nCurrently, their tricycle is not working due to problems with the wheels and some spare parts that are not functioning. Her husband has started an art and sign printing business to earn an income while the tricycle is not working. She wants to repair the tricycle, so she needs PHP 5,000 for repair and maintenance. This will be her first loan from HSPFI and if it is granted, they can have a good and comfortable living.

A retired health technician, she came into commerce thanks to her mother, who used to sell grains.  She started her income-generating business with the knitting of clothing for children, commerce in various goods, etc.  \r\n\r\nShe very soon opted for making and selling local non-alcoholic juice drinks and ice cream.  She has been in this business for a dozen years and enjoys great fame in her area, and even in the city of S\u00e9gou.  To make juices, she uses 2 kg of sugar, 4 bags of juice powder, 6 bags of vanilla sugar, and some flavorings.  \r\n\r\nIn order to buy a large-capacity freezer for satisfying her customers, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso 36 months ago.  After four solidarity loans and an individual loan, all correctly repaid, she is now on her second individual loan.  This loan will be used to buy a freezer, locally in S\u00e9gou, from merchants who specialize in household appliances. \r\n\r\nMs. D. makes her sales out of her home and door-to-door, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of men, women, and children.  She intends to realize an average monthly profit of 37,000 francs CFA that will be put into savings and covering certain family expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Jypar has one son and one daughter. Both of her children go to college and don\u2019t work. At the age of 49, she works as a commander of the guard. She used to run a little farm. About a year ago she sold one calf and started selling summer hats. To spend $350 at once was a large sum for her, but she overcame her doubts and invested in hats. As a result, she earned around $200 and this allows her to pay for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nJypar has a desire to expand her business and to do that she needs a loan. With half of the loan she wants to buy men\u2019s and women\u2019s hats, and with the other half she wants to purchase children\u2019s Panama hats. She plans to get a container and achieve $1,200 turnover. As her children grow, so do her expenses for their education. Owning and running her own container would let her meet her growing needs. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Guljamal, Jailobai and Tojihon. Guljamal is 42. She has been selling women\u2019s clothes and has raised six children. Her spouse works as an unskilled laborer.

It was here we could talk with the client. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has been married for 14 years and has three children. She was born in Col\u00f3n and 5 years ago started selling Yanbal cosmetics from a catalog. Se\u00f1ora Mariuxi always has liked this business. Before she sold household items. The opportunity presented itself to start something new and with the help of her sister, she started selling Yanbal products. She learned this business and after started selling these products alone. \r\n<p>\r\nEvery month there are times when she must invest up to $500 in orders. Already she has regular clients who are very dependable in this part of the year with the most sales. \r\n<p>\r\nMariuxi is a very hard working woman who won\u2019t rest with this loan she is going to receive from the Foundacion. She is going to invest most of it in products and the other part in her boyo business (green bananas with noodles and beef) which is a typical dish from the Manab\u00ed zone. She, together with the aunt of her husband, have been working making this delicious dish for some time now. Her orders have reached 1300 bollos a week and this loan will help with these sales. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by karl baumgarten, Kiva

On average, each member receives Gs. 635,924 (approx. U$D 140) which will buy supplies and products that each member will sell in their respective business. \r\nThe hamlet's families are very poor, but still they have continued to survive and fulfill the needs that every family has thanks to the effort of the women who will take on any job to support and feed their children. \r\n\r\nThere are many women in this community like Mercedes, who is a single mother of three children. She currently collects materials to recycle, but with a loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, she was able to start a business selling \"empanadas\" (turnovers) at a street vending stand.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 230 tala or US $96 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Feri joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Feri's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Feri L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.23 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

A teacher by profession, Rustambek is also a farmer. Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Rustambek would like to expand his business into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of 10 000 Somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer to expand his crop. With part of the loan, he will buy young cattle. The income from it will help him cope with the needs of his large family. Rustambek is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has always repaid on time because she wants to continue to make progress.\r\n\r\nJulia plans to use the funds to buy larger amounts of natural products hoping thereby to obtain increased earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":566594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy natural products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":373.49},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":387.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":405.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":425.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":443.72},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":464.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":134.46,"local_amount":373.49,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":379.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673562},{"amount":139.33,"local_amount":387.04,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":393.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887381},{"amount":84.47,"local_amount":234.63,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":238.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154392},{"amount":61.35,"local_amount":170.43,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":173.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449694},{"amount":313.08,"local_amount":869.66,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":884.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588396},{"amount":167.31,"local_amount":464.75,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":472.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724889}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T20:41:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":217986,"name":"Mrs. Norm Ouch Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan has 19 people who live in Trapeang Dang Tuek village in Takeo province.

Leena wants to help her husband in purchasing some medical equipment for the laboratory, but the amount of money she has is not enough to pay for it.  So she needs to take a loan in the amount of $2,000 from FATEN.  When Leena gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, that will enable her to help her husband get the medical equipment.  This equipment will help to expand and improve his work and increase his income which will help to provide better life conditions for the family.  Leena is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in his laboratory.

The income she earns from this works provides her children with an education and helps to get more products to prepare and sell.  This is her first loan with the institution, and it will help her to be able to buy materials to diversify the range of products she offers her clients.  Investments like this have helped her in the past and will give her what is necessary to help her continue.  \r\n<P><B>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\nActualmente

In addition she makes and sells clothes such as g\u00fcipiles (traditional Guatemalan weavings) with specific designs from the area of San Pedro. \r\n\r\nShe originally started making and selling candles in San Pedro, where she lives, but then began to sell them in nearby towns like Chimaltenango, Pachalum, and San Antonio Aguas Calientes. When she has time, she always weaves at home. \r\n\r\nAs her business has grown, Marta sees the potential that more capital can offer. In spite of the economic situation, she has continued working hard and struggling, although her candle workshop still lacks many things. With her loan she will invest in purchasing materials such as wax, the basic material used to make the candles. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the cost of the thread that she uses to make the g\u00fcipiles has risen. She would like to use part of her loan to purchase thread in bulk so that she has enough materials to meet the demands of her clients who continue to place orders. Her goal is to continue moving forward so that she can provide for her children and improve their situation day by day. \r\n\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Andrea Bouch, Kiva Fellow\r\n\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Marta desde muy peque\u00f1a junto a su familia se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de candelas y veladoras tambi\u00e9n a la venta y elaboraci\u00f3n de tejidos como g\u00fcipiles San Pedranos. El tejido siempre lo hace en casa. El negocio elaborar y vender las candelas lo inicio en el pueblo de San Pedro donde ella vive, pero luego empez\u00f3 en otros pueblos como Chimaltenango, Pachalum, y San Antonio Aguas Calientes. Por tal motivo ve la necesidad de mas capital, a pesar de la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica siguen luchando pero faltan muchas cosas aun para invertir en el taller donde fabrican las candelas y veladores, necesita mas capital para comprar parafina que es el material b\u00e1sico para las candelas. Tambi\u00e9n el hilo para los g\u00fcipiles ha subido por tal motivo desea comprar mas ya que siempre sus manos no han descansado en hacerlos ya que tiene clientes que le hacen pedidos a quienes entrega lo que piden. Su meta es salir adelante para que sus hijos tengan lo necesario y que pueda mejorar cada d\u00eda. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":295162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Materials for candle-making and weaving","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2009-03-27T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980447},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44441245},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-22T09:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169028},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-26T08:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594358},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-24T09:04:31Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029826},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-20T09:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110796861},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118068281},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":761.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136665910},{"amount":76.88,"local_amount":615,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":624.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159753645},{"amount":163.14,"local_amount":1305.11,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1324.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172712582},{"amount":134.98,"local_amount":1079.89,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1096.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396361}],"funded_date":"2009-03-27T22:43:53Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":102434,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina is 49 years old and a resident of San Juan, Quirino, Isabela.
