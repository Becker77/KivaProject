They live in traditional families, are on average 40 years old, have seven children, and grow groundnuts, okra, and millet.\r\n\r\nIn the hopes of making their agricultural ventures more profitable, the members of the group decided to work with the credit program of Soro Yiriwaso, and are on their second loan of the year.\r\n\r\nFatouma, who is seated second from the right, intends to use her loan to purchase adequate quantities of groundnut seed and millet, small tools and agricultural inputs from the large market in Selefougou.

In July of 1993, she started selling clothing. Then she helped a neighbor selling perfumes. And starting in 1998, when for one of her daughters' birthday she created some flower arrangements, which were liked by all the guests, and so she was asked to create these products. Little by little, through recommendations of her excellent work, she has become well known in her community.<P>\r\nHowever, right now she has several orders she needs to make, and she does not have enough money or materials to make all of them. This is why Socorro is requesting a loan for US $650, which she is willing to pay in a period of 5 months. With this money Socorro will be able to cover all the orders she has, and save for school expenses.

Through his business, he was able to buy the house in which he and his family live. The business now generates enough income to cover his household expenses. He started working at 14, and by 21 he used his savings to buy machinery and set up his own carpentry shop. The customers from his old work followed him to his new business since he is very good at his trade. He currently has two employees who help him manufacture the furniture.

Bahrom is dedicated to the business of livestock. He distinguishes himself by having a lot of experience when it comes to livestock.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Fatu was born in Kabala and she is approximately forty-three years of age. She is married to a dealer in cigarettes and both of them have four children together. Two of their children are in colleges, one in secondary school and the other in primary school. Fatu sells rice, ground-nut\/peanuts, pepper, beans and palm-oil (the most popular cooking oil).

Every day she attends to her customers from 11:30am until 5pm.  Her vending stall is quite popular because of Rosa\u2019s excellent service and the good seasoning of the dishes she offers.\r\n<p>\r\nThis business enables her to remain active and generate income to support her family.  Her husband works as an assistant at the public university in the area.  With the money from both of their incomes, they are able to pay for their children\u2019s college education.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of the continuous demand that she experiences, Rosa believes she has to prepare more dishes to offer to her customers.  For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edypme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.  She will use the money to purchase supplies to continue preparing her dishes (rice, sugar, beans, oil, and noodles).  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest wish is to open a small grocery store in her home so that her family can continue to move forward.  Rosa is well-known and respected by her neighbors.  Her customers view her as a modest hardworking woman.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Myrna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Myrna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

town of Samana. This area is a nascent tourist zone, surrounded by the Atlantic ocean and mountains, rivers and natural breezes. Ramona says her most important challenge is to raise her children and guide them in a good way. She enjoys the kitchen and cooking.\r\n\r\nRamona is receiving her second loan from Esperanza Internacional, after having successfully repaid her previous loan.

Thi Nguyen joined the Fund in 2007.  Her family lives in a house facing a main street, which is very convenient for running a business.  She first joined the Fund to borrow money to invest in buying fruits to sell; at first she only sold small quantities to serve people in the area.  After one round of funding and seeing that the business had very high profits, she invested more money to expand the store with many more types of fruits.  Her husband buys and brings home the inventory of goods, and she runs the store and sells the fruits.  Besides sales at the store, she also sells to traders who supply the local markets around the area, and also has contracts to supply fruits for family gatherings, events, and ceremonies.  The family\u2019s finances are slowly improving and her is also very happy with their business.  She has two small school-age children.  In this round of funding she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to continue investing in the fruits business.

Previously, Mohamed received a loan of the same amount, Le 3,000,000.00, from Kiva through SMT.  He also used that loan to buy working materials. While the new loan amount remains the same, it will still enable him to make a better profit and consequently improve his living standard. Each time Mohamed makes profit, he reinvests part of the profit into the business and part of it into the house he is currently building."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":213050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict

Asatillo is 37 years old and married with four children. After he received a loan from IMON International, he witnessed an increased harvest for the first time in his life. With the loan, Asatillo expanded his vegetable-growing business. With the additional income from the harvest, Asatillo opened a small kiosk in his house where his family sells different foodstuff. Accordingly, his family\u2019s standard of living has improved. \r\n<p>\r\nNow he is seeking a loan of 2500 Somoni ($675 USD) to expand his farming operations, which will enable him to meet his targets for the coming season and, in turn, to generate additional income. \r\n<p> \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p> \r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p> \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p> \r\nIMON's History\r\n<p> \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 58 years old. Leocadia is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Leocadia owns & operates a fish-selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Leocadia is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leocadia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leocadia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Leocadia is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Leocadia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It usually begins with table-top selling and then grows to become a kiosk and eventually becomes supermarket. Helena is one of such entrepreneurs who have been trading in groceries like biscuits, bottled water, candies, can foods, rice, cooking oil, toiletries, etc., for the past three years. She sells in a metal store near her community market, hoping that, one day, she will be able to grow her business into a supermarket.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  fishing and the buying and selling of fish. Sulficia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sulficia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fishing business, will help her to continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and do home repairs.  Sulficia F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Pakistan and known for its dairy industry. She lives there with her family in a two-room brick house. She is married to G. M. and has no children.\r\n \r\nShe is a very talented lady who owns and operates her embroidery business at home. Earlier, she did this work to spend her time but later on she took it as a profession and now works on orders which she receives from different shops and from neighboring areas. She enjoys doing this work and earns well from it. Her earnings allow her to share the financial burden with her husband who operates a ready-made garment-selling business. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been dealing with his garment business for the last ten years. He has obtained a good reputation among his clients and serves them with quality clothes. He operates his shop in the market and deals with a good clientele base. \r\n \r\nAnweri has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, her husband will buy ready-made garments in bulk quantities for his business. The winter season has come and he will buy some winter clothes as well to provide a different variety to his customers. Anweri is hopeful that this investment will put more money in her husband\u2019s pocket and his business will become more profitable for him. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 3rd loan application. In previous loan years, she has responsibly paid her installments and attended every meeting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":626460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy ready-made garments for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Arifwala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.283333 73.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T12:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anweri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dano Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182495341},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630276},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191373183},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790615},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232445},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098865},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169268},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452012},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615967},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985095},{"amount":39.42,"local_amount":3320,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232743940}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T23:00:49Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:22:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":246334,"name":"Bester","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Bester N.  is currently in the business of selling coffee, cow peas, fish, beans, groundnuts etc  and is requesting a loan to stock more supplies of goods to sell.

Kahramon is a very responsible and optimistic person. He has three children and a wife who he has to support. His father is not working - only S. works in the family and is responsible for feeding them.\r\n\r\nKahramon began his working life in the catering field. His mother baked pies at home and he sold them in order to feed his family. Saving money, he began his business and got married. He has been in the clothing sales business for six years. \r\n\r\nKahramon is currently faced with many problems because as his children grow up, accordingly their expenses are growing too. He would like to get a loan of 11,000 Somoni to buy a place for his business. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities, along with the services provided by IMON International will help him improve the business.  \r\n\r\n<strong>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/strong>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and livestock business three years ago.  Ketut Tantri's husband is only a farmer who does not have enough income, because the land he works is not large.  From this marriage Ketut Tantri has two children but they are already married and live apart from Ketut Tantri.  With starting capital of Rp. 1,600,000, Ketut Tantri bought two sows.  One of them now has twelve children.  Two months after birth those piglets can be sold, and usually one piglet sells for Rp 200,000, but the plan is for five of these to be fattened up, leaving seven to be sold.  The income from the sale will be Rp.1,400,000 (@200,000 x &), of which Rp. 500,000 will be profit, which Ketut Tantri will use to improve her house although it is still very basic (semi-permanent).  Of the loan received from Dinari the plan is to use Rp.1,300,000 to buy feed because Ketut Tantri is now expanding her business to raise and fatten-up five piglets, in addition to the two sows, with the goal of increasing the profits.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nIbu Ni Ketut Tantri seorang ibu rumah tangga yang sangat ulet dan tekun terbukti untuk membantu perekonomian rumah tangganya Ketut Tantri menjalankan usaha memelihara ternak babi sejak 3 tahun yang lalu. Suami Ketut Tantri hanya sebagai seorang petani yang tidak mempunyai penghasilan cukup,karena ladang yang dikerjakannyapun tidak banyak,dari pernikahannya ini Ketut Tantri mempuyai 2 orang anak namun keduanya kini sudah menikah dan tinggal terpisah dengan Ketut Tantri.Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1.600.000 Ketut Tantri membeli 2 ekor babi penginduk. Dan salah satunya sekarang sudah mempunyai anak 12 ekor ,Setelah 2 bulan sejak lahir maka anak babi ini sudah bisa dijual ,Biasanya 1 ekor dijual seharga Rp.200.000,tetapi rencananya anak babi ini akan dipelihara sebagai babi penggemukan,sebanyak 5 ekor dan sisanya 7 ekor baru dijual. Dari hasil penjualan sebesar Rp.1.400.000 (@200.000 x 7) maka diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.500.000 , dari keuntungan inilah Ketut Tantri bisa memperbaiki rumahnya walaupun masih sangat sederhana (semipermanen) . Untuk pinjaman yang diperoleh dari dinari sebesar Rp.1.300.000 rencananya akan dipergunakan untuk membeli pakan ternak karena KetutTantri sekarang menambah usahanya dengan memelihara 5 ekor penggemukan disamping 2 ekor penginduk tadi,dengan harapan keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy livestock feed - Membeli pakan ternak","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-09T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Tantri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-23T05:57:55Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T10:21:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85550},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100241},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:10:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119042},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:16:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138501},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164261},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189316}],"funded_date":"2007-10-09T05:57:55Z","paid_date":"2008-04-23T09:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24247,"name":"Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Genoveva is 49 years old, married to Sixto Zarate, and they have 8 children: 7 are married and working while the youngest studies in school. <p>\r\n\r\nPreviously she worked in a tailor shop and with the time and experience she gained there, she opened her own tailor shop.

She earns income breeding pigs, while her husband, Mr. Em Lok, works as a motorbike-taxi driver, make very little. Mrs. S.'s business, on the other hand, is going well, and she wants to expand it. Therefore, Mrs. S. is asking for a loan to buy additional piglets for breeding. \r\nThis is a group loan mainly consisting of end-of-term loans. Three members of the group have end-of-term loans, while the others have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product, because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor, allowing them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term, and almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

At 37 years old, she still has great desire to continue working and helping her family. She lives in a house that was left to her by her parents. Zonia has one of the most well-stocked stores in her neighborhood. Her humble shop offers the groceries and household supplies most requested by the local population. She has had her shop for eight years and is very happy to sell products that meet the demands of her customers. The most difficult thing about her work is staying in her shop all day without being able to leave, as her store is open all day and she must be available to serve her customers whenever they call. In the future, Zonia would like to expand her business to provide more products, as her neighborhood is growing and her current supply of merchandise is not enough.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Zonia's fifth loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, and all of her previous loan were repaid punctually and without problems.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This way her earnings will grow, and she will get more customers because she will have what it takes to cover their necessities.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":383411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Invest in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2009-09-05T16:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96950160},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103792305},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683033},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077607},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913849},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949512},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678357},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712797},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152048141},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636700}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T01:09:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":139011,"name":"Bukorakole Nyangoma Beatrice Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

Durante toda su vida ha trabajado en diversidad de labores, pero hace 3 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 incursionar en un negocio que le diera la ventaja de ser independiente. Es as\u00ed que explotando sus habilidades culinarias, que es lo que su familia siempre ha alabado, en asociaci\u00f3n con una amiga implement\u00f3 dos puestos de comida en una de las calles m\u00e1s concurridas de su localidad. Ahora, Ana viene obteniendo buenos ingresos realizando una actividad que le gusta mucho y tiene en mente para el futuro tener un restaurante donde ofrezca con mayor comodidad sus ricos platillos, ya que actualmente tiene dificultades de espacio, pues sus puestos son muy concurridos.

The inspiration of maintaining her excellent performance in ASHI since the time of her membership is drawn from the four most significant blessing she received from GOD. These are her four children whose age ranges are from 10 to 20 years old.  Despite of poverty and small family income, Ana and her family give love and respect to each other. While her husband manages and working in their small business which is a vehicle (particularly motorcycle) repair shop, at home Ana does the household chores and is taking care of their children. \r\n\r\nAs her children grew old their family expenses also increases hence, Ana and her husband wanted to enhance their small business through a loan for a capital. Because Ana and her husband are just poor, no one in their village would trust them for a loan. With that, Ana joined ASHI and had found the answer to her problem. Since then, she made her business grow anyhow but not yet to the extent of achieving her dream of making it sustainable. Ana and her husband still want to buy more equipments and machines necessary for the business to improve their efficiency, to improve the quality of service they can give and be able to have more costumers. Therefore she still asks for a much larger amount of loan for its fulfillment.

She shares her life with her husband, Ivan, 65, and they live together in their own home. Since they were both very young the couple has worked selling artesanal goods, an activity that their 2 children have inherited, having now established their own stall and working at the same activity. The most frequent work Consuela and Ivan do is making very large statues of saints for Christmas and for churches and chapels. Apart from this, Consuela also has her own business selling small statues of the baby Jesus, which she sells by order. This is less work because of the statues' size, but this doesn't mean it's less difficult as the statues are very detailed - putting in place the mix into the moulds and closing them with great precision so that both sides are in harmony and the image is modelled well. Later the moulds are sculpted and given the finishing touches necessary. This is the couple's third loan with MFP, and as usual they will be very punctual with the repayments. With this loan they will purchase the materials necessary to finish the orders that they have waiting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":558093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase material to make statues to fill an order ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Consuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":123.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":141.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":152.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":165.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":172.1},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.51},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":128.82,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":133.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673485},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":130.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887304},{"amount":48.66,"local_amount":132.72,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":137.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154315},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":141.4,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449613},{"amount":52.93,"local_amount":144.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":149.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588314},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":154.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724816},{"amount":244.56,"local_amount":666.97,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":691.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463005}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T01:47:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":213565,"name":"Julio Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio Alberto tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el Municipio de Chilanga del departamento de Moraz\u00e1n, es acompa\u00f1ado tiene dos hijos, y actualmente vive solo con su compa\u00f1era de vida, el se dedica a la venta de CD.\nTiene siete a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la venta de CD de m\u00fasica, y los comercializa en los municipios y zonas cercanas de su residencia, emprendi\u00f3 su negocio por la necesidad econ\u00f3mica y la falta de empleo.\nJulio est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de CD, y seguir con su negocio  ya que de las ventas depende la econom\u00eda de su familia, sus aspiraciones son tener un lugar propio donde vivir, ahorrar para comprar un terreno.\n","en":"Julio Alberto is 52 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

O. is a married man. His wife is a greengrocer and they have one child, aged three years old, whom they hope to educate to the university level.

He provides public transport around the busy Kisumu city. He has been in this business for five years now and has one employee. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is the high cost of repairing the rickshaw. There is also increased thuggery in the area posing risk to his business and life. However he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to buy spare parts to repair the rickshaw, so it will stay in good condition to provide better service to his clients. He hopes to acquire another rickshaw in the future to increase his income.

This is why Mayja, with the first loan she received from Manuela Ramos of 300 nuevos soles, decided to invest in buying and selling fruit.<p>\r\nCurrently, she has an Internet cafe, which she attends to with her children, who help her.  She also shares the household chores with them so they can then open their business and devote their attention to their clients.  With this loan of 1,000 nuevos soles, which she will repay in 6 months, she will buy a computer, a monitor, a keyboard, a printer, and their respective installation so she can supply her business and have a larger clientele.  Mayja is very happy because her business is attracting a lot of customers.  Her income is increasing along with the well-being of herself and her children, who are her reason for living.

In order to continue this she is asking for a loan from Manuela Ramos for 300 soles. She currently has a mini manufacturing company located in her home where she is supported by her father who directs the work. Liz focuses on caring for her clients all day long from 8am to 6pm; in the morning she gets up at 6am and does household chores until it is time to care for her business.

She is married and has two children, 18 and 20 years old.  Since 2000, Fatuma has been earning income selling snacks on the street. She sells items such as samosas (meat and\/or vegetables wrapped in a thin dough and deep fried) and vitafunwa (slightly sweetened, poofy, deep-fried pancakes made of rice flour). Fatuma works 1 to 4 hours a day, 6 days a week. Currently, she needs a loan of US$250 in order to purchase additional raw materials, including flour, in order to increase her production. Fatuma thanks everyone for their support.\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of ingredients for a food-sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-22T09:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970730},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886947},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436207},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130480},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027282},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613305},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010388},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232699},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664515}],"funded_date":"2008-11-22T17:28:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77534,"name":"Sokha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokha T., 45, and her husband, Mr. Vit Ses, 47, live along national road number one about seventeen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

Nazokat is 35 years old. She is married with three children. Nazokat has a tailoring business at her home. Her business is sewing a national raincoat called \u201cChapan\u201d for men and women. Her workmanship is very good and she has a good eye for design. She is very organized and has a good head for business. \r\n<p>\r\nNazokat has had this business for 10 years and this is her fifth loan from IMON International.

She quickly replies that she plans to open a workshop, hire seamstresses, and expand her business. With her spirit, she will surely succeed.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in their own house in a quiet area of the Peruvian mountains.\r\nFrom an early age, Maria learned that success comes only through hard work and dedication. She worked as a traveling sales representative; however, she was mortified to discover that her children's grades were beginning to fall, so she decided to set up a business in her own house. She opened a small restaurant in her own living room, which is spacious and ideal for this purpose. She also sells groceries, so on the same premises she has two very profitable businesses, since there is no competition in the area.\r\nMaria has had this business for over a year; things are going well and she is very satisfied with the results. Moreover, on weekends she serves breakfasts with the help of her husband, who takes over the business when she has to go out.\r\nThis is her seventh loan from MFP and she is very happy with the support she has received; she promises to repay punctually. Maria also considers that the community bank is very important for everyone to succeed and improve their situation. She plans to invest the money in a new business with her husband: a tire store, where they will sell and change tires. They are determined to work hard to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by John Rynne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":452983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest in a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-20T09:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":34.72,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960055},{"amount":590.28,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153768}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T21:15:13Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"John Rynne","image":161916}},{"id":167937,"name":"Jaafar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jaafar is a 34-year-old married man with one unemployed child.

Nanca, E.B. Magalona, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: buying and selling livestock and a general store. Her husband Raymund, who is 49 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 4 children who are 2 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nRuby joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruby has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use as funds for her business operations so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Ruby L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. In the photo you will see Ruby together with her sons and a carabao that is ready to be sold.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

El negocio comenz\u00f3 hace cuatro a\u00f1os cuando el esposo de la microempresaria qued\u00f3 desempleado luego de trabajar por m\u00e1s de veinte a\u00f1os en el ramo de la fibra de vidrio. En un principio las ventas eran bajas, pero fueron aumentando gracias a la labor de promoci\u00f3n y mercadeo de la se\u00f1ora Fany. Hoy sus productos gozan de un gran prestigio debido  a la calidad de los mismos; son tan buenos que ella otorga dos a\u00f1os de garant\u00eda, mientras que la competencia da s\u00f3lo 18 meses. Los m\u00e1s importantes clientes del negocio son otras empresas que reciben contratos grandes del sector p\u00fablico o privado para construir parques infantiles y ellos a su vez sub contratan con microempresas como la de la se\u00f1ora Fany. Ella es quien maneja la parte administrativa y comercial, su esposo se encarga de la parte operativa, pero cuando los pedidos aumentan considerablemente no es raro verla con guantes y mascarilla pintando con soplete los productos. Este es el segundo pr\u00e9stamo que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra al por mayor de fibra de vidrio, resina, catalizadores y pinturas. Con el primer cr\u00e9dito compr\u00f3 nuevos moldes y herramientas. Cuando los pedidos de piezas para parques infantiles disminuyen, la microempresaria tambi\u00e9n produce guarda barros para autom\u00f3viles, lava cabezas para peluquer\u00edas, toboganes para piscinas y jacuzzis para ba\u00f1os. Ella en general produce cualquier objeto en fibra de vidrio, pero lo que m\u00e1s le gusta fabricar son piezas para parques infantiles porque, seg\u00fan su esposo, eso equivale a producir felicidad a los ni\u00f1os de Colombia.","en":"Fany G. G. is 38 years old and lives with her husband and two children in El Tesoro neighborhood, in the city of Bogot\u00e1.  She has a workshop where she makes products from fiberglass such as slides, tunnels and seesaws for children's playgrounds.\r\n\r\nFany started her business four years ago when her husband lost his job after having worked for more than twenty years in the fiberglass industry.  At first, her sales were low but they increased thanks to her work promoting and marketing the business.  Today her products enjoy great prestige owing to their quality.  The quality of her products is so good that she offers her customers a two year guarantee whilst her competition only offer 18 months.\r\n\r\nFany's most important customers are companies who receive large contracts, in the public or private sector, to build children's playgrounds.  They, in turn, sub contract small businesspeople such as Fany.  Fany manages the administrative and commercial side of the business.  Her husband is in charge of the manufacturing side.  However, when orders increase considerably it isn't unusual to see Fany with her gloves and mask on, spray painting the products.\r\n\r\nThis is Fany's second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying fiberglass, resin, catalysts and paints wholesale.  She used her first loan to buy new molds and tools.  When the orders for children's playgrounds slow down, this small businesswoman also produces mudguards for cars, sinks for hairdressing salons, slides for swimming pools and jacuzzis for baths.  In general, she produces any object in fiberglass but what she most likes making are items for children's playgrounds because, according to her husband, this means they are producing happiness for the

Esperamos que usted pueda ayudarle a do\u00f1a Virgen a realizar su negocio."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":182196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To rent a shop area for the sale of clothing and to buy supplies for a juice stand","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-07-21T18:50:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virgen Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-06T04:37:49Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":117.6,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318114},{"amount":42,"local_amount":117.6,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-07T07:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":120.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350004},{"amount":41,"local_amount":114.81,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":117.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335406},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":119.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956584},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":119.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226839},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":116.65,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":119.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422083}],"funded_date":"2008-07-23T04:37:49Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61147,"name":"Farrukh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farrukh A. is 24 years old.

It's her way of life and, thanks to her business, she's been able to educate her children.  She started in March 1990, setting up a food vending business with help from her father and selling on the street, at first.  Later, she set up a cafeteria in a school where she operates now.  The cafeteria can be reached from both inside the school so that she can serve the school's students and from outside so that she can serve people coming in from the street.  Her business has grown steadily from the start.  She bought a small truck so that she could better supply the business and, with the earnings, she was able to buy another truck so that she now has two.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe needs a MXN$5300 loan to buy

She is 43 years old and lives with her common-law husband. She has five children between the ages of 13 and 25. They are all in school except the middle daughter, who is already employed in education.\r\n\r\nMafalda and her father left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland while she was still a child. Her father worked at the Montemor mineral water company, and died on the job. The company then hired one of his children, and since she was the eldest she had the opportunity to work to help support her family. Today she has been an employee there for 24 years, alternating between a day shift from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and a night shift from 3:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. She earns 2129 meticals a month, not enough to cover her basic expenses, since she lives in a rental house that costs 500 meticals a month. But with the help of her husband, who works as a border guard, they manage to scrape by. Because of the high cost of construction materials they have not been able to finish building their house. Her husband had to apply for a 34,000-metical loan from a bank (BIM) to continue the work, and it still remains unfinished. She learned about our services in a conversation with coworkers, and came to us to request a loan of 10,000 meticals to finish part of the house and be able to move into their own home.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Luaipoualii has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 200 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luaipoualii joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Luaipoualii is requesting  a loan from SPBD for the first time.  The 1000 WST loan will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.   Luaipoualii plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

For the past few years, he has made his living as a professional driver, operating a car service for customers in his village as well as neighboring towns. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l.  to perform maintenance work on his vehicle. He reports that these improvements will enable him to provide his service to more passengers and earn more income, especially during the summer season when there are many passengers going to Lebanon.<p>\r\n\r\nIn Lebanon, it is common to use taxi services to go between neighborhoods in a given town as well as to travel between different regions. These services are especially important in areas where the infrastructure is less developed, which is true for most of the towns outside of Beirut and its surrounding suburbs.<p>\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).  Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support of Lebanon's borrowers.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l.,a Lebanese services company, in 2003.

They have lived together in a 'ger' (traditional Mongolian tent home) on a small plot of land they own for several years. His two sons, ages 12 and 8, attend a local school while his wife works as a cook in a restaurant. \r\n\r\nSosorbaram operates a meat trading business at Huchit Shonhor market, the largest meat supply market in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. He has operated this business for the last 3 years and has found much success with his new business. He usually purchases his meats from the countryside and sells it at the Huchit Shonhor market as a wholesaler. Also he sells meat through meat shops in the rural areas as a retailer.  \r\n\r\nBefore starting his own business, he was a herder between 1992 and 2002 and worked as an assistant in the meat shop at the Har horin, a big market in the city from 2002 to 2004. His business was successful enough to purchase a new house and fence for his family. Moreover, his earnings have enabled him to buy a new small car as well as a van for his business. \r\n\r\nHe is planning to establish his own meat processing factory in a building that he purchased out of his earnings. Sosorbaram is a very modest, honest and hard-working man. \"My only goal is to open my own meat processing factory and export a variety of processed meats on the foreign market,\" he says. He is requesting a 3,000,000 MNT loan for his meat trading business.

To one side of the photo you can see the 'lechones' (young pigs) which she puts a lot of effort into raising.  She raises and sells pigs and started her business  10 years ago.  She is requesting this loan to buy feed for her pigs.  Her customers prefer to buy their pigs from her because she provides them with high quality and clean meat.  Right now she is happy about this new loan because she plans to invest in the building of more pigsties (where the pigs are raised).  She is 51 years old and studied up to the third year of elementary school.  She is married and has one daughter.  She hopes that with the building of the pigsties she will have more space to increase her production.

She is married and has three children. Barnokhon is engaged in an animal husbandry and has been running this business for 8 years.  She also grows apricots. Currently, her husband is working in Russia and sends his family 200-300 USD every month. Barnokhon would like to get a loan of 5,400 TJS to expand her land for apricot farming.  She has received 2 cycles of loans from Imon International and has a good credit history.\r\n    \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
