After he fully matured, he left farming in the village for the city. In the city, he helped to sell for somebody on commission where he accumulated some funds, which he used to start his own business.

He felt good about taking this loan and the loan will help him to improve his business and his family's standard of living.  His major challenge is that sometimes the bales he buys contain spoiled\/damaged clothing. He serves 15 customers each day. His business is popular because he sells quality used clothing. Lamin does not have any employees. His suppliers are located in Conakry and he transports his good by public transport. He buys three times in a month.  He plows back the profit into the business.

This will allow to to stock her sales stall well while at the same time keeping her clients well satisfied. <p>She is 56 years old with 12 children, now all adults.

Joined together by family and neighborhood ties, the women decided to establish a partnership with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. They are now on their tenth loan and all previous loans have been reimbursed without problems. The current loan will allow them to buy 20 bags of corn and peanuts, 400 kg of onions (fresh and dried), and a significant amount of seasonings. The grain retailers get their supplies on-site (especially on Tuesdays, market day) in Yanfolila from producers coming from surrounding villages. The seasoning sellers get their supplies each week in Sikasso from wholesalers in that area. These items are resold as retail, for cash, and sometimes on credit to customers who are mostly women from the town of Yanfolila. From their business activities, each member of the group hopes to make a profit of 50,000 FCFA per loan cycle, which will allow them to repay interest and meet certain household needs such as children's education, healthcare, and clothing.

Luisa is 38 years old and lives with her partner and their five children, who are 13, 11, 6, 3, and 9 months old. Luisa works as a cook for the local Municipal. She cooks for Wawawasi (\u201cBaby house\u201d in Quechua), its childcare program, preparing meals for 11 babies and 55 children each day. She cooks alone, though she works with two people who help her serve the food. She cooks mostly stews.\r\n\r\nLuisa also raises small animals like pigs, guinea pigs and hens at her home. Right now, she has one pig and 30 to 40 guinea pigs (a Peruvian delicacy). She raises the animals from the time they are small, then fattens them up and sells them to buyers, who travel to Andahuaylillas from Cusco and bring the animals back to the city to cook and serve in restaurants. Luisa is requesting a loan of 1800 soles to buy hens and guinea pigs. Hens cost 12.50 soles per pair, and guinea pigs cost 22 soles per pair. She expects to sell the hens for 40-45 soles apiece and the guinea pigs for 20-25 soles apiece in three to four months. Though hens sell for more when fully grown, they also cost more to feed and maintain, Luisa says. \r\n\r\nLuisa\u2019s goal for the future is to open a chain of hotels in Andahuayllillas. She says there are many tourists who visit the small town to see its church (which is nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sistine Chapel\u201d because of the elaborate 17th century frescos painted on its walls and ceiling), and she sees a promising business opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":305544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy hens and guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Andahuaylillas - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":271.37},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":282.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":293.51},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":305.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":317.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":330.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.84},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.46,"local_amount":271.37,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":280.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409840},{"amount":94.1,"local_amount":282.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918287},{"amount":97.85,"local_amount":293.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":303.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139126},{"amount":101.76,"local_amount":305.28,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":315.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564746},{"amount":105.84,"local_amount":317.51,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:09:24Z","rounded_local_amount":328.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998337},{"amount":109.99,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":341.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910604}],"funded_date":"2009-05-02T23:56:50Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:40:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":106706,"name":"Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb H\u1ea3i Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"H.

The work is very difficult because it requires long hours of labor in the blazing sun.  She goes on, despite this, because she knows that the business provides the living that supports her family.  Martina wants to continue improving her production and, in the future, set up another business.  This is her first MFP loan and she's very much looking forward to learning about and being part of a community bank, a new experience for her.  The money that she's requesting will be used to purchase bags and to pay to transport the potatoes that she will harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":334861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pay for bags and transportation for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-12T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211861},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641388},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080827},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996968},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842307},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":89.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733910}],"funded_date":"2009-06-12T20:07:12Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":118994,"name":"Rizal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizal J. is 33 years old and has two children.

She owns a business venture, selling BBQ (sausages, chicken, plantains).  Sapani has many years of experience in this business.  Sapani needs a loan of WST $2000 to buy BBQ meat, ketchup, plastic plates & utensils, and coal.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business. Sapani wishes to develop her business and support her family.\r\n\r\nSapani joined SPBD, and this is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sapani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapani S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Fofo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Fofo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Fofo joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fofo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With her partner she has 3 grown children, two of whom work and help their parents with the household expenses.  The youngest is in high school and is economically dependent.  Herminda and her partner have had a general store for more than 7 years.  Due to the economic problems that are affecting the country, her sales are variable.

Now she requests a loan to buy a greater quantity of merchandise for her business to ensure an increase in her sales so that she can support her daughter's education.\n\nThis is Herminda's 3rd loan cycle, and with the support that has been provided to her she has shown great economic improvement.

Zulfiya has a small trade outlet at the regional central market, where she deals in household cleaners.  Her neighbors do not need to go to town for laundry powder, soap, etc.  They know that they can buy all that not far from home.

Lizbeth likes her job for the independence it provides her and because she can help her mother with household expenses.  Sales are very good and she is able to sell each jacket at a good price.  Demand for her goods is increasing which is why Lizbeth would like to increase her sales, buying more jackets that she can sell during the Christmas season.  This is her first loan from Microfinanzas Prisma and she is committed to making her payments on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":234624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase the stock of jackets to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T02:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizbeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957797},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228047},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423279},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116535},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011478},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":154.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595110}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T23:14:00Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":82146,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 43-year old married man with two children, living in his village Al Kfour in Nabatieh in southern Lebanon.

One of his selling strategies is to place himself next to vendors who sell toys in the market, since these spots are the most visited by his potential clients. He also walks the streets of the market selling his product and he looks for ways to sell out to improve his earnings.

Constant is a trained furniture maker, but he's happy to run this business because it provides him with financial means to support his family. He started his business in 1996 with an initial capital of $25, selling corn and  cassava. In 2003, after years of hard work, determination, and, most importantly, good management, he succeeded in achieving a $600 capital. This amount enabled him to buy two used ovens to cook cookies. His capital now amounts to $270, and his business turns a monthly profit of $120. His ambition is to one day open a bakery, because demand for it is very high. Constant is well known in his field, thanks to the quality of his products. He's married and the father of 2 children, age 10 and 14, who both attend school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":324375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy 5 boxes of soap, 1 sack of sugar, and canned food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

With the profits of this new investment she plans to pay back her loan, as her husband, Mr. Gilberto Reyna, will pay for household expenses with the income from his work as a Maintenance Supervisor for a transportation company.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Isabel French, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":424946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nuevo Laredo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"27.5 -99.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T02:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":879.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683179},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":879.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077743},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":879.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913988},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":879.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949648},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":879.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678474},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":879.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712905}],"funded_date":"2009-11-12T19:24:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":156070,"name":"Francisco Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Francisco Javier Z\u00fa\u00f1iga C. tiene la edad de 45 a\u00f1os habita en la comunidad el Ed\u00e9n ubicado en el municipio de Ticuantepe, junto a su esposa la cual le ayuda con las cosas del hogar y en los cultivos, ellos tienen a su cargo tres hijos dos j\u00f3venes que estudian su secundaria y un  peque\u00f1ito de cuatros a\u00f1os, los planes hacia su familia es mejorar las condiciones de vida ya que su casa esta construida de madera y quiere que en un futuro se le apoye para construir su vivienda , el desde hace 30 a\u00f1os se dedica a la agricultura la mayor dificultad que se le ha presentado es la falta de financiamiento ya que sus cultivos carecen de fertilizantes e insumos , el inicio con sus propios esfuerzos para poder mantener su a su familia , el quiere financiamiento para la compra de insumos el cual aplicara al cultivo","en":"Mr. Francisco Javier Z\u00fa\u00f1iga C. is 45 years old and lives in el Ed\u00e9n, located in the municipality of Ticuantepe.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

F. is 35 and married with 4 children (ages 1 - 6).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ofa has 2 years of experience in this business.  Ofa needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Ofa joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ofa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 49 years old. Susana is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Susana owns & operates a business making and selling snacks & other delicacies, especially cinnamon bread, in the local community. Susana is just starting this business because she finds that she is earning more in this cinnamon business than in a retail store.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Susana joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Susana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Susana is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Susana from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This is the environment in which 71-year old Lilia Esther C. and her family work. They live very close to a place called \u201cLa Cascada\u201d where political meetings and activities like Mothers Day celebrations are held. All these visitors have a beneficial impact on Lilia\u2019s sales of general goods and soft drinks. At the moment she has no refrigeration system as her freezer has broken down, so she wishes to replace it. For this reason she is asking for her third loan with Kiva partner, the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.\r\n\r\nLilia Esther is a widow and has seven children aged 33 to 59 years. In her twenties she moved from Cartagena to Banrranqullia with her 2-year old daughter and the dream of increasing her income. At first she worked as a domestic servant. Some time later she got married and had her other children. She bought her first house and began cooking and selling food such as soup, hayacas (meat wrapped in cornmeal dough and banana leaves), and fried items. Later she bought a larger house in Santa Mar\u00eda where she has lived now for 35 years. Lilia is a role model with her business drive and her well-mannered seven children. While she was bringing them up, she taught them honesty and the value of work. \r\n\r\nEncouraged by her daughter (who is also a client of the Foundation), about three years ago Lilia learned more about its programs and since that time has had two loans. She has used the money to expand her business and thus earn more money to cover household expenses. Her dream is that those of her children who do not yet have a home of their own will one day have their own house. Her goal is to make some physical changes to her business. High and low seasons give her some problems as her income is higher at certain times of the year. During those times she has to work harder and make sure she saves money for the tough times so she has enough to live on and not cause problems for anyone.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory.

At 50, Petronila M. tries her best to minimize the uncertainties in her business and in her personal life. Petronila is married to Gabriel, who works as a driver. They live in Dasmarinas, Cavite, where they raise their four children. One of them is in college while another one is in elementary. They have a child who already works for a living, and one who stays at home.\r\n\r\nPetronila is a dealer of charcoal and wood as cooking fuel, applying her learning from the training CCT* provides to its community partners. She buys sacks of it and repacks it into small packs worth Php 10. This she does to make it affordable to people in her community who often use it for cooking. With these, she earns an estimated net income around Php 10,000 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a Php 8,000 loan. She plans to use this to buy more sacks of charcoal and bundles of woods as fuel to boost her business. She looks forward to an increased income due to this effort.\r\n\r\nCustomers and financial matters will always be a concern for her, but Petronila knows that God has given her the ability to produce wealth; the first step is to believe, and the next one is to take action.

For the last 20 years, he has driven thousands of kilometers transporting passengers all around the city and at times around the country. Abdumajid started as a taxi driver because he was unable to find another good job. He makes about $15 in a typical day, which is enough to support himself, his wife and two children. Abdumajid has requested a loan of $1,000 USD to make some repairs to his car engine. One of the drawbacks to being a taxi driver is the potential for costly repair overhead. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Carmela and her family live in their own house in the community of Teresa in the District of Pichari.  She is a young woman with great enthusiasm and creativity.  Carmela started working with wood more than five years ago along with her husband, who is the engine that drives their family.  The furniture they produce is in great demand among their customers.  Their designs are attractive and are offered for a low price.  Carmela enjoys her work, but what irritates her is not having the necessary tools since she lacks a few items.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, she approached MFP to request a loan to help her become more efficient in producing her furniture.  This is her first loan with MFP and she promises to complete her payments on time.  The loan of 1000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy carpentry tools.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":841341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy carpentry tools.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Malia Paula joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She used to live in her parents' house in the municipality of San Jacinto. Before she used to sew with her sisters and also take care of children in a community house, endorsed by the national government. Through her own effort and supported by the state, she has managed to get ahead and now has her own house and a new business that supports her in generating revenue and seeking a better lifestyle for her family daily. In addition to sewing clothes, she sells soft drinks, sodas, beers which shopkeepers and other businesses buy icecold to sell. Also as she knows how to bake, she also sells desserts at special times commisioned by neighbours and people they know and recommend. So when you speak with her she is filled with enthusiasm because she says she lacks for nothing and this is thanks to her judicious and orderly work and above all to her family who she appreciates for never having abandoned her. \r\n\r\nHer dream of growth is often cut short because her capital is insufficient to meet clients' needs. This is why she has come for funding to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, the first loan with Kiva and with which she will buy soft drinks in large quantities to reduce costs and be provisoned for December when her sales rally. Likewise she will buy a cooler as the fridge where she cools the soft drinks is insufficient to meet the great demand and fabric to fill a few orders for children's clothing.\r\n\r\n   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":909013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabrics, soft drinks and a cooler.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T09:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":54805},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":59817},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":61213},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":62641},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64103},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":65599},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":67129},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":68695},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":70298},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71939},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":73617},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":80144}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.83,"local_amount":54805,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":57586.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780307},{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":59817,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":62852.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188692},{"amount":34.44,"local_amount":61213,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":64319.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324905},{"amount":35.23,"local_amount":62641,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":65820.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038962},{"amount":36.06,"local_amount":64103,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":67356.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651113},{"amount":36.9,"local_amount":65599,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68928.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386662},{"amount":97.16,"local_amount":172729,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":181495,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130898},{"amount":145.74,"local_amount":259093,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":272241.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347071768}],"funded_date":"2011-11-15T21:01:38Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:09:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":357575,"name":"Yuvinalis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yuvinalis is 49 years old.

There she has a varied business, selling merchandise from her home. She started this business with a loan from a friend, and her business is now her job. For this reason, her greatest dream is to expand it and make more income from it. Her goal for the future is to make it a large store, where her customers will find everything they need. Her greatest challenge is a lack of working capital to respond to her growing customer demand. Every day her customers are excited to see her products.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The main office in the Andes is one of the oldest in the El Alto Region, with the Chulumani being one of the longest standing communal associations, having had 25 loan cycles with Pro Mujer (approximately twelve and a half years).  The businesses that the members conduct are: the sale of footwear, baby clothes, woven sweaters and blankets, canned goods, juices and refreshments, macrame items, cheese and salt, and a grocery store.  Mrs. Agustina Elena R. is 42 years old and married with three children (2 girls and 1 boy).  She has a blanket weaving business during her free time and has been traveling to the cities of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz these past two years, taking school supplies along with her.  This business began under the advice of her sister, whom already had experience in the development of this type of economic activity.  Nevertheless, these haven't been the only economic activities that Agustina has undertaken.  During the 24 loan cycles that she has been a member of Pro Mujer, she has developed different businesses according to the opportunities that have been presented to her. \r\n<br

He is married to Ernestina, 31 years old; they have 3 beautiful children and live together in their own home in the community of Ranramayo, a hamlet in the Santa Rosa district. Jaimer is the breadwinner for his family; he works in agriculture and has been working the land since he was 18 years old. His land contains cocoa and coffee plantations, with plants that are native to the R\u00edo Apurimac Valley woodlands. At harvest time he needs a helping hand from contracted day laborers in order to proceed with harvesting  the beans. For him, the best part of his job is harvesting the beans from the plant; a time when he feels that the quality of his beans makes the months of hard work worthwhile. He believes that the hardest part of his job is transporting his produce from the farm to the warehouses located in the district of San Francisco, where he is offered better prices for his coffee and cocoa beans. In the future, he wishes to buy new lands and sow more cocoa plants using more modern methods so that he can produce organic cocoa. This is his tenth loan with MFP; he feels that this support will greatly help him to continue with his work, and he is wiling to comply punctually with his repayment schedule. He will use the 3000 Nuevo Soles to contract workers to harvest the coffee beans.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":717268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To employ day laborers to help him harvest coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaimer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":247.79},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":210.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":226.49},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":237.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":241.06},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":253.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":262.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":270.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":281.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":290.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":255.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.3},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.21},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.09},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.08,"local_amount":248.4,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":251.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327756},{"amount":77.83,"local_amount":212.27,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":215.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196279},{"amount":87.17,"local_amount":237.73,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":240.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269960},{"amount":81.77,"local_amount":223.01,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:57Z","rounded_local_amount":226.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549974},{"amount":85.79,"local_amount":233.98,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":237.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718653},{"amount":88.17,"local_amount":240.47,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":243.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350074},{"amount":95,"local_amount":259.09,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":262.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850626},{"amount":91.18,"local_amount":248.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":252.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665853},{"amount":104.31,"local_amount":284.49,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":288.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621025},{"amount":103,"local_amount":280.91,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":284.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835222},{"amount":194.7,"local_amount":530.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":538.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245018}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T00:52:59Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caroline Reiss","image":798183}},{"id":279693,"name":"Necole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Necole is a married woman who lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental.

Necole joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Necole has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13, 000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs.

Having not attended modern school, he has been working for a living since he was young. For years, he has been buying and selling fish, but this business has never truly appealed to him. This is why three years ago, he decided to change his business to buy and sell oxen. He learned how to conduct this business from a friend.

She also hopes through this work to improve her living conditions in the future and to feel more comfortable with what God has given her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":943483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy drinks to chill and sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T15:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":78294},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":80121},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":81991},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83904},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85862},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87865},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":89915},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":92013},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":94160},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96357},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":98606},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100912}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.44},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":78294,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":80908.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188803},{"amount":43.06,"local_amount":80121,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":82796.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325006},{"amount":44.06,"local_amount":81991,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":84728.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039068},{"amount":45.09,"local_amount":83904,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":86705.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651209},{"amount":400.72,"local_amount":745690,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":770586.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993637}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T01:17:31Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":373978,"name":"Avtandil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Avtandil lives in the village of Kandaura, East Georgia with his family, wife Nanuli, son and a daughter-in-law.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

They live in traditional polygamist families in the Sogomougou neighborhood in the city of Koutiala (third economic region of Mali). They run different businesses, notably in the sale of construction wood, food-service (exclusively at night), etc. United by profession, neighborhood, and age, in trying to grow their businesses, the group members decided to use microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program, which they have been doing for two years. They are on their third group loan, and their first two were repaid without difficulty. The current loan will be used to buy a truckload of construction wood, a bag of beans, boxes of macaroni, and a large quantity of ingredients for their food-service business. They stock up in Koutiala\u2019s neighboring villages from forest farmers for the construction wood and at the city\u2019s big market for the ingredients for the nocturnal food-service. Building entrepreneurs are the principal clients of the construction wood. On the other hand, the food-service clientele is diversified because of the proximity of the location to an area frequented by night owls. They hope to earn 80,000 CFA francs each per cycle, which they foresee using to make loan payments and meet the ongoing needs of their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":193371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase construction wood and ingredients for food-service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-09-06T02:30:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-20T14:26:36Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":66766.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":366874},{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":66766.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350896},{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":66766.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9973959},{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":66766.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889332},{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":66766.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440127},{"amount":150,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":66766.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135496}],"funded_date":"2008-09-06T14:26:36Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":65798,"name":"Luz Y Vida Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Luz y Vida (Light and Life) group is made up of 13 people, of whom four are men and nine are women.

Twenty years ago, she worked selling food, but it was a very difficult job for her so eight years ago she started selling beauty products.  She tells us that the business is going well and overall she earns very encouraging margins on her products since her customers pay her well and on time.  About two years ago, she decided to set up a business selling clothing, but she earns more selling perfumes and jewelry from very well-known catalogues.  About four months ago, she took over the responsibility of taking care of her niece's daughter (for which she earns a bit of money) but now her difficulty is that she has to carry the girl as she walks around selling her products.  This is her 5th loan from Prisma Microfinance and she will use the money to buy perfumes.

One of his children is currently in school, while his other child is still very young.  In recent months, he has been struggling to provide for his children's basic needs (e.g., education), which has been his greatest challenge.  But he explains that he is constantly working to provide for his children and to pay his bills.  \r\n\r\nK. supports his family by working as a trader.  Specifically, for 11 years now, he has been in the business of selling used clothing and bed sheets.  Selling such items is big business in Ghana because brand-new cloths are too expensive for much of the population.  He travels to a nearby city known as Kumasi to purchase his stock of goods.

buying and selling clothing for many years. The need to improve his income and provide education to his two dear children is the reason he is courteously requesting this loan. Kodirjon has so far accessed loans from Kiva partner, IMON International, twice and has seen his business expand. With the income, he said he was able to educate his children, which is most important to Kodirjon. Today, he is requesting a loan of 5000 TJS to expand his business so that he can generate more income for the wellbeing of his family. Kodirjon is very grateful to everyone who helps him achieve his dreams with this loan. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for general store and maintenance for crab traps so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Selonah E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He says that he feels happy to have formed a united family.  Mateo is married to 48 year-old Elva, with whom he has three children.  Only 21 year-old Mayner still lives with them in their home, which they own.  They live in the small village of Huaylahuichan.\r\n\r\nIn common with every man, Mateo has had to face difficulties in life.  He remembers that, in order to pay for his children's education, he used to take the small amount of produce that he grew and sell it straight away.  He almost didn't earn enough until, 30 years ago, he and his wife bought large stretches of land.  This is where he currently grows corn, peas, alfalfa and potatoes.  This purchase allowed him to make more income which he used to buy more land.  He built his own home and now lives comfortably.\r\n\r\nMateo admires his wife Elva because she is the great manager behind all of their achievements.  \"She is an entrepreneurial and determined woman who knew how to make good use of the money that came into our hands\", he says.  For this reason, he is not afraid to admit that his wife is the one who manages all the money that he earns.  Mateo is looking for relaxation in his life.  He is always saving up so that he can build lodgings in the future where he can serve his customers and make income without so much effort.  He is preparing for his future when he will not have the same strength to work the land.\r\n\r\nMateo is a member of the \"Nueva Esperanza\" (New Hope) community bank and this is his seventh loan from MFP.  He is certain that he will access future loans because he says that his savings, his punctual loan repayments, and the active work that he carries out as a member of his community bank guarantee him as a responsible person.\r\n\r\nMateo will invest the loan he has requested in paying for seven hectares of farmland as he will rent out the land that he already owns at a higher price and thereby make a bit of extra money.  He plans to use this to buy corn seed and organic fertilizer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":764269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to rent seven hectares of land to farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-06T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mateo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3033.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666076}],"funded_date":"2011-05-17T06:01:01Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":300203,"name":"Patrocinia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Patrocinia, se dedica a la venta de pupusas y ropa, vive con su esposo y tienen 3 hijos.

She lives with her partner, Diego, and their three children, 5, 3, and 1 years old, in her in-law\u2019s house. Katia sells grocery staples in a small store set up in the house where she lives. She opened the store two years ago with her own capital, which she has reinvested and increased. Based on how well received she has been, she can now send products to the settlements located on the banks of the Ucayali river and relies on her father-in-law\u2019s help for this, since he is entrusted with those deliveries.\r\n\r\nWhat Katia likes about her work is the ability to earn an income that allows her to help her partner with the expense of feeding and raising their children,  since his income as a motorcycle taxi driver is often not sufficient and they have to rely on her in-laws\u2019 help for some of their necessities.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP and she is requesting a small amount so that she will be able to meet her commitments.
