They have five children who are between 31 and 44 years old. \r\n\r\nEleonor joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eleonor has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save for the future needs of her family. Eleonor is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Isfara, Tajikistan. An experienced entrepreneur, he has been selling for 10 years and has been successful offering good quality products for low prices. Abdurahim supports his family of five with his venture. He has requested a loan of 13,000 somoni so that he can purchase new inventory to stock his kiosks. This is Abdurahim's first loan with IMON International. The loan will greatly improve Abdurahim\u2019s income and his family's living standards.     \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Due to economic hardship and scarce job opportunities, Juana decided to launch this business with the help of her children who worked in Costa Rica.

He lives with one of his daughters and her family. He works the land with the help of his sons who share in profits from the production. He has been living on the land for more than 60 years. He hopes that he will be able to buy fertilizer and seeds with the loan. He also wants to rent a tractor to work the land so it will be more productive. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":25877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-14T01:48:52Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aroldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-28T09:26:28Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21433},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:42:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31820},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:16:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51886},{"amount":323,"local_amount":323,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:21:09Z","rounded_local_amount":323,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107784}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T09:26:28Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12182,"name":"Khanlar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"R.

Thi Hoan, 39 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2007. Her family relies mainly on agriculture and their income falls into the average range. Mrs. Hoan has 4 schooling children. Her first loan of  5,000,000VND (312.50USD) was used to invest in rearing pigs. She always took the time and money to purchase more bran and corn to feed the pigs, so after the first loan she sold the pigs and gained a profit of 8,000,000VND (about 500USD). She continued to use this profit to purchase pigs and pig feeds. Her husband is a construction worker with the monthly income of 2,000,000VND (about 125USD). This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to continue investing in rearing pigs. Her average monthly income is 5,000,000VND (about 312.50USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Thi Ho\u00e0n 39 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2007, ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb b\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u1eddng v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p l\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu.

With the funds requested, R\u00f3mulo will have his three-wheeled motorcar repaired.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisette Artiga, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":261894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair his three-wheeled motorcar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-27T04:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"R\u00f3mulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150.58},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":158.9},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":162.02},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":169.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":176.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":182.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":51.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.07},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":150.58,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":155.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423706},{"amount":51.64,"local_amount":158.9,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":164.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116975},{"amount":52.65,"local_amount":162.02,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":167.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011896},{"amount":55.07,"local_amount":169.45,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":175.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595496},{"amount":57.27,"local_amount":176.22,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":182.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989735},{"amount":59.43,"local_amount":182.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:08Z","rounded_local_amount":189.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210874}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T05:42:27Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisette Artiga","image":351081}},{"id":90030,"name":"Ghullam Sediq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ghullam Sediq K. is 46 years old, married and the father of five children.

In 2007, he started a small retail business. With his sister, he went to Ereen, China (a border city) to buy cheap clothes and sold them at profit in his small rented space in the local market.  Since May 2008, he left the retail business to his sister and started a small photo-taking business in a small rented room. He takes photos for passport, IDs, and customized photos for school and college commencements. As the business slows down due to popularity of digital cameras for most families, he expanded his service by adding a computer, where he creates various cards such as invitation cards. He also types various documents in his computer for his customers. In addition, he added a small cellphone-service business, where he uploads songs and videos for cellphones. His business does well during anniversaries and wedding celebrations. He requested a loan to buy a decent-quality camera and printer.

She has five children; three of them are still dependent upon her.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling groceries for years.  She started her business by saving little by little and selling products her farm produces.  With the loan from Manuela Ramos, she had more capital; she started with 300 PEN.  She bought products and set up her little store.  Now her friends and neighbors know and welcome her, and the products sell themselves.  One of the big advantages she has is that she is located near a small field, and that is where she sells her cold soft drinks.\r\n\r\nWith a loan for 800 PEN she will buy groceries like rice, sacks of sugar, packages of milk and oil.  She will also buy packages of different flavors and sizes of soft drinks, housecleaning supplies, and personal hygiene items.  This way she can keep her customers satisfied and happy.\r\n\r\nShe feels very satisfied with the work she does.  She believes it is worth the sacrifice to accomplish the dreams and goals that she has outlined for her life.

All of her children were able to attend school (unlike her) and she made sure to send them to private school so that they could have a quality education.   \r\n\r\n Sarah\u2019s business is selling plastic dishes in the market.  She has been doing this for 4 years.  She says that she attracts customers by talking sweet to them and making them laugh.  She dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can support the rest of her children through school.    \r\n\r\nWith the loan she is requesting, she will be able to restock her dishes.  Because the currency is ever changing, Sarah does not have a specfic number of containers of dishes that she plans to buy.  She hopes that the money will stretch to allow her to purchase 13-20 dozen.

Her business is also located there. \r\n\r\nSalama owns a small shop where she sells spare parts. She has been an entrepreneur since 2005. Salama has decided to be a businesswoman because, before, when she was a farmer, she could not meet the needs of her family. So far so good, because she is able to sort out her family problems.

They have come to SMT, a Kiva partner, to seek a loan of SLL 500,000 each to enable them to expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nWith a loan of SLL 500,000, they will each be able to add more stock to their business, make more sales, and more profit. Consequently, they will be able to improve their standard of living by feeding and clothing their children and sending them to school. \r\n\r\nYeakain S. is the leader of this group.

and French beans. He has been in the farming business for 20 years, selling all his produce at the local market. Farming has been his main source of income. His major challenge has been lack of a ready market for farm produce, which affects his cash flows. \n\nCharles has requested a loan of 70,000 Kenyan shillings in order to cultivate his banana farm. He specifically wants to expand the acreage under bananas by acquiring more land. He says that this will improve his banana production and enable him to enjoy the economies of scale.

The money that Lucelia gets from this loan will go towards purchasing bread, meat, oil, and fresh fruit to make smoothies at her local venue.

Many of the women in this 15-person bank have recently immigrated from Haiti in search of a better future.  Their businesses are simple, but offer a stream of income that could never have been accomplished without such a loan for initial capital.  Several of the women sell clothes and shoes in the street, while others go from office to office vending fresh fruit and vegetables daily.  These unique entrepreneurs have united in solidarity, allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  <P>The concept of this group bank repaying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the other members gladly help cover one another\u2019s payments in order to receive their next loan together.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

To make a living, she owns and operates a hog-fattening business venture in the agriculture sector. The main source of income for the business comes from selling her pigs.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. Lolita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional piglets.

She is 24 years old, single, and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, she runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $115 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Liezel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This will be her 4th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":558457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Sangmahmad has always been a hard-working man, who has made sure, from a young age that his family never goes without daily bread. He is married with two children. Sangmahmad has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuff. With a starting capital of $400 USD, and perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise 5 years ago. He has expanded his business and today his family helps him with the business. Today he needs to buy additional foodstuff to increase the variety of his products. For this purpose, Sangmahmad is requesting a loan of $1500 USD. He is ready to work even harder and make sacrifices to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.   \r\n      \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Nidia R. R. is a very wise woman who knows exactly what strategies to implement in every moment of her life; especially in regards to her business.  She started out selling gold jewelry, but when the price of gold rose, sales began to decline and profits fell, so she changed her merchandise.  The same customers that she had sold jewelry to, she started selling them vegetables such as lentils, beans, rice, and oil.  She gradually attracted more customers and more orders, creating a need for increased investment.  \r\n\r\nThus, seven years ago, Nidia went to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organization that has supported her with four loans.  She succeeded in diversifying her products and improving timeliness to market.  For example, she sells pork on weekends, dairy products every day, and food supplies twice a week.\r\n\r\nWith all the support of FMSD, Nidia's discipline and interest in growing her business has improved all aspects of her life.  At 68 years old, she dreams of increasing sales volume and profits every day.  Competition is her main obstacle and she is always forced to use marketing strategies to hold on to her customers.  This is Nidia's fifth loan with FMSD.  She will buy rice, flour, powdered milk, pasta, toiletries, and vegetables to supply her business and increase her working capital.  With this loan, her dream of continued success will be realized.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Angela Yeh, Kiva

Lolita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lolita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

He is divorced from his wife and so lives alone in his own house which is located in urbanization of Valle Dorado, Pichari. Fredy always wanted to have a plot of land on which he could farm since from a very early age he has loved nature. He is very concerned about what is happening to the environment. In the past, he would know whether it would rain or not, however, with global warming things have changed and all this means that his produce does not produce the amount it should, generating economic losses which are not at all favourable for him. Therefore his plants require more fertilizers and protection from insect pests or fungi that might harm them. It is important for Fredy to take care of his crop as it is his only source of income. In the future, he wants to plant more cocoa and produce in large quantities, thereby making a better income. This will be his second loan with MFP and he agrees to make his repayments on time.

Rosenie and the other members are responsible for making payments on this loan together and must help anyone in their solidarity group who may have trouble paying on time, which fosters accountability and social support.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cooking ingredients, vegetables, a pot, a skillet and coals, matches, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HT","country":"Haiti","town":"Trou-du-Nord","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.633333 -72.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T16:01:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosenie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T11:18:56Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-11T22:21:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":22328},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-07-03T20:52:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":28708},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-08-13T20:02:01Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":42319},{"amount":400,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2007-09-25T09:19:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58499},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T09:21:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71766}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T11:18:56Z","paid_date":"2007-10-25T09:21:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12214,"name":"Lidia Rufina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Lidia M. and I have dedicated myself to selling new clothes for women, men and children such as t-shirts, button down shirts, blouses, pants, jeans, shorts, caps, socks and shoes.

Since the last loan there has been a big change in her personal circumstances - Raihona and her husband divorced. Now she is living alone with her children. Despite the tough economic situation, Raihona continues as an entreprenuer, as business is the sole source of income for her family. Six months ago she traveled between the outlying markets. Now she rents a small stall at the city's central market and sells there. She has already earned many new and regular customers at the new location. The sales season for spring clothes is beginning now, and Raihona decided to request another loan through Microinvest. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":285756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of clothes for the spring season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raihona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":941.96},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":979.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1018.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1059.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.15},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":253.15,"local_amount":941.96,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":947.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015983},{"amount":263.28,"local_amount":979.64,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":985.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599711},{"amount":273.81,"local_amount":1018.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994153},{"amount":284.76,"local_amount":1059.58,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215434}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T09:43:33Z","paid_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":98254,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth has been a milk seller in the Tengeru neighborhood of Arusha for 10 years.

C. is from the village of Holy Friday. She is 55 years old. Cristeta is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Cristeta D. C.'s Group.\r\n<p>\r\nCristeta is married and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Cristeta owns & operates an agricultural business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Cristeta has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Cristeta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. Cristeta is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Cristeta from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":507119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

With the previous loan, Consolacion noticed that her monthly income almost doubled because she attracted more customers with her additional stock.\r\n<br>Prior to working with ASHI, Consolacion had no access to capital to support her business dreams. Positive growth from her business has helped Consolacion finance her children's education. Since joining ASHI, Consolacion has experienced positive changes in her life and used the additional income to support her family's daily expenditure. She hopes her business will continue to flourish so she can provide long-term financial stability for her family. \r\n<br>Consolacion is now requesting a Kiva loan for 20,000 PHP to purchase more foodstuffs for her store. This will allow her to grow her business further so that her family experiences a life that is full of fulfillment. With the support of ASHI and Kiva lenders, Consolacion is hopeful that her business endeavor will provide a steady income and improve her family\u2019s quality of life, which is currently underneath an umbrella of poverty.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Masele has many years of experience in this business.  Masele needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Masele joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Masele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Masele T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.55 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.89 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Bros Loem, is a construction worker.

She stays at home and fulfills her household responsibilities efficiently. She has very good administrative abilities and handles the expenses of her home with great responsibility.  She also does embroidery part time for her neighborhood clients to help her husband financially.  She lives with her family in a three room brick house in Lahore, Pakistan. Lahore is the 2nd largest city of Pakistan and known for its history and culture. She has been living there in the area of Daata town for past 18 years. She is the mother of 2 sons and 4 daughters. Her sons work in a factory for a meager income and her daughters stay at home and help their mother in her household work. \r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s name is M. S., and he manufactures furniture to order. His furniture showroom is located in the market, and he has a good number of clients who give him good orders of furniture.  Zahida has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, to further expand her husband\u2019s business.

She lives in her own home with her partner Filomeno, 36, and their two beloved children: Nancy, 11, and Maykol, 8.  They want to provide the children with a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nWith much effort, Leonora bought land to cultivate coffee, cacao and make toothpicks.  She works her land with her partner\u2019s help, and with the field workers who provide support.  They also help weed the land and gather harvests to the roads, so that they can then take them to market.  \r\n\r\nLeonora has done this for fifteen years.  What she likes most about her work is the liberty that she has over the use of her labor, since she decides what is best for her crops.  What she considers most difficult is fighting the plague of insects that take over crop shoots.  But today, Leonora\u2019s main priority is to buy new land so that she can expand.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth loan with MFP.  She knows that she needs to be punctual in her payments and wants to access a subsequent loan.  She is very happy to be a part of her communal bank and contributes to the development of the group.  With the loan, she will purchase cacao and coffee seeds.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":763535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cacao and coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-04T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245169}],"funded_date":"2011-05-08T17:56:22Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Flavia Garcia (vol)","image":1574380}},{"id":299895,"name":"Gerry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerry is 41 years of age with five children.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because she has a very large family, she needs additional income.  This is why, she started to buy and sell fabrics and food products.  She tries hard to improve her family life and ensure that her children attend prestigious schools and universities.  She is requesting a loan in the sum of $2000 for the purchase of school uniforms and supplies because school year is about to start, and everyone is getting ready for school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":852226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase school uniforms and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":143.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":161},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":161.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":170.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":176.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":180.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":184.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":188.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143.79,"local_amount":143.79,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-19T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":143.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233368478},{"amount":153.37,"local_amount":153.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":153.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238643611},{"amount":151.3,"local_amount":151.3,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":151.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244598050},{"amount":156.34,"local_amount":156.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":156.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250812045},{"amount":161.02,"local_amount":161.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":161.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257220734},{"amount":161.99,"local_amount":161.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":161.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263580681},{"amount":1072.19,"local_amount":1072.19,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-17T08:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1072.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270458069}],"funded_date":"2011-09-26T22:53:33Z","paid_date":"2012-04-17T08:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":332683,"name":"Rogen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rogen is 37 years old and married.

Thi Bich is 33 years old. She lives with her husband and 2 children in the town of Ninh Giang, province of Hai Duong. Presently their main source of income is from raising pigs and selling their meat. Every day her husband, Mr. Lan, would go purchase the pigs, and she would sell the meat at the local market. The work is hard but it brings them a stable income. With their income of 183 USD per month, it helps her family in repaying the loans. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 550 USD to buy additional 7 pigs to raise, and subsequently to sell their meat for the upcoming Tet Holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

With God's help he has become an excellent supplier of vegetables for his community.  He is responsible for four people (a wife and three children) and earns his family's living with his farming.  He knows all the ins and outs of this business, in which he has 5 years of experience.  His great trump is his production of vegetables in the off-season; however, in order to accomplish this, he needs investment for purchasing seeds and mineral fertilizer.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan of 1500 Somoni ($450 USD) so as to supply enough to meet the demand.  This will allow him to better provide for his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 41 years old. Rachel is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Rachel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Rachel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rachel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rachel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rachel is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the twelfth loan taken out by Rachel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Jes\u00fas says that he decided to go into this line of work because there was no competition in the area and it is a very profitable business; a fact that was confirmed when he made his first profits.  That's how he started and today he continues to prepare his delicious dishes and pleasantly taking care of his customers, who seek out Jes\u00fas's fried chicken because of the quality and quantity he offers.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":576529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sapang Dalaga Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166855190},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121906},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177416004},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555544},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188692257},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191431551}],"funded_date":"2010-08-13T22:55:51Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":226143,"name":"Jeanette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanette G., 46, wants to achieve more in life not just for herself but for her family as well.
