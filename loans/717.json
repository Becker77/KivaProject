She is a married woman who has seven children. Five of them are currently pursuing education in the junior and senior high schools. Theresa\u2019s husband is a food crop farmer. Theresa and her family live at a family house in Oda in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Most of the inhabitants of Oda are either into farming or trade in farm products. Very few people run different types of business. \n\nTheresa trades in clothing materials and jewelry. She buys textile fabrics, bedspreads, and all kinds of brand new clothes, including ladies\u2019 wear and men\u2019s wear, from Accra, a nearby city, and sells them in her shop in the market square in her community.

She sells to all types of people, both retail and wholesale. Teddy buys secondhand clothes from Owino Market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda.  She goes shopping once a week.\r\n\r\nTeddy wants to use this loan to buy more bales of secondhand clothes.  She has been in this business for fifteen years. Besides this clothing business, she also gets additional income from rental rooms.  Teddy works seven days a week, and her business challenges include transportation and seasonality. She aspires to go directly into importing these clothes.\r\n\r\nTeddy decided to work with MCDT because they work with women who are in groups. Teddy resides in and owns a two-room house, and the family has access to electricity but no piped water. Her monthly expenses include paying utility bills and school fees.

This area is characterized by crop and livestock farming. \r\n\r\nPedro has for a number of years devoted himself to caring for and selling goats. His pens are located to the rear of his house and are appropriate and spacious. He feeds them with a commercially prepared feed and natural grasses, so that his animals may reach optimal growth in order to offer them at the various markets in the area and thus obtain much better earnings to cover daily living costs in his home. \r\n\r\nHe has sought a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2,500 Peruvian soles to purchase commercial feed for his animals and make repairs to the kitchen in his home. With the income he will receive from the sale of his goals he can cover the loan and improve the quality of life of his family. Pedro is a hardworking and very responsible person.

This money will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business to buy groceries to replenish her current product inventory. She will also invest some of the loan amount in the purchase of cellular phone load for different networks. She dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Z., 52, is a hardworking man whose business is making breakfasts, lunches, pupusas (typical Central American food-cornmeal filled with cheese, or pork or beans) tortillas, and he also sells juices, fruit shakes and sodas.  Carlos lives in  Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n with his wife, their three children: 12, 13 and 7 - all students.  The business is located in Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n near the  Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as University.  The location is a great benefit because the majority of students like this type of business since food is offered at a lower price.  Also Carlos has many customers who are workers in different offices that are found nearby.  Despite  the fact that there is a lot of competition, he tries to make the best possible food so that he can always count on regular customers and that they will recommend him to others.  Carlos is a very responsible and friendly man who is dedicated to his work.  He is asking for the loan to have money to be able to buy a greater quantity of the necessary ingredients so that he can make more food, broaden his menu, and thus keep his customers satisfied and continue eating what he sells.  This is very important to him and to his family since the business is their only source of income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She purchases chickens from wholesalers and then processes the meat into appropriate sizes and cuts to sell to her customers at retail prices.  In the photo, the chickens that are smaller and slightly darker come from the small farms of local individuals, while the ones that are larger and slightly lighter in color come from large scale factory farms.  The small farm-raised chickens sell for a higher price due to their stronger flavor and more natural meat.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nHermelinda has already worked with our institution a number of times in the past, always making punctual payments and completing the requirements of the loan.  Her previous loans have been for values between $200.00 and $250.00.  This will be the largest loan she has yet undertaken, and she will use it to purchase a larger quantity of chicken from the wholesalers in order to receive a greater bulk discount.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

He is married and has three children one of whom is currently in school. For the past four years, Robert has been working hard to manage his grocery store, which sells groundnuts, millet and sorghum. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Robert has requested a loan of 1,500,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more millet to sell, and will help Robert to generate greater profits and eventually purchase more groundnuts. Robert hopes that in the future he will be able to build a permanent house for his family. \r\n\r\nRobert is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Robert who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":935245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Shirly has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shirly joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Shirly is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Shirly from HSPFI.

He cares for his 10 year old son, Joseph, and is a hard worker.  He fills the role of mother and father and he and his son live together in their own home in the \u201c6 de Agosto\u201d section of Anco.  Armanto began his adventure as a farmer on his parents\u2019 land when he was a boy.  His passion for agriculture took him to acquiring his own land, where he has been working independently for the six years.  He raises cacao, and coffee on 5 hectares.  During the harvest season he hires farm hands who pick the crops with great speed and he is able to get his work done efficiently.  He is very committed to his work because he sees that his efforts pay off when his plants produce a good crop, which generates income for every kilogram he sells.  He says that he does not really like the winters because there are many insects during that time and the rains impede his work and damage his plants.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for this loan of 2,000 PEN so he can buy cacao plants to plant and harvest their bounty in a short time.  He also wants to buy some more land so that he can increase his production.  This will be his first loan through MFP and he is prepared to make all of his payment on time.  He wants to apply for more loans in the future.  He is grateful to the institution for helping him get this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":746105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy more cacao plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-10T18:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":164.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":231.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.43},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.98,"local_amount":347.54,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":353.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270181},{"amount":65,"local_amount":179.31,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:12Z","rounded_local_amount":182.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718877},{"amount":146.28,"local_amount":403.52,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":410.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350345},{"amount":66.99,"local_amount":184.79,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":188.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621155},{"amount":76.14,"local_amount":210.05,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:39Z","rounded_local_amount":213.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835322},{"amount":79.19,"local_amount":218.45,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":222.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245117},{"amount":165.42,"local_amount":456.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":464.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385264}],"funded_date":"2011-04-20T16:03:57Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":236735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 50 bags of rice in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T13:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica J.

They are taught they have to save and they always give them recommendations. \r\nRuby tells us that before she had to borrow money from other people who were asking her for high interests; now that Finca (Kiva's field partner) is here she is doing better.\r\nHer dream is to prosper and have a small restaurant and to help her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":252192,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Food supplies for her meals business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-10T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rubi Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215433},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":104.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397142},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":104.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088816},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:00:23Z","rounded_local_amount":104.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982172},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":208.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442777}],"funded_date":"2009-01-10T22:29:39Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:55:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ana Gabriela Clark","image":22141}},{"id":86826,"name":"Jiguiya  (L\u2019Esp\u00e9rance).

They are on average 37 years old with 5 kids. Their principal business is selling bread, meat, locally-produced juice, and firewood. They have experience selling firewood and food. With the idea of increasing the size of their business, the members decided to use Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program, which they have been doing for six years. After having repaid each of their ten first loans, the Jiguiya group is on its eleventh group loan.\r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy firewood in the surrounding villages of Belesso, Sirak\u00e9l\u00e9, and Tiesso and will be resold at home. The bread and grilled meat, which can\u2019t be stocked, are bought and sold daily during recess in front of schools. They generally sell for cash or credit to a clientele consisting of all social groups.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, they intend to earn on average 75,000 CFA francs each in profit during the loan term. This profit will be used to repay the loan and meet the needs of their families.

Mabinuligon, Brgy. Maquiling, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and standing cane businesses.  Her husband Crispin, who is 74 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and he also helps his wife.  They have seven children who are 28 to 50 years old. \r\n\r\nAmparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amparo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy standing cane and stocks for her general store so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and to expand her standing cane business.  Amparo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures - a pig fattening business and a fish vending business. Her husband Allan, who is 37 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 5 to 12 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nNimpha  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nimpha has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to as additional working capital  for her business ventures so that she could continue to save up for future education of her children and support the family's household expenses. Nimpha is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She also claims that she has not experienced any losses because whenever the price of peas is low at the market, she will dry her harvest and sells her products as seeds.  As a result, she earns slightly more that what she invested.  Each bag of seed sells for at least 500 PEN.  Her main difficulty has been not having her own land so that she can cover the educational expenses of her children.

Many FPW borrowers have recently expressed a desire to borrow larger amounts to make more significant investments in their businesses.

community (called a batey) of Peligro, which lies in the countryside outside of El Seybo, Dominican Republic. She is the group coordinator for the Bank of Hope called Mujeres Unidas de Peligro (United Women of Peligro), Group 2. Altagracia's story is illustrative of the experiences of her fellow borrowers in Mujeres Unidas de Peligro. \r\n\r\nToday, Altagracia is taking out her seventh loan with Kiva and Esperanza International in order to buy more food products, such as beef, pork, juice, and other provisions, to sell in the small grocery store she runs out of her home. Altagracia has been managing her store for 8 years, and she reports that business has grown significantly since she became a client of Kiva and Esperanza three and a half years ago. With small loans from Kiva and Esperanza, Altagracia has been able to purchase new appliances, such as a food processor and a juicer, to expand her store's offerings and increase sales. Today, Altagracia can afford to borrow almost three times the amount of her very first Kiva loan. She also says that, although she had some savings before, with Kiva loans she can now mobilize her savings more effectively to support the needs of herself and her family. \r\n\r\nAltagracia lives with her four children (ages 9, 8, 6, and 4) and her husband. Altagracia's income, along with what her spouse earns working as a mechanic for the large Central Romana corporation, helps support herself and her family members.

Rosa sells bedspreads by catalogue.  With her earnings she pays for transportation costs for her four children.  Her husband takes care of household expenses and other things.  Rosa's problem is that sometimes she has to wait for payment on orders she has already delivered and sometimes she doesn't get paid at all.

His faithful ally in his business is his accordion, with which he plays countless melodies. He works around six hours daily, depending on the number of people who come to the cemetery. \r\n\r\nThe reason he does it, he tells us, is that it is very moving to see people burying their family members, or remembering the year of their passing. But he feels that with his music he can aleviate in part, the pain and sadness that they feel. Sometimes he has cried while he was playing his music, but life goes on, and one has to move forward. \r\n\r\nHe thinks that because of the sensitivity he has, it is going well for him in his business; he understands the pain and suffering that his customers are going through, and that is why he has work. \r\n\r\nEusebio is very happy, and very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to their help he will be able to undetake the paperwork necessary to obtain his certification as a music teacher.

The market where Mariya works is the only one in the neighborhood and there are few other entrepreneurs offering the same type of goods. This is another reason for Mariya's high sales and the success of her trade. Mariya is requesting a loan of 2500 Grivnas to increase her inventory. She is planning to re-stock her kiosk with clothing items to boost her sales. Being a good steward of the money she receives, Mariya will manage this loan efficiently and repay it on time. Hopefully, one day she'll be able to fulfill her dream and open her own little store of clothing items. \r\n\r\nNote: this is a short term \"seasonal\" loan that will be repaid in two months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":194868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Uzhgorod","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.616667 22.3","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-08-26T22:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-10T01:56:22Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339082},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323197}],"funded_date":"2008-08-27T01:56:22Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T06:07:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":66367,"name":"Rahma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rahma is 36 years old.

She strives hard so that she is able to provide a good future for her two young children who are only 1 and 5 years old. Josie is 31 years old and lives in the village of Barangay Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, with her young family. Many of her friends look to her as a role model because of her determination to pursue her dreams and do her utmost to put up a small business and build it up so that she is able to help her husband in supporting and sustaining the needs of their family.\r\n\r\nBanking on her cooking skills, Josie decided to put a carinderia - a local eatery selling and serving a variety of cooked dishes. A carinderia is also sometimes called a \"turo-turo\" because the customers literally point to their choice from the array of pots containing the ready-to-eat viands. \r\n\r\nJosie joined NWTF-Project Dunganon in 2002 to access additional capital she needed to open the eatery she planned to set up adjacent to her house. From the start, she tapped the loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to continually improve her business facilities and widen her food offerings. And because she proved to be an astute businesswoman, her business generates a good income that significantly helps provide for the support of her family, with enough left over for the savings she set up for her two children.\r\n\r\nThe carinderia provides Josie with an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 which is enabling her to gradually fulfill her dreams, including saving enough to renovate and enlarge the space in her carinderia. This, so that she could have more space for the growing number of customers.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Josie borrowed PHP 17,000 to add to her capital and it was fully repaid without any delays. She is now borrowing PHP 17,500 for her 11th loan. She plans to use it again as revolving working capital so that she can purchase more meat and spices and expand the number and volume of her daily food offerings. She plans to save some of the profits so that she can invest in another productive asset that can contribute to the family income. The rest she plans to plow back into her carinderia business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":394502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
