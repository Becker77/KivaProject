She is single, is 48 years old and is mother to four children, one of whom is in her care and studies. Before needing to provide the family income and motivated by her own desire, she started her small business selling food. With her first loan of S. 300, she obtained very good results due to the rich flavors that she injected into her dishes, her low prices and the attention she paid to her customers. Later, she added grocery sales to her business, which is located in her home. Currently, she is continuing with both businesses, where her main customers are her neighbors. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of S. 1,500, she will purchase more products with which to stock her business such as kilos of rice and sugar, eggs, cleaning products for the bathroom and house, sodas in packets, candy and other products that make her customers happy. Part of the money will also be invested in the purchase of ingredients to prepare her dishes. Today, she feels happy about her work and the service she provides and she is thankful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for the support it gives to people like her who want to work and get ahead. She hopes it continues for a long time and helps many families and entrepreneurial women.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":375326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"She will purchase more groceries to increase her product stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-08-23T16:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":258.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635734},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":258.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074891},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":258.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990255},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":258.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835181},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":258.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726971},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":258.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117498}],"funded_date":"2009-08-23T17:51:52Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":135661,"name":"Sophoin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sophoin T., age 39, is widow with three children: two daughters and one son.

It is a small rural community that is located 40 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. This area is characterized by agriculture and livestock breeding.\r\n\r\nPaulina has been raising dairy cattle for 20 years.  This work allows her to earn income from the sale of milk, which she sells in her community or in areas close to her community. She also works in handicrafts (making sombreros from straw and palm), from which she also earns a small income.  These activities allow her to manage some of the daily household expenses, as what her husband earns as an agricultural laborer is not enough to cover the family expenses.\r\n\r\nPastures for feeding the cattle have been scarce, which is why she has seen it necessary to apply for a loan through Edpyme Alternativea for 1,000  New Soles.  The money will be invested in the purchase of alfalfa and balanced feed for her livestock, therefore resulting in increased milk production.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to give her daughters a quality education.

Norma would like to improve her store with new, eye-catching outfits.\r\n\r\nThis is Norma's sixth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your support so that she can carry out her plans.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.  Norma enjoys being a member of her community bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.  With your support, Norma will invest the money she has requested in buying materials such as fabric, threads, lace, edging materials and other decorative items for making her outfits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":918006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Christina believes in independence and wanted to set up a business to provide a good future for her husband and her self. With no children she wanted to start saving and building a good stable home before children arrive into the picture. So she joined the programme in 2003. Her first loan was used to start a small grocery store, which was operated from at home. The only grocery shop in her neighborhood Christina was able to use the following loans to build a permanent place for the shop in front of their home. Being the sole breadwinner of the family, she carefully budgets her earnings to sustain her family needs and set aside some cash for savings and loan payment. It is quite difficult for her to support an extended family but expanding her grocery will help ease her burden. Christina hopes to use her loan to improve her small grocery store and purchase more stocks.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

As in all business there exists the competitiveness of supply and demand, but all of them wish to excel in their business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her story is representative of the other members of her group as well as of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whome recently moved from Haiti to the DR) clients more generally. Rosa's group is based in the industrial town of Los Alcarrizzos, a dusty city north of the capital where both running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable at best. Here she makes her home in a simple structure of cement walls and a tin roof with her husband and five school aged children. Her business is also located in her home.\n\nRosa has shown herself to be a reliable Esperanza client by completing one loan cycle with out problems. She is excited to take her next loan and with it she plans to invest in her business by purchasing a hair dryer, curling iron and hair products to sell in her store. She believes this will improve her profits and with those profits she plans to purchase school supplies for her children and hopefully a computer so that they will be able to learn about technology. In the future she hopes that God will help lead her children down the correct path and that He will bless her with the ability to provide for her children what they need. She tanks you all for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":405120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She has already been in this business for quite some time, and so has a group of loyal customers who she knows and who always return to her business to acquire their products.  She always tries her best to make progress with her business; she tries to buy the best quality products and offer them to her customers with friendly service.  Her husband is a farmer and together they always work arduously to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nDionila wants to expand her business by acquiring more merchandise and increasing her sales, so that she can have greater earnings.  To achieve this objective she has decided to apply, for the first time, for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 Peruvian soles.\r\n\r\nDionila is a hardworking woman who is dedicated to her family and her customers, and her colleagues consider her to be a friendly and respectful woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":575294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy garments to expand her business selling in the market ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. She has two children, who are 21 and 22 years old. \r\n\r\nGenerosa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Generosa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 45,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can buy more stock to sell in her sari-sari store in order to continue to save enough capital so that she can start a piggery business. Generosa T. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Her husband helps her with the sewing, so the couple tries to fill all of the orders together. He is in charge of distribution.

So her main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling bamboo products in the local community.  Oanh has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 4200000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1999, Oanh joined TYM Fund, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Oanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000000 VND from TYM Fund. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Oanh is now requesting a new loan of 20000000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business. The loan will be the seventh loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.  Oanh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout TYM Fund:\r\n<p>\r\nThe mission of TYM Fund is to improve

Mar\u00eda tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene cinco hijos de 9, 7, 5, 3 a\u00f1os y la \u00faltima de un mes de edad, los tres primeros hijos los cuales son varones est\u00e1n estudiando en la escuela de Ceraturo. Antes de ser socia de la Fundaci\u00f3n trabajaba conjuntamente con su esposo en una hacienda la  Victoria del Portete  como peones, sacando leche de las vacas, en labores del campo, su horario era de 6 AM. A 6 PM. En esta hacienda los jefes eran algunos buenos y otros malos, pero lo que no le gustaba a Mar\u00eda era que no los consideraban ya que deb\u00edan ser cumplidos con su trabajo que no hab\u00eda ning\u00fan justificativo para faltar, no les importaba hijos ni enfermedades. Es socia m\u00e1s o menos desde el 16 de Junio de este a\u00f1o, un vecino del barrio les hizo conocer de la fundaci\u00f3n y les invit\u00f3 a que ingresen, pidi\u00f3 $110 de pr\u00e9stamo para comprar cuyes y hierba, para de esta manera salir de la hacienda en donde ella trabaja porque el tiempo no le alcanza para cuidar a sus hijos. Su meta es poder trabajar en la crianza de animales no solo de cuyes sino tambi\u00e9n de vacas, puercos y pollos para as\u00ed progresar y poderles dar lo que ellos necesiten.\n\nLa socia Rosal\u00eda C. tiene 36 a\u00f1os, es casada, y tiene una hija de 16 a\u00f1os. Su esposo trabaja en latoner\u00eda, reparando y pintando los carros, mientras ella trabaja como empleada dom\u00e9stica y adem\u00e1s vende productos cosm\u00e9ticas de Avon y de otras marcas tambi\u00e9n. Sus clientes son principalmente sus vecinas, amigas y conocidas. Hace 8 a\u00f1os que vende cosm\u00e9ticos, y desde ni\u00f1a est\u00e1 trabajando en los trabajos que le surgen, como empleada o en restaurantes. Ella tambi\u00e9n se encarga de los quehaceres dom\u00e9sticos de su propia casa. Suele trabajar desde las 7:30am hasta las 5pm. Est\u00e1 pidiendo este cr\u00e9dito de $220 para comprar productos de Avon, porque vende a cr\u00e9dito. Aveces la empresa hace promociones, entonces para ella le conviene cubrir los costos en estos momentos y recuperarlos despu\u00e9s. Ella toma pedidos de sus clientes para cada quincena, y suele recibir $100-$120 en pedidos cada quincena, de los cuales un 25% es ganancia para ella (la ganancia se desminuye entre 5% y 10% despu\u00e9s de tomar en cuenta sus costos). Este es la primera vez que ella ha sacado un pr\u00e9stamo. Para el futuro, le gustar\u00eda poner un negocio propio, por ejemplo un restaurante, porque le gusta mucho cocinar. \n\nTodos los socios y las socias est\u00e1n comprometidos a pagar el cr\u00e9dito puntualmente y de una manera responsable. \n","en":"The Ceraturo Communal Bank is a group of 17 women and men who are residents of the Ceraturo Irquis neighborhood of Victoria del Portete, located to the south of the city of Cuenca.  This region experiences extreme cold while fog develops in the afternoons, making it difficult for people to travel through the streets and preventing them from leaving their homes.\r\n<p>\r\nMember Mar\u00eda Tr\u00e1nsito P., for the past 3 months, has been living in the house of her sister-in-law who currently resides abroad.   Mar\u00eda is 23 years old, married, and has 5 children (ages 9, 7, 5, 3 and 1 month).  Three of the children attend school in Ceraturo.  Before joining Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she and her husband worked on the Victoria del Portete Estate as farm laborers.  They milked the cows and worked in the fields.  Their work schedule was from 6am to 6pm.  At the estate, some of the supervisors were good and while others were bad.  However, none of them liked it whenever Mar\u00eda had to miss work or leave early to take care of her children whenever they became sick.  She became a member around June 16th of this year when a neighbor told her about the Foundation and invited her to join.  She is requesting a loan of $110 so that she can buy guinea pigs and grass, enabling her to quit her farm job so that she can spend more time caring for her children.  Her goal is to start breeding more animals, not just guinea pigs, but also cows, pigs and chickens so that her family can get ahead and become self-sufficient.\r\n<p>\r\nMember Rosal\u00eda C. is 36 years old, married and has a 16 year old daughter.  Her husband works in an auto body shop, repairing and painting cars.  Meanwhile, she works as a domestic helper and also sells Avon cosmetic products and other brands as well.  Her clients are primarily neighbors, friends and acquaintances.  She has been selling cosmetics for 8 years.  When she was younger she previously worked as a temporary employee, a salaried employee, and also in restaurants.  She also takes charge of the domestic duties for her own home. Rosal\u00eda works from 7:30am to 5pm.  She is requesting a loan of $220 to buy Avon products because she sells on credit.  Sometimes the company has promotions, so she can pay for the products now and recoup the costs afterwards when customers make their payments.  She takes orders from her customers every two weeks, which totals between $100-$120, of which 25% is profit.  (That figure is reduced between 5-10% after taking into account the costs of the products.)  This is the first time she has taken out a loan.  In the future she would like to open her own business, such as restaurant, because she enjoys cooking.\r\n<p>\r\nAll members have promised to pay their loans on time and in a responsible manner.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She owns & operates a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Fuatino needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fuatino joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Fuatino's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nSPBD Social Metrics for this Borrower:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

His wife is a manager at a bank, and they both have worked hard to improve their home. Luis has had a taxi business for a number of years where from day to day he travels throughout the capital city of Managua offering his service to customers. On occasion the work is tough, when gasoline is expensive and customers don't want to pay that prices he quotes them, but there are good days when although he is tired he is very satisfied with his profits. His goal is to be able to make improvements to his home, such as replace the walls, paint and add a concrete bathroom since the one they currently have is lined with plastic and is a little uncomfortable while lacking privacy and hygiene, so he sees the improvements as a necessity for his family. Thanks to these loans Luis has been able to make headway as a taxi driver as well as make home improvements, like building the bathroom, for which he'll purchase the construction materials to start the work, including stones, sand, cement, iron, flooring, among other items.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

She also sells soft drinks and dairy products. Susan has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Susan joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Susan has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Susan is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Susan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

To make a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fruits and vegetables in the community.

Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI.

This situation means she needs enough working capital to keep her business going.  She hopes to be able to add to her stock on time, without waiting for the debtors to pay their debts. Awetu is in need of $400 to help her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":15426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Expand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":10,"posted_date":"2007-02-13T21:56:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awetu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-01T00:01:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-04-17T09:10:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-18T04:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13154},{"amount":134,"local_amount":134,"processed_date":"2007-06-17T09:15:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-18T04:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23739},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T09:15:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-18T04:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":32873},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:15:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-18T04:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43565}],"funded_date":"2007-02-15T00:01:32Z","paid_date":"2007-08-17T09:15:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8666,"name":"Jesca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"W. is a married woman with one kid.

She is selling vegetables around the neighborhood on a modified motorcycle. Every day she needs Rp500,000.00-Rp750,000.00 (around $55-$83) for a nett profit of Rp50,000.00 (about $5.50). She is doing this work to add family income. Ms. Yuliati's husband is in the buying & selling motor, and a workshop business with a profit of Rp1,000,000.00 (about $110)\/month. Monthly expenses a month of Rp750,000.00 (about $82.50), and children's education expenses of Rp120,000.00 (about $13.20) are her reasons. The loan will be used in her vegetable sales business; also to finance the motor buying & selling and the workshop. Ms. Yuliati hopes the loan could increase the sales volume, so that her profit could increase to Rp75,000.00 (about $8.25)\/day, and her husband's  business to Rp1,500.000.00 (about $165)\/month.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nIbu Yuliati adalah seorang ibu rumah tangga yang ulet.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and, as a very mountainous area ranging 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level, has many limitations such as the cold, the difficulty to grow crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cVirgen del Rosario\u201d is located at approximately 2,500 meters above sea level in the community of Huanchuy, in the district of Chincho, province of Angaraes. The small town of Huanchuy is located at the border of the Cachi River and used to be an old colonial hacienda. Although the village politically belongs to the region of Huancavelica, all business is done with Ayacucho, the biggest city nearby. Most members of the group have never even been to the capital of their region!\r\n<p>\r\nThe main activities of the population are related to agriculture. The valley of Huanchuy has an excellent climate because of the relatively low altituD. and the availability of water throughout the year. The climate makes it possible to grow a great variety of products like tara and black corn and many fruits and vegetables like avocado, pacay, tuna (prickly pear cactus fruit), sugarcane, carrots, and lettuce. In higher altitudes, the population also grows potatoes. From the tuna cactus comes another product: cochinilla, a small parasite (insect) that is used for its powerful coloring for cosmetics (locals used it to paint their faces or lips in traditional festivals). Besides cultivating all of the mentioned products, most people dedicate their time to raising small animals like guinea pigs, chicken, ducks and rabbits; and bigger animals as cows and bulls. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 3,400 soles (about 1,225 US$). The loans range from 200 up to 600 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save. But all agree to save in the future for reinvestment in their businesses or maybe to buy a community sewing machine. The expectations of the members of the new village bank incluD. receiving trainings on \u201cmarketing\u201d (how to improve their business) and learning how to weave and stitch cloths. Besides that, they think the village bank will be an excellent way to share ideas and experiences.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Nancy. Nancy will receive a loan of 600 soles and runs a small grocery store in the community. With her loan, she will increase her merchandise, buying more soft drinks, beers, sweets, fruits and other groceries. Nancy\u00b4s dream for the future is to have her own sewing business. With FINCA Peru, she wants to learn to save so that she can improve her business and help her father.\r\n<p>\r\nMaura tells another story. She sells vegetables at local weekly markets, going from one to the other. But her main market is the one in Secclla. With her 600 soles loan, she will buy more vegetables like carrots, black potato, celery and onions. Part of what she sells comes from her own small terrain, but she also buys vegetables from other members of the community. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":162975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-05-25T05:42:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Nemensia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edy Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-09T20:11:57Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":204.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-07-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262045},{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-08-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290971},{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-09-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":321363},{"amount":205,"local_amount":568.98,"processed_date":"2008-10-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":569.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":353685},{"amount":200.84,"local_amount":557.43,"processed_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":558.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314370},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":566.65,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":567.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932056}],"funded_date":"2008-05-26T20:11:57Z","paid_date":"2009-01-15T20:37:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":53727,"name":"Samnang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Samnang S. lives in Kngoak Pong Village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

She lives in a town in Saman\u00e1 where she can see the beautiful beaches, and she sees as many tourists as she pleases in the Dominican Republic.  <P>\r\n\r\nLike any Dominican, her favorite foods are rice, chicken, and beans. She has three young adult children aged 20, 25, and 33. When they were little, she worked hard to bring up those future fighters of life. Now is time to fight for her own financial ease.<P>\r\n\r\nWith the help of her small business, she is able to accomplish those desires. She sells hair products to small beauty salons near by: shampoo, conditioner, hair color, and others. Tourists love getting traditional hair styles, and there are also other women living in the same town who come to those beauty salons. Products that are put on their hair are the very products that Ines sells with such love and joy. Today the business has been growing; with the help of her group \"Trabajando para el futuro,\" in time it could be fulfilling.  Stories like hers are an example of what is done thanks to you lenders. \r\n\r\nInes and her story are typical of the \"Trabajando Para el Futuro\" Bank of Hope; she belongs to a group of 20 men and women who work hard to improve their lives with the help of their small loans.  Each of these men and women has taken out a similar loan to that of Ines's, and on behalf of all of them, and our team here at Esperanza, thank you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":193835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To invest in the purchase of more beauty supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Saman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-09-01T07:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emerenciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Licet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eladia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mardanisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Anjela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aniberca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoselin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-16T22:36:07Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":172030,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28671.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28671.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28671.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28671.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":28671.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28671.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":834,"local_amount":28694.6,"processed_date":"2008-10-17T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":28694.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":363200},{"amount":832.67,"local_amount":28648.74,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28648.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312854},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":28671.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":28671.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930401},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":28671.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":28671.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854975},{"amount":833.33,"local_amount":28671.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:11:12Z","rounded_local_amount":28671.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394257},{"amount":833.34,"local_amount":28671.65,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":28671.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085921}],"funded_date":"2008-09-02T22:36:07Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:54:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":66022,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ny C., 45, is a farmer and her husband, Mr. Bouy Morn, is a construction worker.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. Delia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials for making ice candy. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Delia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":455336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

At the same time, he provides taxi services during his free time. Safarboy is asking for a loan of $1500 to buy flour, coal for baking lepeshka, and spare parts to repair his car.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":193885,"name":"Esperanza Nueva 1,3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is the coordinator of her group L.

The members of the group decided to name it that because the area where they live is at the top of a hill and from there you can see a beautiful wooded landscape where the frost does not harm the trees. The group has existed before.\r\n\r\nCarlos is the group\u2019s representative. He says that he is 43 years old and is married to Eulalia. Together they have formed a family of four children who are still dependent upon them, and only one of whom attends school. Carlos is a very hard-working man who always makes sure his family doesn't go without their basic needs. It\u2019s for that reason that he began to raise sheep with his wife two years ago. She takes care of the sheep while he works in another part of the country.\r\n\r\nCarlos is requesting a loan from the institution in order to purchase sheep so that they can raise them and sell them once they are grown. He states that it is somewhat difficult to find a good buyer, because the ones that are usually around pay him very little and that does not do him much good. He states that: \u201cI really like to raise these sheep because they are animals that grow fast and we can sell them when we are going through difficult times or when I am without work.\u201d The only difficulty that he is presented with is when his sheep get sick and die, which for him is a loss of income and investment.\r\n\r\nDespite everything, he has big plans to expand his business. This will help improve his family\u2019s quality of life and his children\u2019s education, which is the most important thing to him.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are Santos,Juan,Bonifacia,Beatriz,Omar,Tomasa, Rosario,and Yonic,who invest in sheep. Epifania, Armando,and Fernando invest in chickens.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1269647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and chickens to raise them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bonifacia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Omar Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yonic ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":64000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":5025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8000},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":628.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":628.12},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":628.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":628.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":628.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":628.12},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":628.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":628.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wright Thompson","image":1216193}},{"id":932292,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a single mother of four children and three go to school.

He and his wife Blanca have 4 children together, all of which are grown up and contribute to their farm. They own a small number of cows and bulls, as well as chickens and other livestock. Like most people in the area, they depend on rice farming for their income. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilman is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor, especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":15468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Prepare his lands for cultivating rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-02-17T18:04:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-06T03:11:38Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T15:04:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13843},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:47:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19617},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T14:05:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26607},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:05:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36154},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:30:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47479},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59572}],"funded_date":"2007-02-20T03:11:38Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:21:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8682,"name":"Chem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chem K., 62, is the landlord of a small rental house in Phnom Penh.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

In San Antonio of Putina ( a province in the region of Puno) there is a town center called La Mina Rinconada (as in Corner Mine, since this is primarily a mining town), this is where Felicita has her store where she sells everything to everybody.  She has been in this business for 15 years and is doing very well, but the increase in the population has caused shortages in her merchandise.  She likes her business and feels that she brings progress to the Mina Rinconada, however, it is hard for her to bring all her products from Juliaca, so she always has to engineer ways to do so.  She wishes to grow her business and increase her merchandise, and thus be able to satisfy the demand of the larger population of Mina Rinconada.  This is the third loan that Felicita has with MFP, she always saves to be able to pay the installments, since she does not want to cause problems to her community bank, where she is one of the happiest and responsible members.

She is 22 years old, and this is her very first loan with Esperanza. Evelin lives with her mother and father, two siblings, and her two children. With her loan, Evelin hopes to expand her business as a shoe saleswoman. Typically, customers will order a certain style or color of shoes, and Evelin will buy them and bring them to the customer\u2019s home. This business plan helps  differentiate her from shoe salespeople who only sell on the street or in shops. Evelin is taking out this loan to help her diversify the selection of shoes available to her customers.<p>\r\n\r\nEvelin hopes that she can continue to receive loans after her first loan is repaid. Eventually, she would like to have her own store and greatly expand her line of offered products. Her children are very young, and Evelin hopes to send them to the best schools possible so they can have businesses of their own when they grow up.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, noodles, salt, eggs, soy sauce, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Stella has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2010, Stella joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Stella is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Stella from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our field partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":489265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Sometimes a person is very well dressed, but turns out that he is not rich.  And sometimes it is the opposite: a person walks by wearing fairly old, worn clothing, but turns out that this is his work uniform, and he is an owner of some type of company.   However it may be, the heroes of our story are ordinary people, those who surround us every day on the street.  But people in this category differ from the gray masses in one aspect, which is the strong will and drive to change their lives for the better.  And their will is expressed in concrete ideas and responsibility.  Take, for example, Duyunbubu D..  She lives in the city of Tokmak together with her daughter, who currently sells souvenirs in the United Arab Emirates.  Duyunbubu is divorced, and at fifty-six years old, in order to support herself and her daughter, she sews traditional goods, also called \u201ctoshoki\u201d (patchwork quilts) in the Kyrgyz language.  When Duyunbubu lost her job, she quickly realized that the time has come to find work for herself and started sewing toshoki for sale.  Now this business yields her around four thousand som ($100) per month.  Duyunbubu requested this loan in order to purchase fabric for sewing in anticipation of the holidays. \r\n\r\nDuyunbubu has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nZina S. is fifty years old.  She is a widow and has four children.  The children are already grown and provide for themselves.  However, Zina is in no way dependent on her children and has her own business.  She sells robes.  The sale of robes yields Zina around ten thousand som per month.  Zina needs a loan in order to purchase a container.\r\n\r\nJyldyzkan J. is forty-four years old.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Jyldyzkan sells traditional goods, such as toshoki, pillows and rugs.  She also has one son, who works as a mechanic at the technical service station.  Jyldyzkan currently needs a loan.  She wants to purchase materials of various colors in order to make rugs.\r\n\r\nNurgul A. is thirty years old.

Rasulov region. Abduvosit has dedicated himself to this business with great effort in order to provide for his wife and three school-aged children. To support his family, he sporadically purchases calves to raise them, fatten them, and then sell them or butcher them to sell the meat. Today, his major need is acquiring a calf for his business. For this reason Abduvosit looks for support to IMON International, to buy more cattle that will make his family\u2019s sustenance possible.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While Alexandra works towards accomplishing her dreams, she continues putting all her efforts into achieving permanent sustainability and growth for her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":774002,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour, corn, sugar and oil in larger quantities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-22T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexandra Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":52436},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":53441},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54466},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55510},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":56574},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":57658},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":58763},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":59889},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":61037},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62207},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":63399},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64620}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":52436,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":54773.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509511},{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":53441,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":55822.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673743},{"amount":31.12,"local_amount":54466,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":56893.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320305},{"amount":31.72,"local_amount":55510,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":57984.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803434},{"amount":32.33,"local_amount":56574,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":59095.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614510},{"amount":32.95,"local_amount":57658,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":60227.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568474},{"amount":33.58,"local_amount":58763,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":61382.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779818},{"amount":34.22,"local_amount":59889,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62558.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188223},{"amount":34.88,"local_amount":61037,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":63757.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324450},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":62207,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64979.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038513},{"amount":73.15,"local_amount":128019,"processed_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":133724.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650704}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T00:13:16Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":304539,"name":"Fouzia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fouzia is a 30-year-old lady.

Lending services in combination with her perseverance, trustworthiness and responsibility have helped to guarantee success in her business.\r\n\r\nYelena is requesting a loan of $1,200 to increase her inventory. She would like to purchase assorted leather gloves at wholesale prices to re-sell in her container-stores. She is able to reduce her transportation expenses by purchasing more inventory in bulk when she travels to remote wholesale centers. Yelena\u2019s long term goal is the continued expansion of her business. She would like to purchase another container-store in the Nikolaev area and eventually open a whole network of leather goods stores in Nikolaev and further away in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

This is 42 year-old Kissa K. from Mbeya. She is single with 2 children, between the ages of 10 and 15. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant because he is an orphan. \r\n\r\nIn 1998 she established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n\r\nHer store also sells second-hand clothes which come across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Kissa currently earns about $120 US from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more used clothes and vitenge in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quality of her business. Kissa thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":425513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more used clothes and vitenge in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T16:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kissa Y.

She is 43, separated, and has 5 children who are 24, 22, 19, 16, and 7.  Four of her children go to school.  She only studied through 6th grade and didn't continue because of a lack of money.  She lives in her own home with her children in Boane and she also supports a nephew and a grandson.  She never moved out of her city.  After she got married, she continued to live in the same district.  She has her own business and has sold from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. for more than 25 years.  She works alone and earns about 4,000 meticais per month.  She manages to save some through a traditional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through friends and neighbors.  This is her 4th loan and it is for 15,000 meticais.  She will use it to purchase construction materials (metals sheets, bricks, cement, and sand) to expand her home.  Her previous loans were for 5,000, 10,000, and 10,000 meticais, all of which were used for her business.  In the future she hopes to request more loans to continue working on her home so she can offer better living conditions to her family and strengthen her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from
