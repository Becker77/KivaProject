The couple has two children, both of whom are college students. She and her husband have worked hard but they had a very small income, and they didn't have enough capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 1997, Nancy heard about the Kiva field partner, ASHI, and began dreaming of having a stable life, a stable home and of starting a business. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, Nancy started her own business of selling fish in the local community. She has had this business for many years. Fish selling has been a great help to her family. As a busy entrepreneur, Nancy also embarked on a tricycle transport business (motorcycle with sidecar). Her husband, Eddie, manages this business.\r\n\r\nHowever, the demands of her family grow as years go by. She wants to have more businesses that can add to her present income so she will have bigger profits and savings. She had the idea of operating a sari-sari (variety) store. It has been great! Nancy is earning a good income and she wants to make a larger investment in it. On her 11th loan, she is proposing a new loan amounting 45,000 PHP to expand her growing variety store business.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of business, Nancy can still manage her previous business of fish selling, because either her children or her husband can operate their sari-sari (variety) store at home when she's away selling fish. Someday, as her income increases, she dreams of funding her children\u2019s education until they complete college degrees and have professional jobs. Her greatest dreams are to get out from the downward spiral of poverty and to have a happy life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":533131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her variety store by purchasing more groceries.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in this business for 7 years and she considers the most difficult aspect of her work to be having to stay in her store all day waiting for customers.  Over time, she would like to set up another business.  She would like to break into the food business as she has seen that it is a good source of income.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's fifth loan with MFP.

Do\u00f1a Amelia is a widow with five children, but she lives alone.  She makes and sells Ocoshal crafts to people in her village who buy it for resale.  Sometimes she travels to Mexico City to sell her products.  She also grows avocados since she sees this is a good business.  She is requesting a loan to buy material for her crafts such as needles, thread and a large tub, as well as avocado plants and organic fertilizer that won't hurt the land.

She and one of her group have been with VisionFund since 2010 while the third member has just joined VisionFund.

It is set up at the meeting point between the mountainous and coastal regions of Ecuador.  Is it an exceptional spot, not just because of its ethnic richness, but also because of the scenery that can be found as soon as you enter this beautiful city.  Santo Domingo de los Colorados is part of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, which was only recently formed.  The main holiday in Santo Domingo is celebrated with a huge wave of visitors and cultural and commercial exchanges.  There is a huge fair at the Rancher's Association's facilities where they show and compete the best specimens of breeds and crossbreeds that are bred in the area's ranches.\r\n\r\nSusana has a grocery store in the Alluriquin neighborhood of her canton.  She started it on her own initiative four years ago and since then the store has been her only means of support.  She wants to take the next step and invest in shelves and products for her store.

He works the route between Dushanbe and Yavan.  This business brings in income, but to increase his earning and reduce the cost of each trip Saidbek wants to install equipment to reduce gasoline consumption.

married.  She has 2 sons.  Her eldest son is 5 years old and is in his third year of primary school.  Her younger son is 4 months old.  Recently, Brenda stopped her studies.  Her intention is to be able to continue to provide for her family, which she is able to do thanks to the income from her\r\nbusiness.  She wishes for her country's economy to improve, and hopes that this improvement would in turn improve her business so that she may achieve the success she needs.  Her dream is for God to grant her a long life so that she may be able to educate her grandchildren and see that they grow up knowing how to succeed professionally and how to handle the difficult situations that they may encounter in their lives.  In the more immediate future, Brenda wishes to move forward with her business, to no longer have sell her food as a street vendor, and to be able to sell her food from her home.  \r\n\r\nBrenda's business is selling the traditional food vigoron.  She sells it on the street, and has run her business for 2 years.  Brenda began her business on her own because the money that her husband earned was not sufficient to cover their household expenses.  Everything relied on the support of her family, who helped her with the business.  Her eldest son helped her to carry her food because she did not have anything that she could use to carry it when she went out to sell.  She and her son would walk the streets looking for customers who would appreciate her delicious vigoron.  Eventually she decided to get a cart to carry her food, because her son was growing tired from carrying it around every day.  Now they carry the cart around together, and it is much easier for them to work.  The loan will provide capital for her business, with which she will buy raw materials such as yucca, pinol sediment, cheese, cabbage, and a knife, so that she may continue to make and sell vigoron every day to her customers.  Brenda says that she is very happy to work with Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and with the friendly organizations who are concerned with the progress of the people and of the country.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":262584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"capital de trabajo ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T01:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brenda Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":856.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400023},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":856.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092021},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":856.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985404},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":856.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446019}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T02:27:32Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":90286,"name":"Marat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marat is married with a 10-year-old daughter.

Estela is very enthusiastic, happy, jovial, and, above all, hard-working.  She is a \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d because she sells all types of handicrafts.  \r\n\r\nShe sells door to door to her friends and acquaintances.  Her products are woven articles.  This work has allowed her to travel to take her products to the provinces.  It has been ten years since she started in this business after studying handicrafts, weavings, and other courses.  \r\n\r\nShe really likes her work because it allows her to have an income, it relaxes her, she gets to know people, and, above all, it helps her husband with the household expenses.  With her work she has obtained economic stability, she lives more peacefully, and she can meet the needs and wants of her children.  \r\n\r\nShe would really like to rent an ample location where she can sell her products.

That experience helped her stay in business and earn income for her home.\r\n\r\nMelissa sells for cash in her general store although she does give short-term credit to her best customers.  Her clientele is composed primarily of housewives that buy from her daily items needed for basic food preparation that she sells at retail in her store.  Men tend to buy the liquor, especially on weekends, and youngsters buy the miscellaneous items like accessories, school supplies, and stationery items.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to turn her store into a big supplier of smaller stores because she knows that this is much needed for it will save store owners transportation costs as well as time and space in their locales.\r\n\r\nWhile all this occurs, Melissa continues working hard to reach her goals and currently has a profit margin of no less than 17.92%, a two-day accounts receivable turnover rate and 24-day stock inventory turnovers.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy snacks, foodstuffs and soft-drinks to stock her store with the items that sell out most quickly and to earn discounts on her purchases for volume and for paying cash.

Paul hopes that in the future he will be able to buy a plot of land and own a bigger shop that sells phones. \r\n\r\nPaul is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Paul who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":955395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more phones for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Iganga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.609167 33.468611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":102071},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":105758},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":109578},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":113536},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":117637},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":121886},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":126288},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":130849},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":135576},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":140472},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":145546},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":150803}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenna & Brenda Shervill","image":158900}},{"id":377991,"name":"Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Petrona de 55 a\u00f1os de edad, madre soltera por viudez, tiene   4  hijos de  28, 32, 35 y 37 a\u00f1os de  edad  y  vive en la aldea la Limonera de Santa Cruz de Yojoa.\nDo\u00f1a Petrona trabaja todo el d\u00eda atendiendo una pulper\u00eda donde vende productos de la canasta b\u00e1sica familiar, como arroz, pan, huevos, refrescos, az\u00facar, harina, churros etc.\nDesde hace tres a\u00f1os  estableci\u00f3 este negocio y ha incrementado el inventario con esfuerzos propios, con la ayuda de un hijo y con los pr\u00e9stamos que ODEF ha otorgado.

He is happy with his work, especially since it is so profitable. As long as his farmland is well-tended, he can harvest all year long. His main difficulty is in dealing with insects that affect his crops. This is Abdurasul first loan from IMON International, and he wants to purchase seeds and fertilizers for his crops.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of low educational attainment due to low economic status, Nema M. and her husband were not able to get good-paying jobs. Therefore, they were not able to support the needs of their three children, especially the financial need to sustain their education until college. Therefore, the same thing happened to their children: they are now 22 to 26 years old and are working as laborers. Nema\u2019s eldest and youngest children are fishermen while her middle and only daughter works as a housemaid. As a mother, Nema felt sad for the lack of achievement by her children. However, despite the hard work her children do every day, they are still happy and are enjoying their lives with their parents. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen Nema joined ASHI in 2006, she and her family were very happy. With the opportunity to receive a loan, their family can have a business that everybody can work in and have earnings from. Since Nema\u2019s two sons are into fishing, Nema decide to support them financially by using the loan from ASHI to make their business grow and become profitable. Now, Nema is requesting for a much larger loan because she wants to purchase a motorboat for her sons to manage. She is the one who sells their fish to people in their village and in the market. \r\n<p>\r\nNema hope that one day their business will be profitable and sustainable enough for her only daughter to work with her in trading their fish instead of working as a housemaid, for which she receives only a very small

Among others, they are: the treasurer, Mrs. Fatma Kon\u00e9 who has been active in the sale of second-hand clothing for two years; Mrs. Khady M., a vendor of ready-to-wear clothing at the central market in Thi\u00e8s for the past two years; Mrs. Magatte M., who has been selling breakfasts and dinners in the front of her house for just one year; and finally Mrs. Fatou M. who has been managing a general grocery store for the past five years.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":542538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Get supplies of various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magatte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":205868,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sonia es soltera, vive en casa de sus padres que esta ubicada en la zona alto Obispo Bosque de la ciudad de La Paz.\nLa se\u00f1ora es empleada de supermercados Ketal y en su tiempo libre se dedica  a realizar masitas (reposter\u00eda).\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para un capital de trabajo (compra de harina, huevos, levadura, etc.) para la elaboraci\u00f3n de masas para pan y galletas y as\u00ed mejorar sus ingresos.\nEsta es la primera  ocasi\u00f3n que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo y el an\u00e1lisis socioecon\u00f3mico realizado la califica favorablemente y puede acceder  a un  cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Sonia is single and lives with her parents in the Obispo Bosque highland zone of the city of La Paz.

Her activity was marked by her designer's approach and personal advice to every client. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, in order to broaden her business, Aygul obtained her first loan of 20,000 KGS from Bai Tushum and Partners, which was repaid without any delays.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In order to save her business, she is now leading a group of three members to take a Kiva loan via VisionFund, and she is willing to use her loan portion to buy fertilizer which expected to increase her crop yields. She hopes that this loan will help to grow her crop well and gain her more income.

Usaha yang ditekuni sejak masih remaja ini awalnya hanya untuk dipasarkan disekitarnya saja tetapi lama-kelamaan karena banyak yang memerlukan bantuan untuk dipasarkan lebih luas akhirnya dengan modal hanya Rp.500.000,- awalnya, Putu menampung hasil karya dari para tetangganya dan kemudian dijualnya di pasar tradisional kota. Per ikatnya Putu biasanya membeli seharga Rp.7000,- dan kemudian dijualnya di pasar seharga Rp.10.000,- sampai Rp.15.000,- tergantung situasi banyaknya upacara yang terselenggara. Dengan pinjaman modal dari DINARI melalui program Tempek, Putu mampu meningkatkan omset jual beli tempat bantennya dengan cara mengambil hasil karya sampai keluar dari desanya dan memang sudah menjadi langganan tetap dari Putu. Pinjaman ini berjangka waktu selama 12 bulan dengan pengembalian dicicil setiap bulannya. Dengan bertambahnya modal tentunya hasil penjualannya juga bertambah dan keuntungan yang didapatpun lumayan besar sehingga dapat membantu suaminya yang hanya mengandalkan hasil dari kebun yang diolahnya. Keuntungan ini sedikit demi sedikit ditabung untuk keperluan anaknya nanti karena memang sekarang Putu masih belum dikaruniai seorang anak. Program DINARI ini sangat penting pengaruhnya terhadap taraf ekonomi keluarga Putu Supartini untuk mencukupi biaya kebutuhan sehari-hari yang dirasakan semakin tinggi saja.","en":"Even though Putu Supartini is still young, she is very keen in running her small business: \u201cMejejaitan\u201d production. \u201cMejejaitan\u201d is a plate to put Balinese ceremonial offering (\u201cBanten\u201d), knitted from coconut leaves. Putu Supartini has started her business since she was very young. She started to produce \u201cMejejaitan\u201d by her own, and market her product to her neighbor, but then because of the increasing demand, she started to need helpers. With Rp 500,000 at the beginning, she purchased finished \u201cMejejaitan\u201d from her neighbor, and then sell them in the nearby traditional market. Putu pays Rp 7,000 for a bunch of \u201cMejejaitan\u201d, and sell it for Rp 10,000 up to Rp 15,000, according to the ceremonial session. With loan from DINARI through Tempek Program, Putu was able to increase her revenue. The loan is a 12 months loan with monthly installment. With higher capital, Putu Supartini is able to earn more income that she is able to help her husband, a farmer who only count on the result of their garden, to fulfill their family\u2019s daily needs.\r\n\r\nRight now Putu Supartini and her husband have not had any children yet, but they are saving some of their income to be able to fund their children\u2019s tuition fee in the future. Loan from DINARI through Tempek Program is very important for Putu Supartini\u2019s economics to fulfill her family daily needs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Hestyana Dyah

Murotali is 42 years old. He is married with 6 adorable children. Murotali has always opted to make his life on his land, grow on it, and work hard. That is how he decided to rear cattle and dedicate himself to agriculture. He has been doing this kind of work for a very long time for he comes from a family with an entirely agricultural background. Today Murotali wishes to increase the number of his animals; he would like to buy cattle with the hope of increasing his income and the well-being of his family with the innumerable benefits that these special little animals provide him. That is why he is requesting a loan of $1000 USD. Extend your solidarity to Murotali so that he can move forth successfully and accomplish all his goals.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture selling fruit.  Suiti has many years of experience in this business.  Suiti needs a loan of WST $2500 .  She plans to use the earnings from her business to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSuiti joined SPBD.This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Suiti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Suiti K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Ivo joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ivo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

When she was a young girl she learned about agricultural work. Today, with her husband and children by her side, she works on the land that was inherited to her by her parents. She is able to earn enough to support herself and her family. She cultivates potatoes, corn, okra, fava beans and other products, such as hay that she uses for her livestock.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

Microfinance institutions such as TYM Fund allow Mrs. Kim to have small repayments.  This is one idea that Mrs. Kim likes the most because it helps her to save more.  Mrs. Kim's group includes:\r\n\r\n<p>T. Thi Xam (born in 1966), D. Thi Chinh (born in 1971), D. Thi Thong (born in 1960), and L.

For the past 7 years she has sold meat and cheese which she distributes in her home town's main market.  She sells her product daily but on each Thursday of the week she travels to her home town to replenish her supply of cheese.  She also sells fresh-water trout which she buys fresh and sells on the week-end.  Because of the good quality of her products, her sales have been increasing little by little which encourages her to continue her work.

He is 49 years old, married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, he owns and operates a specialized retail shop where he sells seafood products such as dried fish and shrimp. Eduardo has been in his business for more than four years and earns approximately 5,200 PHP a month from his work.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Eduardo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his life and business opportunities. He has applied for a loan, his first, for 5,000 PHP to buy additional products to sell. He plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to support the education of children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

There are two in college, three in high school and three still in elementary school.  Since they have bonded well, cooperate and help each other, some of her children contribute to their income when they sell candy and junk food in their school during vacant time.\r\n\r\nJosefa's husband works their field planting corn and rice. During harvesting, they sell some of their products to have money for their children's tuition and some of their harvested rice is for their food. The couple also plants vegetables in a small area of their field and in their backyard in order to minimize their food expenses. Josefa's income from her general store is insufficient if she counts the expense for her pig feed. Josefa needs additional capital amounting Php 6,000 to buy additional items for her general store to gain a bigger income for her family.

In the future, she hopes to have a hardware store where she can offer additional items related to construction for sale.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She knows that this money will help her to have a better future, but she also remembers that she must make her payments on time so as to avoid problems with her communal bank.

A. is a widow with 6 children who make up her family. At the age of 65, she lives in the Quiroga neighborhood of Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia. Her work is selling groceries in a small store she owns. She began as a businesswoman dealing in handicrafts, especially the production of brooms and artificial flowers. Out of this grew the desire to have her own store, which she began in her home using her own resources as well as a loan of 1,000,000 Colombian pesos granted to her by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation in 2003. Since that time, she has received 8 loans, and she has always been careful to repay them on time. She has invested them in her business and also in improvements to her home. Currently, she is requesting financing in the amount of 2,200,000 Colombian pesos for improvements to her home. These funds will be used to replace the roof, repair the pipes and paint the doors and window frames. With respect to the social benefit of the loan, Ligia says that credit from the Foundation has helped her to grow personally along with her business. The business is the main source of her income, and she has gradually been able to renovate her home. She wants to continue expanding her small business and stock it with products that her customers need. \r\n\r\nThe challenges she has faced have included the loss of loved ones such as her husband, her mother and her son-in-law, which she must overcome although they are irreplaceable. \r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

Then because of a change in housing, she decided to sell fried foods. Time passed, and still sales were low, so she opened up the corner store once again and now sells a variety of products that are needed on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nMartha runs the store in the living room of their house which means that the family has less space and less privacy.

After the death of his father, he decided to stop his education and start working to earn income for his family. He started working as a constructor specialized on gypsum board work. He works with his brothers to cover the family expenses, home rental, hospitality expenses etc. He has been involved in his occupation for the past 5 years and he has been able, despite his young age, to build a good business reputation where a lot of entrepreneurs ask for his construction services. He is asking to borrow $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase additional construction tools because his work is increasing and he needs to be prepared for any new projects.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\n\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

Every day is different for this agricultural worker. He gets up when the sun rises and sets out to take care of his fields. After spending the morning carefully tending his potato and olluco (root crop) plants, he is ready to head back to his rams waiting in the stable. He takes them out to graze, accompanied and supported by his wife. He says he likes agricultural work a lot because it is quite gentle and profitable. He manages to sell the potatoes and olluco he grows at reasonable prices. Whenever he goes through a period of crop shortage or has any debt outstanding, he sells some of his animals at the market in the city. He has many plans for the future, among them to purchase a plot of land on which to sow in large quantities, as he wants to increase his profits. This is his tenth loan with MFP, and he promises to make all his repayments on time because he wishes to continue working to move forward. He is also very satisfied with the work of his group because it is made up of quite responsible people. Alberto plans to invest the loan requested in the purchase of manure and fertilisers, as he wants to make his next growing season more fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Stansfield, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":590457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertiliser.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:05Z","rounded_local_amount":560,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588550}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T19:55:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Stansfield","image":null}},{"id":230482,"name":"Jeanette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanette A. is from Gala, Ozamiz City.

They have three children: one in college, another in high school, and the youngest in elementary school. \r\n<p>\r\nLuisa is a persevering entrepreneur, juggling three small-scale businesses at one time. She buys and sells laptops; she runs a sari-sari (variety) store and sells school supplies; and she manages a burger, siomai, and mami stand. All of these products Luisa offers to her neighbors and to everyone in the community who find these products worth their money. Given these three businesses, Luisa earns around 10,000 PHP monthly.\r\n<p>\r\nTo continue her business operations, Luisa applied for a 36,000 PHP loan. She plans to use the loan to purchase additional stock for her variety store and food stand businesses. She believes that through her perseverance and being a faithful steward, God will bless her businesses and establish them successfully. Luisa dreams that with her businesses going strong and gaining, her children will be able to finish their college education and get stable jobs someday. \r\n<p>\r\nLuisa faithfully attends her weekly fellowship meetings together with her co-members of Center for Community Transformation (CCT).

Her husband was an alcoholic and left the family 7 years ago. As the one left with the responsibility of raising her children, Olga was forced to find ways to provide for her family. The owner of the grocery store where she worked was moving to a different city and decided to sell the store. Olga took a risk and used her savings to purchase the store which is located on one of the main highways in town. \r\n\r\nLending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have helped promote the growth of Olga\u2019s business. She was able to remodel the interior of the store and hire three people to help her run it. Olga received her first loan in 2005 and since then has never had a single late payment \u2013 even when it\u2019s been freezing cold and her sales were down. The loans have enabled Olga to increase her business income allowing her to buy a comfortable, private home for her family.\r\n\r\nOlga is requesting a loan of $1,200 to expand the selection of groceries in her store. She is planning to introduce new items and purchase assorted cereals, fruits, dairy products, bread and beverages that always sell well with travelers in Ukraine. As a very intelligent, hard-working entrepreneur, Olga is a woman people look up to in her community. Her good reputation and customer-friendly service have a very positive impact on her business. Increased funding will help ensure her ongoing success and continue to improve the quality of life for her family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u2013

He also does the marketing for the business.\r\n\r\nShe is on her 4th cycle loan from AFSG, and these loans have enabled her to grow her business. Now she is able to continue her studies that she missed during the Taliban years. She could not have done this without the help of the AFSG loan program. She is requesting another loan of $400 to further expand her business and improve her family's standard of living and education.\r\n\r\nNote: The picture featured in this business profile is the brother of Samira.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":204322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chicks and feed for her poultry business and hair products for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T03:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T04:38:31Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347989},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970563},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886780},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436040},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130313},{"amount":69.99,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027143},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613183},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010266},{"amount":70.01,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232577},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664393}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T04:38:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Barbara Standley","image":834286}},{"id":69870,"name":"Abdumutalib","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"L.

Her two older children are twins who are currently in their fourth year of high school.  \r\n<p>\r\nDelfina works for MINED (the Ministry of Education) as an elementary school teacher in the Serrano neighborhood.  She has been teaching for four years and her school is located 28km away from the city.  At the moment, she is requesting her ninth loan to invest in home improvements (specifically the construction of a room).  Every day, Delfina wakes up at 4am to complete her household chores before catching a passenger truck at 6am to leave for her teaching job.  Even though he does not live with them, the father of her children is very responsible and contributes toward their expenses.  Delfina hopes that her children continue to study, find work, and remain healthy.  She also wants to improve their living conditions so that they will be more comfortable.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva
