At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAlicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viands in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 27,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her child a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":918557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-19T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":182.29,"local_amount":7875,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7881.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529514},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4503.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738730},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4503.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145962},{"amount":130.2,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5629.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274996},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4503.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997713}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T20:21:44Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":362119,"name":"Wehoya Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Receive greetings from Wehoya Group in Western Kenya!

Con el \u00e1nimo de seguir adelante con sus vacas, Diana aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una vaca lechera la cual le genere mayores ingresos para su hogar.\nDiana espera que de esta manera sus ingresos mensuales no se vean afectados por la compra de la vaca y pueda tener mejores ingresos para ofrecer a sus padres mejor calidad de vida y para poder progresar econ\u00f3micamente. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1011089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de una vaca lechera la cual le genere mayores ingresos para su hogar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89095},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91610},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":94196},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96855},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99589},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":102400},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":105290},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":108262},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":111318},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":114460},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117691},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":121013},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":124429},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":127941},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":131553},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":135266},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":139084},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":143010},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147047},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151198},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":155466},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":159854},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":164366},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":169007}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.88},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.02},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.57},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.51},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.55},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.65},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.04},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.68},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.14},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":993939,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco continua con sus estudios en ciencia de la educaci\u00f3n, esta poniendo su mayor esfuerzo para poder lograr su meta de ser alguien en la vida, y por medio de sus conocimientos poder abrirse camino al mundo laboral.

Peru\u2019s national dish, consists of fresh fish, lime, and spices, and anyone who is planning to prepare this delicious and healthy meal can stop by Sonia\u2019s stand in the fish market to buy all the necessary ingredients in one trip. Located just inside the door of the local fish market in Ayacucho, Per\u00fa, Sonia provides the lime, onions, tomatoes, spices, lettuce, chilies, and everything else used to prepare both ceviche and fried fish, another Peruvian favorite. Her clients consist of everyone from mothers shopping for the day\u2019s meal to large seafood restaurants. Every single day of the week, one can find Sonia at her stand, with her busiest days being Saturday and Sunday when the largest shipments of fish arrive from the coastal capital of Lima. <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough she loves ceviche and loves her job, Sonia\u2019s aspirations lie in a different field. One day, she says she would love to open a store specializing in spices. There is much more demand and the prices are higher in this market, she explains. The larger profit potential would be especially welcome in Sonia\u2019s household these days as she has two little daughters ages 3 and 4. Everything she does is for her daughters and she works and saves diligently to be able to provide a better life for the two of them. <P>\r\n\r\nSonia\u2019s participation in her village bank is what has helped her grow her business and earn capital for the past 4 years, as she works towards the many goals she has set for herself and her business. She says she loves to be involved because her village bank has taught her how to save her money in the bank where it safely accumulates interest. There she has also learned the value of punctuality and responsibility. Sonia is currently requesting a loan of US$ 425. This money she will invest in a car which will greatly help her in the purchase and shipment of the products she sells daily."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":88326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To invest in a car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-25T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-09T03:27:06Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-01-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112783},{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-02-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132131},{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-03-09T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153930},{"amount":104,"local_amount":293.65,"processed_date":"2008-04-09T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":310.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178115}],"funded_date":"2007-11-25T03:27:06Z","paid_date":"2008-04-09T09:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29355,"name":"Umarboi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umarboi U. lives in B.Gafurov Rayon; he is divorced and has 2 children.

After his military retirement, Boubou D. is returning to one of his money-making businesses, poultry-farming, which he learned from a friend for over two years. With the intention of growing his business, he decided to join microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso who has just granted him his first loan. He plans to buy 200 chicks, 8 feeding troughs, 8 drinking troughs, 2 boxes of vaccines, 20 bags of vitamins, and 1400 kilograms of feed. He gets his supplies from Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali.

The children's father abandoned the family many years ago, and now she lives with her new partner, Omar, with whom she also had a child, but sadly the baby died shortly after. It was a Thursday morning and like always she left to sell pineapple slices and tamales from her basket, not knowing that her son would fall into the river. After many days of looking, the body was found, and Giovana wanted to day and not work anymore. But she still had her other two children, and for them she tried to resume her activities. In the morning, she prepares their breakfast and lunch before leaving to sell her foods to drivers passing by. She really enjoys the activity, even though she says there's a lot of competition and sometimes she has trouble selling all of her tamales, which she then keeps for herself, and her earnings drop. After the hardship she endured, she tries to stay strong and work for her children. With the loan she is requesting, she will invest in the purchase of pineapples and other fruits to open a juice stand at a small rented storefront.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":215363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Start a juice stand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T04:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-09T12:42:55Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957455},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227705},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422940},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116164},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011124},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594727},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989246},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":104.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210579}],"funded_date":"2008-10-26T11:42:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":74434,"name":"Mrs. Oun Chhoen Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank consisting of sixteen people is located in Kandal Kraom village in Kandal Province.

Thanks to the house she was able to acquire 10 years ago she can provide her family with comfort and security.  She is very well known for her ambition within the area where she lives, as she can be seen every afternoon leaving with her food cart that she moves from her house to the corner where she attends to customers from 6:00 pm until very late at night.  She works selling her delicious hamburgers at a reasonable price in order to attract the clientele to guarantee that her business grows.  Even though sales have been increasing, Ylicia is planning to open a bookstore in her home, and counts on her husband's support, as he is investing in her business.  However, they still have not collected enough money to buy the furniture and merchandise, making it necessary that she keep working selling food until they have the needed capital for their future business.  This is her first loan with MFP, and the money will be used to buy merchandise for her upcoming bookstore, in which she has placed all her hopes and desires of having a stable business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":306855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise to start a bookstore","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ylcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125.37},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131.68},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":137.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.74},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":157.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":163.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":173.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.95},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":125.37,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":128.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596094},{"amount":43.89,"local_amount":131.68,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":135.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990358},{"amount":45.97,"local_amount":137.91,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":141.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211482},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":142.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":146.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640987},{"amount":48.49,"local_amount":145.46,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":149.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080453},{"amount":50.95,"local_amount":152.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":157.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996612},{"amount":52.46,"local_amount":157.39,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":161.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842128},{"amount":168.87,"local_amount":506.61,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":520.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733791}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T22:41:47Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":107202,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene D. lives in Lower Lamac, Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental.

","en":"Godefroid K. sells various goods, such as soap, canned foods, sugar, vegetable oil, school supplies, etc... in Kingasani, which is located on the north side of the city of Kinshasa and its most populated part.  He started the business by selling sweet beverages in 2001 with $20 in initial capital.  From 2001-2005, it was prosperous, enabling him to open a small general store. Through decisive effort and accumulated profits, he was able to amass $250 of working capital this year. \r\n\r\nGodefroid intends to use the loan of this May to buy merchandise to bolster his inventory in order to satisfy the needs of his customers for sugar and lollipops.  He's running into difficulties due to electric power outages occurring at awkward moments.  But he uses blocks of ice to cool his drinks just the way his customers like it.  Currently, his business produces $144 in profits a month.  He hopes to make more than that in the near future because his ambition is to open a cold room to store fresh foodstuff for customers with the goal of growing his revenues. \r\n\r\nGodefroid has been a member of a HOPE RDC group named \"La Rose\" since 2008.  He is 42 years old, married, and the father of four children, ranging in age from 2 to 12.

She is 43 years old. Wilfreda is widowed and has four adult children. To make a living, Wilfreda owns & operates a business where she sells bananas and vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling bananas and vegetables in the local community. Wilfreda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wilfreda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilfreda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Wilfreda is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Wilfreda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with her husband in Siem Reap province. She owns a business producing Cambodian traditional cakes, typically earning $1 per day. Her husband\u2019s business is the primary source of income for her family. He is a construction worker, typically earning $4 per day.\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis has been difficult for businesses in Cambodia this past year. This factor has played into a difficult economic year for many, S. included. The country's economic struggles always seem to affect the poor the most.

24-year-old high-school graduate preparing for university. Ayoubah cares for his two younger brothers. He lives and works on Randall Street, a district in downtown Monrovia, Liberia. Randall Street is a very popular street when it comes to business.\r\n\r\nAyoubah's business is in selling building materials. He buys these materials in wholesale and sells in retail to people who work in small construction. He started this business six years ago and is doing well, but shortage of goods on the market makes business difficult for Ayoubah.\r\n\r\nAyoubah is proud of the quality goods he supplies to his customers. He hopes eventually to own a big construction store and to become a successful businessman. He is requesting this loan to purchase more building materials in order to acquire more of a profit. His dream is to achieve a better level of education and to provide a good future for the children he will someday have."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":394835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She has been engaged in her fishing business for more than ten years and also gets involved in bamboo set making as another source of household income.\r\n\r\nShe plans to utilize this loan of 10,000 PHP to expand her fishing business and to continue to be involved in other businesses for supplementary profits. This loan will be used to buy secondhand fish cages, bamboo and fingerlings (small fish). She believes that her business will help her family to rise up and fight against poverty.\r\n\r\nDuring her one year as a member of ASHI, Pacita has shown very good performance with her group mates and at the center. Having this loan will enable her to finally achieve her dreams in life: to have a successful business, a better life and a happy family as well. She is very thankful to ASHI and KIVA services for the continued support of her

because it was fun. It just came easy to me.\u201d  \r\n\r\nCombining a natural talent with metal, an eye for design, and his enthusiasm for off-road vehicles, Joey opened his own custom welding and metals fabrication shop, Infamous Metal Works. \r\n \r\nOver the past several years, Joey has built a dedicated client base, first by taking on side-work for customers while working at a metal fabrication shop, and now through his own business. These loyal customers, now friends, strongly encouraged Joey to start his business when the opportunity presented itself in 2007. Their support, as well as the customer referrals they send, has been critical over the past two years, and Joey has built up a brand name for himself without putting much effort into marketing. \r\n \r\nIn the next year, he would like to increase sales through his website and to hire another employee to help him and his two part-time workers to manage the increasing work load. \r\n\r\n\u201cI wish I could say that I make my own schedule, but I\u2019m here 10-14 hours a day, 7 days a week. There\u2019s always something to do, whether it\u2019s helping customers, ordering parts, or setting up the machines.\u201d \r\n \r\nA $10,000 loan will allow Joey to purchase a steel-cutting machine that will expand his design capabilities and attract new customers. \r\n\r\n\u201cI can design a part on my computer, and then use the machine to cut it into the steel. It will open a lot of doors to grow my business.\u201d

She is 55 years old. Rita is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRita is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Rita owns & operates a business selling fish in the local community. Rita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Rita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital. Rita is requesting a new loan of 10,500 PHP, which will be used as additional capital in expanding the business. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Rita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living standard of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Salima is 16 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera, in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.  Salima has a business managing a small retail shop in Kyotera.  Despite her very young age, Salima has had her business for about three years.    \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Salima is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more inventory, which Salima will be able to sell at her retail shop. She hopes to create a strong business and to save profits in order to support herself in the future.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access financing at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future. It is targeting a segment of the population that is not typically served by traditional microfinance organizations. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans. It gives Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and to support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

He owns a grocery store and has been in the business for 3 years.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Luis set up his business with his own capital and gradually stocked his store.  He was 25 when he started the business, having previously been employed as a worker in a company.  Jos\u00e9 Luis' wife helps him to serve in the business.  They provide their services to people who work in the local cigar factory and support each other in serving the customers.  They have hopes that their business will prosper and gain a better inventory of products that people regularly buy.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Luis is requesting this loan so that he can buy essential food products such as meat, basic grains, bread and vegetables.  He thereby hopes to increase his number of customers and also his sales.  One of his future plans is to convert his business into a mini-supermarket that sells all kinds of products.  His next goal is to save enough money so that he can pay for his [9-year-old] eldest daughter's medical treatment and continue to invest in his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":728108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She began working in her house where she would meet her clients with an enormous and happy smile making them feel comfortable while they wait to be attended to. Janixi began when she was seventeen years old and since then she has liked embellishing people. From the outset she has counted on the support of her mother who has been her greatest strength and raised her alone. Previously Janixi sold cosmetics and clothing with her mother and even today she sells beauty products and cosmetics in her salon.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Every day he begins work very early in the morning, and he works as much as 12 hours a day, and he thinks it is going well because of his performance and responsibility.\r\n\r\nRoger is very thankful for the lenders at Kiva, since it is thanks to their help that he will be able to open his own small auto repair shop, and in a short while, Roger hopes to have a good customer base to advance his business, with which Roger wants to expand his business and assure the education and well-being of his child."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1231955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to open his own auto repair shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":32.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":48.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":59.86},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":64.99},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67.7},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":70.73},{"due_date":"2013-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.12},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.92},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.81},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.68},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.53},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Mount","image":473338}},{"id":993955,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George is taking another loan because his 1st Kiva loan played an instrumental role in his business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They live in the Nonodel sector, which is about 30 minutes outside of the city of Cuenca.  They meet outdoors surrounded by natural scenery where Nature is seen in all her splendor and natural state.\r\n\r\nRosa Le\u00f3n, 29, lives with her life partner and their 5 children, who are 10, 8, 5, 3, and 1 years old.  Her oldest three children are enrolled in the Martin Huelte elementary school, which is in Rumipamba; it\u2019s a 30-minute walk to school.  Her husband works hauling lumber.  They own their own house which they built with lots of love and which reflects all their hard work.\r\n\r\nRosa farms and works three days a week either taking in laundry or working her neighbors\u2019 fields; her cousin takes her to work because she has many contacts who request their services.  In addition, she raises guinea-pigs and chickens, both for her own personal consumption and to sell in the city of Cuenca.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the Foundation; her sister-in-law encouraged her to be part of a communal bank.  The loans have gradually helped her to get ahead in her home.  The loan she will get now will be used to buy chickens, guinea-pigs and animal feed.\r\n\r\nHer great dream is that her children study and get ahead in life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She lives in her own home and wants to work hard so she can progress in life.  Since she was little, she has worked with her parents cultivating their land.  Over the years, she has been able to buy her own land and now she is one of the primary growers of bananas and coffee in the Chanchamayo province, a place known for its agricultural products.  Her favorite part of her job is taking care of her products which she does lovingly; she has done this work for 15 years and feels like the most difficult part is taking the products to market.  It is very difficult to find trucks that are willing to carry the heavy sacks of crops.  Over time, she hopes to buy more land in order to increase her production.  This is her 3rd loan through MFP and she is confident that she will pay it back punctually as she has always done.  In her village bank, she is a very happy and unified member.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rosemary thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":215461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy cloth and shoes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T02:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T05:23:33Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970682},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886899},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436159},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130432},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027234},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613268},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010351},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232662},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664478},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105223}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T04:23:33Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":74466,"name":"Menssan","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ag\u00e9 de 61 ans, Monsieur K.

Estela owns a small colmado, what the locals call a small general store. Colmados can sell anything from laundry detergent to soft drinks, and typically there is one on each street in a neighborhood. Estela sells several things in her colmado, including medications, clothing, and foods typical of the Dominican cuisine such as rice, beans, bread, and oil for cooking.\n\nEstela is very thankful for this loan, her fifth with Esperanza. She has a perfect track record so far, and the experience with her loans is helping her to expand her business. With this loan, Estela is going to purchase prepaid cell-phone cards to sell to people in her neighborhood. Rather than having cell-phone \u201cplans\u201d, most Dominicans use prepaid cards, so her products will be in high demand.\n\nEstela has already helped her daughter attend university, and she hopes that this loan will help her granddaughter have the same future.

Zenaida is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used as working capital, and to purchase additional inventory. This will be the third loan Zenaida has taken out through GDMPC.

Cristina runs a small business selling groceries and basic necessities. It is located in her home in the town of El Alto. She works there every day in order to earn money to support her son. They live in a small house which they own. Cristina hopes to expand the business gradually and to relocate to bigger premises so that she can continue helping her family to get ahead. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the group works at a variety of jobs such as selling food in the streets or from a stall; one woman sells supplies on credit, and another sells clothing also on credit. The group has a lot of business experience and is well-known for being knowledgeable. Although competition is very stiff, the group has both experience and regular customers  who know their work and request their services. They are also enthusiastic about what they do since their income is vital for their families. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used for working capital, to buy merchandise, supplies, and tools. The group hopes to expand their businesses and generate more income to buy their own homes, have more financial stability, and a better quality of life. The community bank already has a lot of experience with loans as this is their fifth loan. They have always been punctual with their repayments and shown themselves keen to make progress.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

C. is 61 years old, married, and lives in the Villa Las Moras neighborhood in the municipality of Soledad.  She sells general merchandise such as clothing and cosmetics, and she also markets products in large quantities such as cooking oil, rice, soap and skin creams.  She has worked with the Fundaci\u00f3n for more than 7 years.  She started out working in a solidarity group, but as her business was growing she became independent and acquired her own credit account.  She now requests a loan in the amount of $2,000.00 which she will use to buy products in large volume, such as cooking oil, rice, soap and foodstuffs to supply to stores and to meet the demands of some housewives.\r\n\r\nHer family raised livestock in the Magdalena department (region), but for questions of security they sold the house in that town and when they arrived they bought another in the Siete de Abril neighborhood of  Barranquilla.  From there they began to sell gold and silver jewelry, but their first business was a store, which they closed because they were not familiar with the way that the market works in Barranquilla; later they started to sell merchandise in Pelayo in the Cesar department with a friend, with whom they shared the profits. They traveled to Maicao (a municipality of Colombia located on the Venezuelan border) in order to buy electric appliances such as blenders, fans, irons, etc.  In her business they have two markets: the main one is selling to stores that sell food products, and the second is selling directly to housewives. This second market, although it generates a higher return, is conducted on a smaller scale.  These housewives live in other communities because she does not want to compete with the stores where she sells her products; she does not want to lose them as customers since they generate a good cash flow, so in this way she cares for her market.  In the future, her goal is to improve her home and her main challenge is to build a second floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Tinago, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental, in the Philippines. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buying and selling coffee, juice and personal products, and a piggery business. Regina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Regina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 (Philippine pesos) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for the personal product business and buy medicines and vaccines for the pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Regina S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and the mother of two children. Her husband works as an auditor. She works for a private company as a credit analyst.\r\n\r\nShe has her own house, which she built alongside her husband to benefit the whole family. They managed thanks to savings and loans acquired through financial services companies. Her goal is to support her mother, who is very ill and lives in a house that's in very poor condition as it's made of wood. With the loan she will be able to replace the roof and build concrete walls, which will give her mother better, more hygienic housing. For Martha this is an investment as it is part of the family's assets. \r\n\r\nShe doesn't have all the capital she needs for this project and that's why she's requesting the financial support of Afodenic in order to make the improvements and begin the works to improve the roof."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":864327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building materials to build a concrete house, with a better roof and more hygiene.

Daina is the facilitator of Tushirikiane B group. This  group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nDaina takes care of five children at home. She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Daina had a very good maize yield harvesting 16 bags on 1 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Daina was only able to harvest 5 bags of maize on 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Daina and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Daina will educate her children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing. In 2012, the members of Tushirikiane B group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":935175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-05T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Belina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":53900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":625,"local_amount":53900,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":55937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681249}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T18:41:42Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":370360,"name":"Isabel Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Isabel , es habitante del municipio de Ticuantepe , junto a su familia , los planes a futuros es poder mejorar las condiciones de vida, do\u00f1a Isabel cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo ya que trabaja en una empresa privada y esto le permite que los gastos de dividan en el hogar , do\u00f1a Isabel  lleva muchos a\u00f1os laborando como com\u00e9rciate y a la vez para una empresa privada , ellos dos se esfuerzan mucho para poder construir su vivienda , pero todav\u00eda no les ajusta para comprar de una sola vez materiales de construcci\u00f3n y asi cumplir sus sue\u00f1os de tener un techo digno y gozar de privacidad .

Now, she forms a group of two to get a new loan. As the leader, she will spend her entire loan portion to buy fertilizer, insecticide, and to pay for labor cost.

To pay for his tuition costs, Mario bought clothes and sold them to his friends, and little by little, he soon made some money.

Six of her children are currently enrolled in school. Betty has been running a mixed farm for over ten years just outside of Kitale, Kenya, in the western region of the country. She sells maize, milk, and cereals as the primary source of her income, while also earning money selling second-hand clothes and blankets in her town. She says that the main challenge right now is occasional bouts of disease spreading through her livestock.\r\n\r\nBetty recently completed her first loan with Juhudi Kilimo for KES 30,000, and has now requested this loan for KES 50,000 to expand her stock of poultry and acquire necessary farm supplies. She also wants to use a portion of the loan for school fees for her children, as she repeatedly stresses the importance of education. She says that the extra income from this loan will hopefully enable her to send all of her children through school, and eradicate poverty in her family. In the future, she would like to continually improve on her farming abilities and provide for her extended family.\r\n\r\nBetty is thus far very pleased with her association with Juhudi Kilimo\/Kiva. She is proud of the changes she has witnessed in her own family and her town, and hopes that one day all of her needs will be met through continued cooperation with

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For lack of adequate working capital, Beatrice buys few extras of lace materials and sells through hawking. She believes the loan will enable her to grow her business to the expected level. With the loan, she wants to purchase bulk lace materials and textiles.

His wife sells clothing and shoes and, together, they have managed to raise their four children, two of whom are adults and two are still minors.  His goal is to continue to make improvements to his small house which, up to now, he has only been able to do thanks to these loans because the recent hikes in fuel costs in the country have made transportation costs for people much higher.  Therefore, passengers tend to forego taxi rides and opt for the less expensive choice, the bus.  He is making barely enough to cover basic needs like food.  With this loan request he will buy building materials like: stone, sand, cement and iron to build a wall so that his property and his family will be more secure since his current fencing is merely small, old pieces of zinc metal sheeting which he hopes to improve soon and bit by bit close everything off.  He would also like to install a sewer drain for better hygiene so that his children can have a worthy home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":471172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building supplies like: stone, sand, cement and iron, to build a wall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-16T19:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionicio Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.64,"local_amount":1203,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1203.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841580},{"amount":57.43,"local_amount":1198.56,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874505},{"amount":61.78,"local_amount":1289.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604376},{"amount":60.3,"local_amount":1258.39,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639846},{"amount":58,"local_amount":1210.35,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1211.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821625},{"amount":55.12,"local_amount":1150.25,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1150.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561634},{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":1195.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1196.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770563},{"amount":57.35,"local_amount":1196.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1197.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204457},{"amount":110.08,"local_amount":2297.44,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2298.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330170}],"funded_date":"2010-01-16T23:57:03Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":173153,"name":"Batzul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batzul is 32 years old and lives alone in a house in the Bayanzurh district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.\r\n\r\nBatzul operates a taxi service in his town.

Despite these difficulties, Eladia runs a successful business selling seafood. The area is known for its fishing industry, and since it is a peninsula, the demand for and availability of fish is quite high. With this loan, Eladia will catch and purchase fish, shrimp, and crab to sell for a small profit.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is Eladia\u2019s ninth loan with Esperanza International. With her profits, she hopes to buy a small boat so she can catch more of her own seafood, giving her a greater profit margin. She also will buy her children school supplies, including notebooks, shoes, and backpacks. With continued investments into her business, Eladia hopes to one day have her own home. With your loan, Eladia will be well on her way to reach these goals.<P>\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope. We have over 8,500 active associates in eleven offices in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Thank you for lending to Eladia and the 'Trabajando Para el Futuro' group!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":491174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She will use the loan to buy fabric and increase her capital.  She is single and has one son, and she lives with relatives in the Pampahasi zone.  Her goal is to have her own small business and to sell at wholesale.\r\n\r\nYolanda, the member who is acting as the bank's treasurer, has been selling fish in the same area for 10 years.  This loan will be used to increase her capital.  She is married to Nestor and has 3 children.  In addition, Yolanda tells us that when she came to EMPRENDER the wall of her house was about to fall, and with the loans she was able to fix her home, for which she is very grateful.  She is one of the representatives of the communal bank, and she was elected to this post because she had demonstrated responsibility as a guarantor and fellow group member.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are very grateful to EMPRENDER and Kiva for the trust provided in granting this loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise: fabric and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Corina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabet Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nadia Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16410.26,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1161.96},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1276.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1297.52},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1318.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1340.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1362.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1384.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1407},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1429.98},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1453.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1477.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1501.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.6},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":194157,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martin is a 34-year-old married man who is blessed with two children, a six-year-old and a two-year-old.

Fuente, en la provincia de Cartago. El principal sistema de drenaje de esta zona es el r\u00edo Reventaz\u00f3n que nace en el Cerro Cueric\u00ed. Por la fertilidad de sus suelos volc\u00e1nicos y aluviales, Cartago es el centro de poblaci\u00f3n que tiene en la agricultura y ganader\u00eda sus principales fuentes econ\u00f3micas.\nDesde hace varios a\u00f1os que Rosibel se dedica a la venta de ropa, comenz\u00f3 como intermediaria con mercader\u00eda ajena y poco a poco ha ido haciendo sus propias prendas. Pero en estos momentos, le falta lo principal para que su negocio surja y para que los vecinos de su comunidad se vean beneficiados.  \nActualmente Rosibel est\u00e1 solicitando un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2600.000 (seiscientos mil colones) para  darle mantenimiento a dicho negocio y comprar m\u00e1s ropa para que haya un incremento, ya que la demanda es grande. Su meta es tener un local en un futuro, donde se pueda instalar bien con sus mercaderia y mejorar tanto su calidad de vida como la de su familia. \n\nRosibel es socia de la Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Fuente Agr\u00edcola, una de las 150 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico adem\u00e1s de participar activamente en la organizaci\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito en su comunidad.\n","en":"Rosibel, 40, lives with her family in La Fuente, in Cartago province.  The main water run-off system in this area is the Reventazon River, which starts up in the Cueric\u00ed mountain.  Because of the fertility of its land, due to its volcanoes and floodplains, Cartago is a town where agriculture and livestock production are the main economic activities.\r\n\r\nRosibel has been selling clothing for a number of years.  She started out as an intermediary selling merchandise from others, and gradually she has been making her own garments.  But at this time, she lacks the money to make her business expand, which would benefit the neighbors in her community.  So Rosibel is requesting a small loan of 600,000 Costa Rican colones to invest in her business and buy more clothing, since the demand is strong.  Her goal is to have a store in the future that she could fill with merchandise. This would allow Rosibel and her family to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRosibel is a member of the \"Fuente Agricola\" communal bank, one of the 150 such organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan, and with it she hopes to continue to grow, both at the personal and economic level.  In addition, she expects to participate actively in the credit organization in her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":981829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
