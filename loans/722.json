Although the structure is made of cement blocks and the floor is tiled, the roof is damaged and needs to be changed.  At this time the dwelling does not have iron gates that could secure the house. She leaves for work very early and returns late at night, leaving the house empty most of the time.  She fears that delinquents will damage the house.  That is why she requests a loan with which she can fix the roof of her house and buy an iron gate for the door of her dwelling.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Dayra es soltera, habita en el asentamiento Memorial Sandino, sector muy pobre, semi rural, existe escasez de agua potable, las calles no est\u00e1n pavimentadas.

She is 30 years old. Melanie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Melanie owns & operates a business venture running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Melanie has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Melanie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melanie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Melanie is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Melanie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In addition, she mentions that she helps her mother to care for her animals.  \"My mother is older, and I like to help her,\" she states.

She worked there for many years but due to her effort and the good use of her earnings, she was able to invest and in this way start her own business. Currently, she has her own sweets stand which has allowed her to support her 3 children in their education as they are currently in school. This is why Guillermina had to work very hard to be able to have her children get ahead since she has made it known to us that she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nIn her fifties, Guillermina feels full of strength to keep working and in this way provide the best she can for her children as they are her motivation to keep making progress.\r\n\r\nGuillermina's biggest wish is to have her children finish their studies. The loan she requested will be used to invest in her business buying cookies, candies, chocolates, amongst other sweets, and in this way add variety to her stand.  \r\n\r\nThe Communal Bank \"Las Positivas\" is a group made up of 7 members of which Guillermina is the president.

Samwel is the facilitator of the Chuma SHG group. These farmers reside in the Chwele district. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Samwel and his group during Kenya's next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund's integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nSamwel takes care of four children at home.

With these loans, she has been able to purchase her products and at the same time cover her modest household expenses. <p>\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nCon una mesita de madera hace 3 a\u00f1os en el mercado la Terminal de Le\u00f3n inici\u00f3 su negocio de venta de agua, gaseosas y jugos la se\u00f1ora Darling L. quien es madre de dos peque\u00f1as ni\u00f1as en la edad escolar.<p>\r\nSus grandes esfuerzos por salir adelante la han llevado a sobresalir en su negocio, desde muy tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana, ella se prepara para comenzar las ventas del d\u00eda yendo hacia su local en las afueras del mercado la Terminal espec\u00edficamente en la estaci\u00f3n de buses.<p>\r\n\r\nHoy en d\u00eda, ha mejorado la situaci\u00f3n de su negocio debido a que ha adquirido una peque\u00f1a refrigeradora donde colocar sus productos, adem\u00e1s ha cambiado su antigua mesa y ha colocado una en mejores condiciones donde poner sus productos.

With that loan, he was able to give the down payment on his vehicle so that he could use it to promote his products and those of other businesses in the city of Nuevo Laredo. He has already repaid his loan and is requesting another one so that he can purchase a higher capacity sound system, thus increasing both his clientele and his income. His children also work in this business. They are all independent, but the family collaborates in sharing the equipment for the business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEl Sr. M. se dedica a la publicidad de otros negocios perifoneando en la ciudad sobre promociones y eventos.

Since many families eat rice and beans as the main component of their meals, she believes selling these products will improve her income.\r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to gradually increase her inventory until she is able to establish a small grocery store.  Martha will continue to buy and sells pigs, but she will also focus on the growth of her store.  With this goal in mind, she wants to provide her young children what they need to obtain an education because everything is expensive.  They attend a public school, but the cost of uniforms, shoes, and school supplies have increased.  For this reason, she needs to increase her sales and improve the infrastructure of her home because the wood is aging and the walls need repairs.  She also wants to tile all the floors so that they will be safer and cleaner for her family.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":525746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase beans, rice, oil, and pigs to butcher","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1416.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640190},{"amount":135,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2833.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561999},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":1400.18,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1417.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770911},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":1399.82,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1416.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204805},{"amount":72.76,"local_amount":1509.16,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1527.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330501},{"amount":67.13,"local_amount":1392.28,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1409.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465659},{"amount":66.59,"local_amount":1381.05,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1397.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097805},{"amount":68.34,"local_amount":1417.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1434.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348428},{"amount":62.68,"local_amount":1300.18,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766106}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T20:43:06Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":197915,"name":"Idayat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Idayat has a hair dressing salon where she makes lovely hair styles for her customers.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":803019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narayani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743322},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1801.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594784},{"amount":50,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3605.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691524},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1801.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647889},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-25T09:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865021},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666.98,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275006},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1801.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416472},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1667.03,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-23T08:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1802.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131273},{"amount":49.89,"local_amount":3325.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-26T08:27:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3597.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947076},{"amount":24.49,"local_amount":1674,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1810.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.62,"payment_id":283296469}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T23:12:27Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":316747,"name":"Ngoc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngoc is a 39-year-old married woman with 2 children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

had many intentions of being in business, year after year selling clothing door-to-door which unfortunately often did not allow her to spend time with her three children.

However she has a goal to attract more customers toward which she is putting all her efforts.  Her constant motivation is her small children who are of school age.  She is a big help with regard to the family\u2019s economic situation, given that her husband\u2019s income often is not enough to cover their living expenses.   One of her goals is to improve her store, all while continuing to work buying merchandise.  It\u2019s for this reason that she seeks a loan so she can purchase products of a greater variety and that will appeal to her customers.

Being patient, creative and artistic gave her the opportunity to dedicate herself to making necklaces and bracelets that she learned how to make when she was single.  Now that she is married she helps her husband by doing this activity.  Every afternoon she goes to her workshop that is located a few blocks from her house, where she designs her necklaces and other accessories.  On the weekends, she goes out to sell and distribute her products at the stores downtown.  Her jewelry has been well-accepted and the ladies of the city visit the stores where her jewelry is sold to find the newest pieces of her collection.  This increases Rocio\u2019s orders.  Now she would like to study and specialize in order to improve her designs and start a store where she can sell her jewelry directly according to the orders her customers make.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has already received two loans. She is married and the mother of 6 children. <P>\r\n\r\nDuring the hot season, Mrs. D. sells ice and juice, something she has been doing since 1982. She also sells, in front of her house or at the school located near her, seasonal fruit for children such as oranges, as well as candy, cookies, and various other items. The evolution of her juice business is really motivating her to expand her enterprise. Thus, she is requesting a loan of 250,000 frs to buy a stock of ingredients that will let her prepare breakfasts. The previous loans that have allowed her to grow her working capital have led to increased income and permitted her to acquire new materials as well as equipping her house, little by little. <br

She lives in the Esperanza de Malambo neighborhood with her 5 year old son that totally depends on her.  Because she has been left without a husband, she has had to take on all the household responsibilities.  \n\nSince her husband got sick she has been distributing dulce de leche (caramel sauce made from milk) and banana and guava preserves.  She obtained a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which she bought some small display cases that she put in various shops.  She stocked them with her exquisite dulce de leche and banana and guava preserves that she repacks herself and displays in these shops. \n\nThis is her second loan.  She will use it to buy 100 boxes of preserves, 100 caramel pots, 200 boxes of gelatin and packaging supplies in order to distribute them.  As always, she will put them in different shops in Malambo.  She transports them with a motorcycle that she bought with the earnings that she saved.  This has helped her business and now she has more income, whereas before she had to spend money to rent one.  \n\nIngris Mar\u00eda heard of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo from her sister-in-law, who recommended them to her, as she is a long standing client of the Fundaci\u00f3n.  \n\nHer husband started this business more than 5 years ago, but has since died after a long illness.  Along with him she has been able to sustain her household and invest money into the business.  It has grown and helped her to increase her income.  It also allowed her to buy the motorcycle with which she can continue to open new markets further from her home.  She also bought a lot where she can build a small house.  \n\nHer biggest challenge is to steadily increase her sales because, during times like the rainy season, sales decrease.  For this reason she has started sending her products to Sabanagrande, Santo Tom\u00e1s and some municipalities in the department of Bol\u00edvar.  This has helped her to gain more than 800 steady customers, facilitate her business and generate new work.  \n\nThe loss of her husband 5 months ago is one of the biggest challenges the she has had to face.  This forced her to assume responsibility for their household.    Now, Ingris dreams of building a house in a good section of town, since currently, she lives in the Esperanza neighborhood where nothing is paved and the main means of transportation is the motocycle taxi.\n\n\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":569423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 100 boxes of preserves, 100 caramel pots,  200 boxes of gelatin y packaging supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-28T01:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingris Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125368},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":131235},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":133422},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":135646},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":137907},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":140205},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":142542},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":144918},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":147333},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149789},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":152285},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159350}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.03},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.21,"local_amount":125368,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127391.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117136},{"amount":71.41,"local_amount":131235,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":133353.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411006},{"amount":72.6,"local_amount":133422,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":135575.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550659},{"amount":73.81,"local_amount":135646,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":137835.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688265},{"amount":75.03,"local_amount":137907,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":140132.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427494},{"amount":76.29,"local_amount":140205,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":142467.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000908},{"amount":77.56,"local_amount":142542,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":144842.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288916},{"amount":78.85,"local_amount":144918,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":147256.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230081},{"amount":331.24,"local_amount":608757,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:05Z","rounded_local_amount":618582.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568959}],"funded_date":"2010-07-28T04:41:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":222510,"name":"Meliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meliza D., from the village of Bal-ason, Gingoog City, is 21 years old, single, and has one infant.

She has been farming almost all her life, but also ventured into the livestock business 16 years ago when she began selling excess milk produced by her cows to a local dairy. Her cows produce 60 liters of milk a day, which generates a lot of income. She also earns revenue from the sale of male calves. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, Eva's children help her with her livestock business and farm. They grow potato and maize, but mostly for the family's consumption. Most of the land is dedicated to the dairy business because it is more profitable.

organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Her sales are carried out in cash or on credit, of which she collects 50% within 45 days.\r\n\r\nHer dreams have mostly materialized in seeing her children become professionals, and work for themselves. Her biggest concern is of her daughter who is differently abled who will be left alone when she passes away.

This activity has made it possible for her to contribute to her family's income and satisfactorily meet the most urgent needs of her two small children. Every item of clothing Adolat produces is superior, and due to this her orders have markedly increased. She has some very large orders that would be impossible to fulfill if she didn't have an assistant. Her incredible energy, fortitude, and commitment to her clients drives her to offer them new and improved service. To this end, Adolat wants to speed up her dress production by purchasing more fabrics. To accomplish her objective, she is asking for a $500 USD loan to buy new modern fabrics and she promises to repay the loan in 12 months. With your help, you can make her dream come true.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

City, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Emmanuel, is a small sugar farmer. They have three young children who are between 4 and 9 years old. The older kids are presently attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nMerlita works hard to help her husband provide for their children\u2019s future because she does not want them to go through the same hardships she had while she was growing: needing to have a paying job just to help her parents support their family. Her most cherished dream is for her children to finish their studies and get a stable job or have an established livelihood.\r\n\r\nMerlita met her husband in Manila many years ago when she worked as a factory worker just to help her parents support their family. When they got married, they decided to go home to Negros where Emmanuel had a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) farmland that he could plant with sugarcane. Merlita had to adjust to living in a new place and she also realized that she needed to have her own source of income so that she could help her husband support their family.\r\n\r\nWhen Merlita gave birth to their oldest child, she decided to put up a general store adjacent to their house. She thought that this would serve two purposes: she could take care of her child and their household while selling basic goods to her neighbors and earn a supplemental income for their family. But in spite of her best efforts, she could not sustain the required inventory level that was needed and she sometimes did not have enough stock to sell. She almost decided to close down her store.\r\n\r\nIt was serendipity that a friend introduced Merlita to NWTF-Project Dungganon, and when she became a member in 2002, she was able to access the much-needed capital to support the capital requirements of her store. She was even able to expand her product offerings.\r\n\r\nAs her business grew, Merlita started selling rice to her neighbors, and also raised pigs in her backyard. Now she earns a minimum of PHP 10,000 per month from her business activities. She is currently saving money for the education of her children and also so that she can buy a motorcycle which they will use as another source of income.\r\n\r\nMerlita\u2019s previous loan of PHP 22,500 was utilized as revolving working capital for her businesses. Having paid that in due course, Merlita is borrowing PHP 25,000 this time around so that she can continue sustaining the capital requirements of her businesses. She hopes that all her efforts will bear fruit in the fulfillment of all her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":433721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She now earns an average monthly income of 8,400 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nDaisy is now borrowing 10,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Daisy aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photo of Daisy was taken after she attended the weekly NWTF-Project Dungganon Center Meeting that all group-based clients must attend. The meetings give each borrower the chance to share ideas with their group, learn new business skills and pay back their weekly installments.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

This business emerged as a result of her divorce.  She had to work to support her two children.  That is how she started selling kebabs at the doorway of her house.  In time she became more well-known, and she started to have more customers. \r\n\r\nIn time her business was growing, she got greater income, and she started building her house.  Now she rents her house and continues selling kebobs and meals.  Dina tells us that everything she obtained was with much work and perseverance.  Her children were her motivation, and her desire to improve was bigger than her problems.  \r\n\r\nThanks to her effort and dedication she managed to improve her income.  Her children are now adults, and both of them have established a business making clothes.  Above all, she tells us that she has a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue growing she has requested a new loan to buy supplies, meat, and condiments.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

is a 31 year old single mom with a four year old daughter who is just about to begin kindergarten.  She lives with her parents and brothers in order to save money.  She was in the third year in school on her way to an accounting degree when she had to drop out due to financial difficulties.  It is one of her dreams to one day go back to school to gain her degree. <p>\r\n\r\nWith nowhere else to turn, she got a job working with her father in a spare auto parts shop.  She didn\u2019t know anything about the business since she was being formally trained in accounting, and the years she worked with him were hard.  <p>\r\n\r\nEventually she picked up the trade and with her skills in numbers and accounting, she became a fine business woman.  She had herself and her daughter to support, and did not want to rely on her parents any longer.  Recently she decided to venture out on her own and begin her own shop in another area of Paraguay.  Both her parents and her brother felt is was a great idea and encouraged her.<p>\r\n\r\nNow it has been close to two years since she began her spare parts store and it has grown quite popular in the area.

She started this business with $100 as beginning capital. In 1995, she bought a stall at the market called Lufungula. With hard work and good management, Matane prospered in her business until 2006. She increased her working capital to $700.<p>\r\n\r\n From 2006 to 2007, her business decreased to $50 because of family difficulties due to rising rent costs and her husband\u2019s long absence in Angola, without any news of his welfare. After this, she joined one of Hope\u2019s groups in February 2007, and she reinforced her business by increasing the inventory. Currently, her working capital is $400 and she makes $100 per month as profit. Her ambition is to open a scrap metal store.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live happily together and have a strong desire to get ahead, and in this respect they help each other. Martha produces bread and a variety of biscuits for a bakery which pays her for her services. She learned this trade by watching how the bakers work, and after a time she wanted to begin to produce on her own. She achieved this with great effort, and also a good memory; she mixed the ingredients and came up with shapes. She developed new styles of shapes of bread that today are displayed in the bakery where the customers are able to choose behind glass panels the most tempting breads that they wish to buy. Martha likes her job, and she obtains good earnings; in addition she has a small field where she grows potatoes. Her oldest daughter who works helps her economically, and the younger one helps with the household chores. The goal of the three is to succeed and to have their own bakery where they can offer the exquisite products that are created by their hardworking mother, who has managed to assume the role of father and mother without fear. This is the second loan that they have received from MFP, and they are committed to be responsible and punctual with every payment. In addition, they are content to work with their communal bank because they can work with enterprising women like themselves. The money that they are hoping to receive will be invested in the purchase of compost, fertilizer and potato seed to plant in large quantities to obtain increased earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for her potato fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T21:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843186},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":401.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734774},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959839},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992684},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717467},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751202},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933755},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672659},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886525}],"funded_date":"2009-11-13T01:14:04Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":156324,"name":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D.

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.    Malia needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nSPBD Social Metrics Scores for this Borrower:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              3 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She had experience in this area because she had helped her mother in a similar business before. \r\n<p>\r\nLiliana buys animals (pigs, fowl), fattens them and then she sells them in Lambayeque's city market or to the traders that occasionally visit her hamlet.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is work that she can easily undertake during the time available to her; she also helps her mother with the household chores, because her father works all day as a driver. \n \nLittle by little, Xiomara has learned the secrets of selling, and she currently does it with great enthusiasm, since she truly enjoys advising her friends in the area and other neighbors who are interested in her products in order to improve their image. \n\nHer desire for the future is to continue making progress with her business until she can open her own bazaar, where her products will be more effectively displayed and she can earn a better income. \n\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is committed to making all her payments in a very responsible manner.

She would like to be able to set up a restaurant in her home as she knows that this would make her more profits.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Esther requested a loan from Edaprospo so that she could continue investing in her food business, buying rice, sugar and mixed vegetables in larger quantities as this works out cheaper.  The 'El Progreso del Vallecito' community bank is a group of responsible people who are grateful for the loan that they are being given.
