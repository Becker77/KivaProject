of Ngh\u1ec7 An. In 2003 she contracted a loan of 200 USD. She used this money to buy a calf. After 4 months, she sold the calf for 250 USD. The profit from selling the calf was a big motivation factor for her to continue. She contracted another loan after that to start businesses of pig raising  and liquor making. The liquor making business brings in 2.5 USD daily. With this revenue, Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t repaid the loan and the daily expenses. The waste from her liquor making is used to feed her pigs, this helps cut the cost of pig food. Running both businesses in parallel is quite convenient, it helps reduce considerably the time it takes raising the pigs. Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t is requesting a loan of 325 USD. With this loan she would buy 8 breeding pigs and a peep of egg laying chickens. Selling the eggs would bring in enough revenue to pay her weekly expenses. For the pigs she hopes to sell them in the new year, this would bring in 500 USD. \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nN\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ea1t s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 5 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con t\u1ea1i Nghi L\u1ed9c, Ngh\u1ec7 An.

Despite having two businesses, her daily income is not enough to make her business grow. \r\n\r\n<p><p>\r\nHence, Tessia is requesting a loan amounting to PHP7, 000.00 for additional capital. She would like to purchase products for her manicurist and beautician business, such as hot oils for her customer\u2019s hair and hair relaxing chemicals.  With the loan she will be able to increase the services offered to her customers and increase business, helping her provide for her children\u2019s

loans purposely for business expansion and making good profits.  Hochi is 53 years old, and she is a mother of four adult children.  Her husband works at a pressure station and earns a minimum income of only 270 somoni or 55 dollars per month, and this is why the business brings in an additional income for the family.  The family has an average living minimum.  Hochi's youngest daughter, Nigora, helps her with the business.  Hochi's place of business is located among the rows of women's purses sales at the central Panshanbe market.

She begins her workday early each day at 5:00 a.m., and she buys fruits and vegetables from local farmers and thereafter sells such produce in the market.

people who plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Sok S. has been selected by the members as the village bank president. She is 47 years old, and the mother of two children who attend the local school. She is a farmer who owns a one hectare rice field. She faces a small problem in her plantation, because her field is now infertile. In order to solve this problem, Mrs. Sok S. is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers in order to make her field and crops more productive. Her husband, Mr. Taing Than, is a teacher who earns roughly $50 per month, but this is not enough income to support their family. \r\n\r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Four members have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. This type of loan allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term; but most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a 0% default rate on Kiva loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":207089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers in order to make her rice field and crops more productive.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":237945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To renovate her office","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rhoida S.

For the last three years he has been a part-owner of a restaurant that specializes in roast chicken, also working in the restaurant with his sister.  He is responsible for roasting the chickens and frying the potatoes while she waits on the customers.  Jorge is very satisfied with this work because the business is independent and stable.  He also really likes to see his customers enjoy the golden chicken and crispy potatoes that he makes.  The business is very profitable, since this kind of chicken restaurant is very popular in any neighborhood in his town.  Jorge's dream for the future is to own his own chicken restaurant, where all of the profits will go to him and his family.  This is his fifth loan with MFP.  What he enjoys about working with his community bank is that everyone is very united and responsible with their payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 48-year-old widow who supports her family by operating a grocery store and buying and selling herbal medicines. She lives in the municipality Sta. Fe, Cebu. Florenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.  Florenia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \n\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

But, she does not have enough money to purchase rice seeds so she is asking for a loA. so that she cA. continue cultivating rice. With the remainder of her money, Mrs. S. K. would purchase fertilizer to help the production of her crop. Her husband, Mr. Suk Sam, is a construction worker who makes around $1.50 per day. With this small income, it is very hard to meet the needs for their family\u2019s expenses. Mrs. S. K. is 40 years old and the mother of four children, three of whom are attending the local school while the youngest one, age 3, is still too young to work or study. Mrs. Yoen S. represents her husband who is not in the picture but is applying for a loA.. \r\n<P>\r\nThis is a village bank loA. consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Eleven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loA. until the very end of the loA. term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loA. term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Maura has a business selling fruits and vegetables that is located in the Central Market, which is one of the biggest markets in the city of San Salvador.  This market has an abundance of customers, since goods here are sold at lower prices than in other markets.  Maura requests a loan through which she will buy a large quantity of fruits and vegetables.  For her this loan is very important, because Maura buys all of her products with cash, and since she has daily sales she does not have the economic capacity to be able to restock her

41 years old, works as a grocer. Since 1994, he has owned a small grocery store in the area of Bint Jbeil. The store earns a living for him, his wife, and his three children. Hatem sells food products in his store, including soft drinks, water, canned products, vegetables and fruits, as well as toys and gifts. Due the region\u2019s difficult economic conditions, Hatem also works as driver, transporting students and to and from their schools during the academic year. His good reputation in the area is the main reason behind his success, as he has all the qualities that motivate parents to use his services in transporting their children. Hatem had previously dealt with Al Majmoua, and was well able to repay his loan. He is now coming forward with a request for another loan to purchase a car that will help him earn additional income. The loan will also help him pay school expenses and purchase new school stationery for his children. His diligence is the secret to his success. Hatem aims to grow in the future by owning a transportation network that services students, or through expanding in the grocery and wholesale food products field.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Peter will ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing. In 2012, the members of Sheywe Farmers group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.

She lived the greater part of her childhood with her mother and attended school at the Chiango Educational Center. In her free time, she would help her mother chop wood for resale. In 1990, she married and moved to the Costa do Sol neighborhood, later migrating to Filipe, Matutuine district. Together with her husband she entered the retail business and also performed some agricultural work. Due to difficulties with her children\u2019s schooling, she decided to move to Catembe where she currently lives. \r\n<p>\r\nShe operates her retail business from her backyard and has been active for 20 years. Her husband is trained in business administration. They have no employees as they are able to run the business themselves without assistance. With the current loan of 20,000 MT she plans to purchase rice, sugar and corn starch in 50 and 25 kg bags, respectively, as well as other grocery products. The store's opening hours are from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. She purchases goods in Maputo and rents a car to transport them. The business does not enjoy any peak periods; however, during weekends demand is higher. Her daily revenue is 3,000 MT. The most lucrative products are rice, sugar and oil. She keeps a log where she records receipts and sales as well existing stock. Her main constraint is the lack of transportation and conventional installations. \r\n<p>\r\nHer monthly profit margin is 12,000 MT, which she uses to support the family, improve the shop and put her kids through school. In the future, she plans to build a conventional store, own a form of transportation and if possible set up a hardware store. This may require an additional loan once the current one has been repaid. The client is very happy with the loan as it has helped her increase her sales volume and diversify her product range.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Leo Duran, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shirendev has an underground well in his soum (county) and provides 50% of the soum residents with clean water. Shirendev started his business in 2002 and since then has continually earned more customers because his well is known for its pure, clean water.

bank \"Artesanas de Narancay\" is located in the city of Cuenca in the parish of Ba\u00f1os, which is know for its hot springs, protected forests, and unique natural landscapes that are considered tourist attractions. <p>\r\nThe members of the bank are strong willed women who are not held-back despite the difficulties that face them day to day. Together with their families, they move forward victoriously and are always ready to give us a smile and share their stories. <p>\r\nZara has been a member of this bank for just one lending cycle. She lives in the community of the same name as her community bank together with her husband who works as a security guard. Together they have had six children who vary in age from 34 to 16. Two of these children are already married and live independently, the other single children work and help with the household expenses. Thanks to the family help they have been able to  lay the foundations for their own home. <p>\r\nZara is 55 years old and she works growing corn, lettuce, carrots, onions, etc. She has been doing this for some years and was taught by her mother. She sells all her products in the Cuenca market. With the loan she receives from the Foundation she will buy corn seed and seedlings of lettuce, carrots, onions, etc, and she will use part to buy books for her youngest son who is still in school. <p>\r\nHer greatest dream is that her children will stand out in their professional and family lives. <p>\r\nJust like Zara, Maura has been working with the community bank for one loan cycle. She is a very cheerful member and she told us that her sister-in-law invited her to be part of this great group and access the benefits offered by the Foundation. Our friend is 32 years old, an affectionate wife, and the mother of kids of 10 and 8 years old. She carries out various economic activities including selling cosmetics from the Yanbal catalog (which she has been doing for 3 years), also washing clothes for her neighbors (for two years), and, of course, caring for her home and her children. <p>\r\nMaura tells us that her husband moved abroad six years ago in search of better opportunities for him and his family, but that it hasn't been easy. They still do not have their own home and they live in her sister's house. With the money from her loan she will buy creams, perfumes, lipsticks, and makeup, along with other products from the Yanbal line. Her goal is to continue growing her business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":490652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy corn seed, seedlings of lettuce, onion, and carrot; also creams, makeup, perfumes, eyeshadow, lipsticks, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zara Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fanni Eustela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1705,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":213.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":213.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":282.53,"local_amount":279.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":282.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910760},{"amount":364.36,"local_amount":360.14,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":364.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946445},{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":213.13,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":215.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946446},{"amount":862.48,"local_amount":852.48,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":862.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708893}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T05:49:26Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":182350,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LA Sra.

Do\u00f1a Lucrecia has 2 sons; her eldest son is 18 and is in his first year of college and her youngest son is 15 and in the 4th year of secondary school.  Her goal is to maintain her source of income so that her sons may continue their studies.  Her wish is to make improvements to her home so they can enjoy proper living conditions, as well as live there with their own families so the house can be handed down to future generations.

Do\u00f1a Lucrecia began her business out of need, since she did not have a job, her domestic partner had stopped working, and they did not have any income.  Her children were young and she would not allow them to go hungry for lack of daily bread, so Do\u00f1a Lucrecia filled with courage and decided to start this business that, to this day, has done so well.  Despite having no help from her husband, Do\u00f1a Lucrecia feels herself to be an independent person, capable of maintaining her home.

He has worked in the family business alongside his parents since he was 16 years old, buying up raw wool fleece. He is currently still doing this, but now does it on his own, thereby helping out with the family expenses. Paulo buys raw wool from local sheep farmers and later takes it to other cities such as Cuzco and Tacna to be sold. He has been in business for 2 years and what he likes most about it is that he can continue the family tradition. He hopes that in the future his business grows and he can collect even more wool fleece to sell in other places.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The leader of the group, Raikul is forty six years old. An unsuccessful marriage and subsequent divorce did not shake her belief in life and happiness. She has raised her children on her own and her two sons have grown up and become mature. They received all her love and have absorbed all her efforts to inspire in them family values. Now the eldest son always helps his mother. He works in a brick factory. The little son, 18, has gone to serve in the army.\r\n\r\nAs to Raikul, she is engaged in animal husbandry and cattle breeding. Some years ago she bought a calf from her sister and that is how she got involved in this business. She quickly grasped the aspects of this occupation and her earnings have allowed her to pay for her eye treatment and buy better food for home. She has lots of plans about making repairs to her house and building a convenient shed, but before that, she wants to get a loan to buy a milk cow. Selling milk would bring in more money for the family budget. \r\n\r\nRaikul has three partners: Kyialbek, Nurgulya and Jumakan:\r\n\r\nKyialbek, 33, raises livestock. Kolkhoz gave him a cow instead of a salary and Kyialbek managed to increase the total population and improve his living standards. He hopes to obtain a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nNurgulya, 24, is a housewife with two children. Besides that, she keeps some cattle and sells milk. The earnings from what she does have tremendously helped her husband buy a house. Nurgulya feels inspired to buy one more cow to increase her income. However, she needs a loan to do that.\r\n\r\nJumakan, 49, is the mother of four children. Together with her husband they raise cattle and thus provide for themselves, as their children are grown-ups and live separately. Jumakan wants to buy a cow. This loan would enable her to make this purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Mombasa is in the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the white beaches of the Indian Ocean. She has been selling electrical goods for the last ten years, including sockets, phone cases, batteries, air conditioners and others, to the local people and to other retailers. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is financial constraints. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. \r\n\r\nShe is using her loan of 80,000 KES to buy more stocks of electrical goods to expand her business and meet the demands of her customers. She hopes to be a wholesaler in the future. She describes herself as honest, open minded and

Romeo is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Romeo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has five children ages 20, 18, 15, 9, and 5. She has one additional dependent who lives with her because he is a relative of her husband. In 2006, Kadiatu established her local foodstuff business. She began her business because she wants to assist her husband in providing support to the family. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about 1,600,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of 4,500,000 leones. Kadiatu has already received and successfully repaid her first loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy garri, bulgar, beans, and groundnuts for her business.
