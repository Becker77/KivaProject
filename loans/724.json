She earns her living by operating three business ventures: she runs a general store; she also buys un-milled rice from farmers and after drying the grains, sends it to the rice mill for processing and sells the polished rice; and she raises and fattens pigs in her backyard. \r\n\r\nHer husband Ignacio S., who is 36 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between the ages of 2 and 11 years old. One of the children has work, three are in school and the youngest is still at home.\r\n\r\nMercy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mercy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 17,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $140, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to add to her own working capital to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and for business expansion. Mercy S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

The members came up with the name because that is how long they want the group to last:  forever.  This story is about Emma G. H., given she is the representative of this group.  She is 50 years old, and a widow with two children:  Maria del Carmen, 22, and Genaro, who is 21.  Both are in school; the oldest is in her second year of a Political Science degree, and the other is in his first year of studying for a teaching degree.  \r\n\r\nEmma dedicates herself to making and selling bread.  She decided on this business because she says there is a lot of demand, and it generates a good income.  In addition, she wanted to find a way to improve her and her family\u2019s standard of living and to provide her children with an education.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the loan into purchasing more ingredients such as: sugar, lard, flour, yeast and eggs, so she can increase production, offer a greater variety of products and to increase her sales.  She says that things are going very well with the business, so much so that she is putting aside some of her income to finish building the kitchen in her house and to continue supporting her children with their educations so they can embark on professional careers.  She also continues to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nShe comments that her business is benefiting her neighbors a great deal, since there are not many people who do what she does nearby.  Since she is close, they all buy from her.  In addition, she provides excellent attention and services to her customers and offers her products at a good price.\r\n\r\nEmma\u2019s dream is to build a larger locale in her own house, so she can expand her business.  She would like to open a bakery that she would have much better stocked so she could increase her earnings and pay for her children\u2019s advanced degrees.  She tells us that the members of the group are very responsible and punctual with their loan payments, since they have gotten to know each other, get along well, and are from the same community.  For these reasons, they have never fallen behind or defaulted on their payments, as they don\u2019t want to risk the trust that has been placed in them.  She is very thankful to the Foundation and to Kiva for the support of the loan granted to her since, thanks to this, her business is improving a great deal and it has changed their lives.  \r\n\r\nThe members of \u201cForever\u201d, and the activities they carry out, are as follows:\r\n\r\nEmma G.

However, during the post-harvest process many are suffering financially as they have to wait for the buyers to pay them. The agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

Both the junior and senior secondary schools have 44 dedicated staff members.\n\nThis secondary school remains the first school of choice for girls in Makeni city and even beyond. The students of this school continue to make good grades in both the Basic Education Examination\u2019s Certificate (BECE) for the Junior Secondary School and the West Africa Senior Secondary Schools Examination (WASSE). The school has contributed immensely towards the education of girls in Makeni and beyond. Many of the city\u2019s educated women came from this school. This Secondary School also continues to triumph over other schools in terms of sports (such as volleyball and other athletics).\n\nAugustine I. T.

He is 65 years old, married, and has 12 children, seven of whom are still attending school. Mr. Augustine will invest the loan into business. He has been in business for many years now.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and  kitchenware businesses. Her husband, Fabiano M., who is 48 years old, works as a kitchenware salesman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's other business activities.  They have six children who are 11  to  23 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her hog raising and kitchenware businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future for family and education. Teresita M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

As for her sons, her oldest son works at a catering business (and she notes that he has been in this business for the past 8 years), while her youngest son is a student in the 8th standard. Shakeela baji\u2019s husband has a (chicken) meat-selling business. <p>\r\n\r\nAs alluded to above, Shakeela baji herself has a decorative, embroidery business. Specifically, she takes orders for embroidered dresses from her customers, and she then makes such dresses to earn a profit. Notably, she has already successfully repaid two prior loans from Asasah, a microfinance institute of Pakistan. Now she is applying for another loan to buy materials (e.g., utensils, chairs, and table clothes) to help expand her son\u2019s catering business. <p>\r\n\r\nShakeela baji is joined in her loan group by four other members: Fazilat baji seeks a loan to buy materials (e.g., colored threads, beads, clothes, and sketches) to display in her boutique; Shamim baji requests a loan to buy materials (e.g., colored threads and clothes) for her decorative, embroidery business; Wakeelan baji would like a loan to buy engine oil to resell; and Fatima baji is in need of a loan to buy colors for her tie-die business. This is a group loan; as such, the loan proceeds will be distributed amongst the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. Notably, the group members mutually guarantee one another's loans; as a result, if one group member does not repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":252641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by increasing her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":83687.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436357},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83687.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130629},{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":83687.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027426},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83687.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613427},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":83687.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010507},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":83687.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232803}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T20:54:17Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":86994,"name":"Amalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amalia B., 42 years old, is married and lives at San Pedro, Dapitan City.

She is very thankful to PMPC for the programs and services that help her a lot. She is now on her 7th loan amounting to  PHP 14,500.00 to be used as additional capital of  her sari-sari store.  She will purchase additional grocery items such as canned goods, rice, condiments and many others. She plans to expand her business to become a mini grocery someday. \r\n\r\nHer greatest ambition in life is be able to let her son finish college and have a decent home for the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":276276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":288209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her status is that she is in a polygamous marriage, though she lives alone with her husband and her children in the Sogomougou district of Koutiala prefecture (Sikasso region).  For societal reasons, she did not attend school.  She soon got interested in working to earn an income, notably in fattening livestock, a trade she learned from her mother.  She has been in this business for eight years now, and it is very profitable.  She can sell over fifteen heads of livestock each month for just foreign customers. \r\n<p>\r\nTo do right by her customers and to increase her sales figures, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.  After eight solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid without difficulty, she is on her second individual loan.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Liney has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Liney is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her fourth loan from PMPC.

Now, she wants to invest in more machines since sometimes she is full and there aren't any available machines for other customers who come and have to wait a long time to be able to play.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":426333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"To buy video arcade machines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Choluteca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.333333 -87.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T22:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753127},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142181},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979575},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010584},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734949},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768407},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152085868},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1692.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799736},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":3333.34,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172818},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":3333.3,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177468890}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T11:53:25Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":156827,"name":"Farida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located in the community of Barrio Santiago, Acteopan, in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The group is made up of 5 members who know each other because they are neighbours. This is their first loan with Fundacion Realidad. \r\n     \r\nThe representative of the group is Miss Pompilia T. A., age 37, who studied until the 6th grade and obtained her primary certificate. She is single and has no children. She is a potter and needs a loan to purchase clay, firewood, lead, celite, and paint for decorating her pans, pots and jars of various sizes and models. From a very young age she has enjoyed helping her father with this work, and he taught her how to work with clay. She has been in this business for 15 years and her father, mother and brother are involved in the making of the products. Some will cut the clay, others will crush it and others put on the plaster, handles and edges of the pans, pots and jars. She considers her business to be important because it generates the  income for her household costs, food and savings to continue purchasing materials. This is a family business; generations of her family have worked in pottery. She takes great satisfaction in seeing her completed pans, pots and jars because they are very beautiful; and she gets great satisfaction when her customers say that they are beautiful. They bring their products to sell in the Ozumba plaza on Tuesdays, and also in Tonatico, in the state of Mexico. They have much competition since these are locations where much pottery is offered for sale. The good thing is that Pompilia already has customers who only buy from her because of her quality, good price and good service. Her earnings are used to purchase more clay and firewood, and she saves to cover her household costs.\r\n      \r\nBarrio Santiago, Acteopan, in the state of Puebla is a very beautiful village. There are trees and fields, and they sow sorghum, corn, and peanuts and use donkeys, horses and mules to work in the fields. They use yoked oxen to plough the land. There are paved roads, some with cobblestone and some cement. They have a festival in the neighbourhood of Santiago on July 25th where they celebrate mass, have a procession, and set off fireworks. There is dancing, the Chinelos [a traditional Mexican dance] and food for all who go to the Santiago neighbourhood party.\r\n      \r\n Pompilia and her family dream and hope to purchase a truck to transport the clay, firewood and their merchandise for sale to Tonatico in the state of Mexico. \r\n       \r\n The group members are: Fidelia M. P., who will use her loan to purchase clay, lead, celite and paint to make her pots and pans; Mrs Jaime T. M., who will purchase clay and ceramic to make her rustic flowerpots; Mrs Gregoria Montano H., who will purchase lead, firewood, clay etc for the making of her pans; Pompilia T. A., who will purchase clay, lead, firewood, celite and paint to make her pans, pots and jars; and Mrs Virginia B., who will purchase clay to make her pans.\r\n       \r\nThe group members want to tell Kiva and Fundacion Realidad \"thank you for your confidence in us, and we will repay the loan so that you will lend to us again\".<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":575887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"the purchase of clay, firewood, lead, celite and paint for making pots, pans and jars","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Barrio Santiago, Acteopan, estado de Puebla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fidelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pompilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854277},{"amount":318.75,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4042.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121174},{"amount":159.38,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415275},{"amount":159.37,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415276},{"amount":159.38,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415277},{"amount":114.79,"local_amount":1440.56,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1456.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554929},{"amount":15.94,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":202.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430866},{"amount":7.97,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":101.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850182},{"amount":7.97,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":101.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233894},{"amount":12.7,"local_amount":159.44,"processed_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":161.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785303}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T23:29:23Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":223042,"name":"Gertrudes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Gertrudes T., 60, a resident of Silang, Cavite, Philippines.

Kenya. Ugu village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from ka-David well. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that David and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nDavid works as a subsistence farmer, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. David and three other promoters in his community, including Noah, Kenedy and Joseph, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. David will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. David wants to be a promoter because he believes that the chlorine will kill germs in water making it safe for use.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that David\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noah ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenedy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":970,"name":"Joan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\r\nJoan is 33 years old, married and has two children.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Maria\u2019s daughter was two years old and ready to start daycare, Maria decided to start her own day care center in order to provide a high-quality learning environment for her daughter, as well as other children in her community.  She started \u201cKids Place 2 Explore and Learn\u201d two years ago and since then has transformed her home into a learning facility for six children from two to five years old.\r\n\r\nWhen she started her daycare, Maria had trouble getting a small business loan from a bank. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see my home daycare as a business, and I needed a very small amount of money,\u201d she says.  She is grateful for a loan from Opportunity Fund and Kiva, which will allow her to purchase what she needs for her facility without the stress of high interest rate credit cards, the only other source of financing available to her. \r\n\r\nMaria needs a loan to purchase cubbies and bookshelves, portable cribs, educational toys and books, and new flooring. These supplies are essential to Maria\u2019s business to keep her enrollment up, since parents look for the quality of materials, furniture, and toys when selecting a daycare.  \r\n\r\nMaria is proud of the success of her business and that her enrollment is at capacity for the space she has. She is happy when the children, at first reluctant to leave their parents, begin to see her home as an enjoyable place to spend the day. In the future, Maria would like to move her daycare from her home to an off-site location where she would have the capacity to grow.

Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His only daughter is a student at the State Arts School of Ulaanbaatar. Lhagvasuren's family moved to the capital city from the countryside in 2000. In the beginning, he did not know what to do, but he eventually rented someone's car and drove it as a taxi in the city. Later, he bought a car for himself with the profits he earned and drives his own car as a taxi now. Since he is good at repairing old cars, he usually purchases broken cars and fixes them up to sell them at a higher price. It gives him a chance to earn extra income besides his main taxi business. In the future, he dreams of having his own car repair shop where he would be able to do what he is best at and fix many types of small cars. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRight now he is requesting a loan to fix his

She customizes these garments according to the style or design that is requested by the customer, thereby ensuring the sale without risk of excess inventory.

She earns her living by operating a sari sari (general) store.  Her husband Edcor, who is 40 years old, works as a government utility employee to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 8 years old. Cecelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000 thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future for her children's education. Cecelia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

At the same time, he will be able to offer his clients better service, with better quality and flexibility, which should be reflected in an increase in sales and income. He will be able to continue to safeguard and improve the well-being and quality of life of his family, and to give a better education to his child.

One of their daughters died of pneumonia.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more khanga in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T07:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace J.

She is 51 years old.  She attended school until the 3rd grade in the colonial era and stopped attending due to financial considerations.  She is married and has 4 adult children who have their own homes.  She lives in the Boane district in the Marconi neighborhood with her husband and 3 grandchildren, whom she supports.  \r\n\r\nMatilde grew up with her parents and later moved with them to Manhica where she later married.  Due to the 16 year war, which was very intense in this region, she left for Boane in 1985 to find a safer place to live.\r\n\r\nDuring this same timeframe, she learned to do activities that could generate income, while her husband worked in one of the Boane quarries (this area has around 4 quarries where stones are extracted for construction of homes and roads).\r\n\r\nMatilde owns her own business.  She sells a variety of items to meet basic needs (soap, toothpaste, beer, soft drinks) that she acquires in Maputo.  She earns around 500,000MT per month and is able to save some money in a commercial Bank.\r\n\r\nShe has had loans in the past with an association that used group loan methodology, through which she took out and successfully paid off loans of 1.500,00 MT; 2.000,00 MT and 3.000,00 MT.  This loan with Hluvuku-Adsema will be her fourth, with a value of 23.500,00 MT that she will used to expand her business (by selling fish).  She wants to start selling fish because the products she currently sells have not had much demand.\r\n\r\nShe learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through neighbors who had taken out loans for 16.00,00 MT; 22.000,00 MT and 23.000,00 MT, respectively, for similar activities (selling basic goods). \r\n\r\nShe plans to pay off the loan to have access to future loans with the goal of growing her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

Pardaboy is a very loving father who is devoted to the needs of his grandchildren, whom he adores. Pardaboy is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example. \r\n\r\nHe works raising livestock and every morning leaves home to take his animals to pasture in the surrounding area. His desire is to improve the quality of his animals but in order to do this he must purchase livestock of better breeds, and these animals are very costly. He needs working capital of $800 USD, and at the moment he does not have that much money and he is requesting this loan. Pardaboy hopes that you trust in his hard work and honesty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is comprised of ten members.  There are nine women and one man.  All of the members are completing a cycle in which they are demonstrating excellent performance.  They are very united, responsible, and supportive members.  Some of them decided to rest, and others want to continue.  To do this they invited new members.\r\n\r\nLoreto sells food in a boarding house in her home.  Her husband helps her serve the dishes that she cooks.  The boarding house supports the pair and their two children.  The loan is to buy tables, chairs, and supplies to increase their sales and improve the income from the business.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group sells chickens, grilled food, bread, fast food, or cosmetics.  Some work in hair salons or provide veterinary services.  There is a lot of competition within the areas that they work.  But, thanks to their experience and the quality of their products, the members know how to get ahead.

She is standing on the far left and raising her hand in the photo. She is 42, married and the mother of seven children who are presently attending school. Her husband is the doorman at the residence of a Baptist church pastor at the Africa Center (CBCA). \r\n\r\nKavugho B. sells used clothing at the central market of Virunga. To increase her income, Mrs. Kavugho B.  also makes tablecloths and sells cooking sets. She has been selling used clothing for 8 years. She began her business with her own funds, which she had received from her brother-in-law, and also with money earned selling small items for her neighbor. Her initial working capital amounted to US$ 10. \r\n\r\nWith the MFI Hekima loan, she is intending to buy one bale of used shirts and 1\/2 bale of used pants. Her greatest challenge is that sometimes in a bale of used clothing, she finds items that are completely worn out and sometimes torn. In a bale of used clothing, there are sometimes useless items that no one will buy. This constitutes a loss for her. \r\n\r\nMrs. Kavugho B. hopes to manage to get a container of bales of used clothing and become a wholesaler in her town. This would be possible with a loan of US$ 5000 which she hopes to obtain one of these days. As for her family, she intends to raise her children so as to see them finish their studies under the best possible conditions. \r\n\r\nMrs. Kavugho B. thanks Hekima for the continued loans that she receives without any collateral, for it is due to these loans that she is able to support herself and her children. \r\n\r\nThis Faida group consists of 22 members. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":543825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"1 bale of used shirts and 1\/2 bale of used pants, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Her two older children are from her first relationship and they now live independently.  Her youngest son is from her current relationship.\r\n\r\nFor three years, she has dedicated the greater part of her day to agricultural work, which she and her partner perform on the lands she owns.  All of her sacrifices are rewarded when she sells her products, which are all native to the zone (coffee, citrus fruits, and bananas).  During harvest time, she gets help from her sons, who she pays 20 soles per day.\r\n\r\nDelia's favorite part of her job is weeding her lands so that each fruit can develop freely.  However, it is uncomfortable for her to transport the crops to her house to box them and to ship them to the markets in the city.  As her work is profitable, she would like to acquire more land and to plant more fruits.  She would also like to set up a small grocery store in her house.  She plans to finish building this soon.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that she has taken out a loan through Microfinanzas Prisma.  Since she is familiar with how her communal bank works, she is happy to continue working with this group, whose members are very responsible and united.  Delia plans to invest part of the money she's requesting to buy three bags of fertilizer, and with the rest, she will buy tens of bricks that will allow her to finish constructing her house.<br

This time, Volodya is applying for a loan to construct arched greenhouses, because his current greenhouses are not very stable. Since his first loan, his second son has returned from the army, has found a job, and is helping the family.

The other two women will invest in buying pigs; two pigs each, and food to fatten them for 3 months and then resell them at the market at almost twice the initial price.<P>\r\nThese women dream of buying land to expand or build their houses for their sons and daughters. They would also like to have successful businesses to ensure that their children can go to school, and why not, maybe college. These women stopped thinking about their needs a along time ago. They started their families at a very young age and they are devoted to the wellbeing and future of their children, which is a very special quality.

This is 30-year-old Bitris B. from Kyela. She is married with three children between the ages of one and 13. Bitris has been running a used clothing business since 2005. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. \r\n<P>\r\nThese clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. Although there are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n<P>\r\nBitris works at her business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Bitris  currently earns about 220 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more used clothes and cocoa in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business by adding more clothes for reselling. Bitris thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The children are now independent.  She previously worked selling fruit in the Central Market.

She offers urban transportation services in her \u201cmotocarro\u201d  (three wheeled motorized vehicle). Her husband drives it through different parts of the city.  She started with her first loan from Manuela Ramos.  Little by little, she was saving.  With this money she was buying replacement parts to improve the service to the inhabitants of the community.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 2,000 PEN she will buy replacement parts and oils such as lubricants, circuit boxes, and spark plugs.  This way she will offer better service and take much better care of the customers.  Today she is an independent woman.  She and her husband are the ones who make the decisions and administer her business.\r\n\r\nGulnara tells us that belonging to a group of women has helped her to better know her rights.  Together they make sure these are respected.
