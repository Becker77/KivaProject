It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has three children, but only her 13 year old son lives with her.  Her other two children are a 20 year old woman and a 23 year old man.  They have their own independent lives.\n\nApproximately eight years ago she suffered through a divorce.  She had to support her three children alone.  That is why she learned the hairdressing and beautician profession.  She now has her beauty station in her own locale. \n\nShe is proud of her effort because she has known how to get her children ahead, and she loves her work.  Her son that no longer lives with her works selling seafood.  He visits her all of the time, and he helps her with some activities in her business.\n\nHer big goal is to buy a new car in order to move around easier and to be able to share more time with her children.  She requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in order to improve her business.   She will buy new furnishing in order to attract more customers. That way she will achieve the goal that she longs for.\n\nWith determination this woman has known how to overcome obstacles.  She now very happily tells us that her sacrifices have born fruit.  She practices her profession with great joy, and she is close to her children.  Now, the next step is to improve her quality of life.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Enos will educate his children, build a house and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mwambuli Women group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.

She is married to Thierry AGOSSA, a welder, and is the mother of five children, four of whom are in school.  Currently a retailer of pagnes (colorful West African cloth) and shoes, she has embraced numerous kinds of work in the past.  A hairdresser by profession, she had gotten started very early on selling rice door-to-door.  In December 2006, she came to sign her first loan contract for the amount of 40,000 francs CFA in order to bolster her capital.  With this loan, she realized sufficient savings.  With a plan for commerce in beauty products and, little by little, pagnes purchased at the Dantokpa marketplace, she requested as her third loan the amount of 50,000 francs.  Thanks to her distribution method, she has so far procured many customers and a good foundation in the domain of selling pagnes.  She nows wants to sign her fifth loan contract and is asking for the amount of 120,000 francs.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":205240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy lengths of pagnes, pairs of shoe, and boxes of soap and detergent ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T16:40:53Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5284579},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T10:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9897500},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821440},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357703},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046756},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938378},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396066},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52903937},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63125944},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549431}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T18:01:36Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T10:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":70302,"name":"Iv\u00e1n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Ivan tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en el barrio Medardo Andino del municipio de Ticuantepe, es casado y le tienen dos hijos que son menores de edad, su esposa es ama de casa.

Every day he tends to his fields. In the case of corn, he dries it and later threshes it, puts it in sacks and stores it for future sales. The process for planting his fields is first to prepare them with organic fertilizer, plow and sow them, and afterwards irrigate and apply fertilizer and insecticides, if necessary. All this is to insure a good harvest.<p>\r\n\r\nAhror has a friendly family who always tries to help others. In the picture you can see Ahror\u2019s son who also helps him with his business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Wilmer lives with his mom, who has a small grocery store that Wilmer wants to supply with part of the credit he is requesting.  He will also buy more clothing to sell.  His clients are his neighbors and people who travel in the area.  They know him and admire him a lot since he has a physical shortcoming (a spinal deformation).  He doesn't stop working, and his dream is to grow and increase his profits.  He invests $417 and sells $767 every month, which means he has a monthly profit of $350.  Wilmer is very happy and is very friendly.  It was very pleasant to spend the afternoon with him.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":415617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T00:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863406},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":866.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753100},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1732.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142154},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010555},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734922},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2598.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768381},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799719},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904907},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172807}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T15:02:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":152376,"name":"Cristina Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la se\u00f1ora Cristina Isabel S.

He is 31 years old and lives in his parents' home in San Pablo neighborhood.  He is the oldest of three siblings.\r\n\r\nFabio tells us that he has worked for a long time for other companies who make garments and embroideries.  However, over time and bearing in mind the knowledge which he had acquired as regards the production process, working machines and serving customers, Fabio decided to set up his own small business.  Helped by family members who provided him with space in their homes, he was able to set up an office and a workshop.  He acquired his first machine for making embroideries which was originally enough to cover the first jobs that he carried out in his own business.\r\n\r\nHowever, for some years he couldn't manage with the orders which he had and so, through a lot of hard work, he acquired a new, more sophisticated machine which was able to produce 10 embroidery designs in 10 minutes.  In this way he is currently able to satisfy his customers who work for a number of well-known companies.\r\n\r\nFabio loves creating his own embroidery designs since it allows him to offer a range of

goats, cows and horses. Kyrgyz people are proud of their horsemanship. It is often said that Kyrgyz boys learn to ride before they can walk. Cattle and other animals have played a tremendous role in Kyrgyz culture and history since nomadic times.\r\n  \r\nAnarkul A., 54, is the leader of this group. A proud mother of five children, she values animals like her own family. Her mother taught her to have a tender attitude towards animals so that they, in turn, can feel and reward you with help in hard times. \r\n\r\n<p>Anarkul's husband coaches in a local sports school and devotes his entire free time to helping Anarkul feed the cattle and take them to a cattle yard. Their children are no longer financially dependent on Anarkul and her husband. The reselling of cattle allows the couple to cover their daily expenses and improve home comforts. The idea originated two years ago, thanks to the advice of close friends, well-trained cattle breeders. The couple borrowed some funds to start up the business. They later earned enough to repay their debts in time. Now that the business allows her to cover her costs, Anarkul gathered together this group, which she believes deserves financial assistance from Kiva lenders. Anarkul is a very responsible and self-organized leader who promises to repay the loan on time. Her personal purpose for the loan is to purchase extra heads of cattle for further resale. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

He is 16 and goes to preparatory school.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Glora is a very hard-working, happy, and chatty woman who, more than 15 years ago, with the support of her husband, opened a little grocery store in her home with the idea of helping her husband a little with the household expenses. With the passage of time, her business has been growing and providing more. She says that she and her family tend to the business, which is open every day from eight in the morning until nine at night, and she always likes to have even just a bit of everything so that her customers always find what they need and thus are encouraged to come back to buy from her.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to invest in the purchase of rice, beans, soup, oil, bleach, soap, sweets, toilet paper, sugar, coffee, salt, and soft drinks to restock her business and continue with her sales.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Gloria hopes that with this loan her business will continue growing, since she wants to support her son so that he can study for a career.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Abel, who sells bread; Georgina, who sells beverages; Maria, who sells handicrafts; Antelma, who sells handicrafts; Dulce Maria, who has a nutritional club; Leonor, who sells cosmetics; Lidia, who sells tupperware; Maribel, who sells chicken;

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

He has owned his own store for the past 28 years. Irshad baji is the mother of four kids: three sons and one daughter. All of her kids are currently attending the local school, and one of her sons is memorizing the holy book \u201cQuran-e-Pak\u201d. \r\n<p>\r\nIrshad baji is a very responsible lady. She helps her husband at the family business, making sweetmeats. She has successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). She is applying again for a loan to buy materials (sugar, cooking oil and dry fruits) to expand her husband\u2019s sweetmeat business. \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined her current loan group with several women in her local community, all of whom are seeking to expand their family businesses. Sugran baji wants a loan to buy clothes for her clothes selling business. Atharan baji wants a loan to expand her sweetmeat selling business. Maryam baji wants a loan to buy another buffalo for her milk selling business. Ashran baji wants a loan to drive an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle).\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.

Thanks to the house she was able to build, her children have grown up under a roof where they have passed the best years of their childhood. Her desire to advance led her to work selling cosmetics, which she has learned to manage over time. In the beginning, she was owed many debts, but came to realize that being constant in collection and attending to her customers was most important. After obtaining some experience, her business grew little by little and now she is about to become one of the head promoters of the line she sells, as her great abilities have made her one of the best beauty consultants. This motivates her to continue advancing, and she hopes that with time she will not be just another employee, but rather a manager with a stand of diverse products so people will not have to wait to place orders--they will have the convenience of finding better products in her store. Gladys has worked with MFP for more than four years; this is her eighth loan. Along with her group companions, she strives to keep working with much commitment and responsibility. With the 800 soles she is soliciting, she will take advantage of catalog discounts and acquire greater quantities of products to sell them at better prices and generate an additional income in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 65 years old, is widowed, and has eight adult children.\r\n\r\nLaureta owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Laureta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nLaureta is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her 4th from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Anonang, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling crabs in the local community. Ledenisa has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ledenisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ledenisa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional crabs to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Ledenisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to pay tuition for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Now his mototaxi has begun to experience some technical problems that urgently need repair  to be able to run correctly.  That is why he is asking for a loan for the first time with Edpyme Alternativa of 1000 new sols.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He did the same in secondary school, until he finished secondary school. Afterwards, he had to work to be able to survive and he began to work in butchering pigs and later cattle. With the first cow he bought and sold he made C$4,000 cordobas. He also was able to transfer his business to the downtown of the El Regadio community, town of Estel\u00ed, to sell meat in the local markets of Estel\u00ed. He dis this without leaving farming behind, the activity he learned as a child.  \r\n \r\nHe is asking for the loan to buy cattle, since in this way he hopes to increase his sales as well as his customers. \r\n\r\nAmong his plans is becoming the exclusive provider of meat to the supermarkets.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past five years, since her husband\u2019s death, Ajarkul and her oldest son are also raising and reselling cattle. \r\n\r\nShe has always seen the high potential of raising livestock in the village of Kyzyl Suu in Issyk Kul province due to its highland pastures. The fresh air and favorable climate create nice living conditions for local livestock. Earning 3000 soms a month assists her with covering major expenses for her youngest son who is a third grade student. \r\n\r\nThe expansive household of Ajarkul has attracted a lot of attention from local and foreign wholesale dealers. The process of reselling is intensive this current season and Ajarkul is busy with buying young calves and sending them to pasture. The short term goal is to buy several more young livestock for further fattening and reselling.

However, when Friendship Bridge gave them the opportunity for a loan, they decided to change their future. <P>\r\nThe majority of these clients are asking for a loan of approximately $300 US dollars.  This reflects that these women are having business success.  The success of their businesses can also be seen as a product of their constant work.  The loan that this group is requesting will be their tenth from our institution. <P>\r\nThe women will primarily use their loans to buy raw material in order to make typical dresses and in order to purchase and sell them. Although the credit that the majority of the women will receive will be invested in fabric and thereby could cause a saturation of the market, these clients are confident in the success of their business because Nahual\u00e1 weaving is in great demand due to its quality and beauty. <P>\r\nDo\u00f1a Lucia Quich\u00e9 would love for her business to expand so that she could buy a car and not have to carry her merchandise to market every day.

Ella vende materiales reciclables como cart\u00f3n, botellas, metales, fierros y chatarras (como las latas de bebida), negocio al cual se dedica desde hace 39 a\u00f1os.

Para Mar\u00eda Magdalena es muy importante mantenerse ocupada y \u00fatil, ya que hace un tiempo tuvo depresi\u00f3n y su negocio le ayud\u00f3 a recuperarse.\nTemuco es la capital de la regi\u00f3n de la Araucan\u00eda. La ciudad se ubica a 670 kil\u00f3metros al sur de Santiago (capital de Chile) y posee una serie de balnearios lacustres y una flora y fauna nativa muy llamativas. Cabe destacar que en esta regi\u00f3n habita el 50% de los mapuches, pueblo ind\u00edgena, existente en nuestro pa\u00eds.

It is made up of 18 members, residents of the city of Temuco. They work in different independent businesses such as: pastrymaking, manufacturing of saddles and spurs, sewing, selling used clothes, firewood and charcoal, and recycling copper, bronze and aluminum.  \r\n\r\nThe member who was interviewed was Mar\u00eda Magdalena, the president of the group. In the photo, she is seated in the first row, fourth from the left. She sells recyclable materials such as cardboard, bottles, metal, iron, and scrap (such as beverage cans). She has been at the business for 39 years.  She has two adult children and her daughter also belongs to this group and sells fast food.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Magdalena will invest this loan in merchandise, since she doesn't only collect but also buys whatever she needs.  She also has the motivation to begin to sell french fries in a cart she outfitted a little with previous loans. The cart is at her house. For this she will buy oil, potatoes, paper, condiments (ketchup and mustard), and napkins. \r\n\r\nFor her it has been very important to work with Fondo Esperanza. It has been a big financial, moral and motivational support, thanks to the weekly meetings in which she shares with the other members and learns about how to manage her business. For  Mar\u00eda Magdalena, it is very important to stay busy and useful. Some time ago she was depressed and her business helped her to get better. \r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. The city is 670 kilometers from Santiago ( the capital of Chile). It has a series of lake beaches and very striking native flora and fauna. It's worth noting that in this region live 50% of the Mapuches, an indigenous group that exists in our country. This area was damaged by the recent earthquake that affected Chile, but this communal bank suffered no ill effects from it.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

","en":"Albina, age 46, lives in her own home in the company of her husband Evaristo (54), with whom she has 3 children. Of her children, she lives only with Neykel (7), because her two older children are working independently. For the past 8 years, Albina has worked in farming and ranching together with her husband, who goes out every day starting at 5 in the morning to work in their fields, where they plant potatoes, peas, corn, alfalfa and a variety of vegetables. Meanwhile, Albina takes care of the 4 cows they are raising, which produce milk every day. Albina and her husband use the milk to make various delicious cheeses. They sell the cheese in local stores and also send it to some relatives who sell it in the weekly markets in the city. What Albina likes most is planting vegetables, because she can use them not only to sell, but also for the family's personal consumption. For the future, she plans to construct a recreational facility for tourists in the house where she lives. She would also like to build a house in the city in order to rent rooms and generate a better income for her family. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is a very active member within her communal bank. She is always talking about honesty, for which she is highly respected by all of the members, who are people of great solidarity and responsibility. Albina plans to invest the funds she is requesting in buying several sacks of guano, which she needs to fertilize her fields that are already planted with peas, alfalfa and corn. In this way she hopes to continue making good progress. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

He is married and has three children ages 9, 13 and 14 years.  All the children go to school.  He lives in his own house with his family and is not responsible for anyone else, and he manages to save 1,000 meticais per month with the help of his wife, who is a businesswoman.\r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane to move to Namaacha District in search of work.  First, he worked as a domestic worker for two years.  Later, Francisco got a better job at Namaacha Secondary School as a Technical Assistant, where it is even possible for him to continue his own studies.  He receives a salary of 4,900 meticais per month, which he applies to household expenses.  With the help of his wife, who is a businesswoman, he even manages to save some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nFrancisco has never had loans with other banks.  This 10,000 meticais loan is his fourth loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva.  He intends to buy construction material (iron, cement, sand, stone and other materials) to continue work on his house.  The first three loans (for 5,000 meticais, 10,000 meticais and 10,500 meticais) were used for housing (securing the title to the land and beginning construction).\r\n\r\nHe is confident that he will pay off the loan ahead of schedule and request a new loan to set up electrical service and paint his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":619173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

His main crops are coffee and bananas, which after each harvest he sells his production in the city of L. Merced and Santa Ana, where he constantly travels.  \r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is that he is able to distract himself and concentrate in improving his harvests, since he still misses his wife, who was his \"partner, friend, and companion\".  In honor of her memory, he hopes to get ahead, and set the objectives that he is thinking about.  One of them is to obtain more agricultural land, where he can sow in greater quantities.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan with MFP, and he feels grateful for his community bank, that gave him the necessary strength in this difficult stage of his life.  He is thinking about investing the loan in the purchase of several sacks of fertilizer for the coffee that he is growing, since very soon he will transfer the coffee plants from the nursery.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":649371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T07:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1.21,"local_amount":3.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850437},{"amount":53.94,"local_amount":148.8,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":151.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666704},{"amount":669.85,"local_amount":1847.85,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1878.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714194}],"funded_date":"2010-11-24T18:14:12Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":255554,"name":"Lom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lom C.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":215427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy soda, water, lotions, soaps, vouchers, rice, cooking oil, and wheat flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T13:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T15:41:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970668},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886885},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436145},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130418},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027220},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613258},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010341},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232652},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664468},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105213}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T14:41:05Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":74446,"name":"Thavy's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thavy S. is 22 years old, married, and has one young child.

After a number of years of apprenticeship, she became well-versed in the ways of commerce and had enough experience to continue on her own. She decided to sell ati\u00e9k\u00e9 20 years ago and enjoys an excellent reputation in the \"ch\u00e2teau\" market and in all the town of S\u00e9gou where she has innumerable customers. Her \"Atiek\u00e9\" (granulated cassava) is carefully sieved before being filled into sacks or plastic wrappers. <P> \r\n\r\nSo as to satisfy her clientele and grow her business, she came to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She has been working with us for several years. After 5 group loans and 2 individual loans, all reimbursed without difficulty, she is on her third individual loan. <P>\r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy 3 tons of ati\u00e9k\u00e9 in the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

she was a small girl, Gulnora has been entirely dedicated to work. She buys and sells sheep. Until now this has been the most important source of income for her. Her work consists of raising sheep and, after fattening them, she sells them at the best price and makes her profit. In the future she wants to start another business. In the meantime she will continue dedicating herself to sheep raising. Right now she wishes to expand her business and purchase more sheep. That is the reason that Gulnora asked for a loan of 4500 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElvie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Elvie owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elvie has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elvie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elvie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elvie is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Elvie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Since she was a teenager Rene has enjoyed contributing to her family. Every morning they would go to their main source of income, the cultivation of cacao, where she worked and sowed the land. For this work her parents gave her pocket money for personal expenses. \r\n\r\nCurrently she produces and sells cacao and coffee. She stresses that all the knowledge she acquired during her adolescence has carried over into her agricultural business and is yielding good economic results. The product she offers is of the highest quality and is reasonably priced. In general she works with her partner and together they make a good working team, but at harvest time she's in charge of her workers and aims to facilitate the extraction and transfer of her agricultural products to the town's commerce center to sell to customers and improve her quality of life.

Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evangeline from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":637831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-11-13T14:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:23:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5481.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211235027}],"funded_date":"2010-11-14T18:00:19Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:23:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trupti  Kamath","image":null}},{"id":251474,"name":"Aura Olaya","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Portoviejo, capital de Manab\u00ed conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  como la ciudad de los reales tamarindos, se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas  las socias del Banco Comunal Libertad #1.\n \nDesde hace ya 8 a\u00f1os la se\u00f1ora Aura es socia del Banco Comunal Libertad # 1 y est\u00e1 muy contenta ya que gracias a los cr\u00e9ditos que ha recibido de parte de la Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir ha podido sacar a su familia adelante.

His loan is the first loan that he's made with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With it, he will buy raw materials for the preparation of his products, such as cracked corn, cinnamon, milk, bananas, oil and chorizo to expand his sales and also buy chairs and table to achieve a more comfortable atmosphere for his customers.

Ellen researched online and determined that incorporating dogs into a business would be a natural fit for her.\r\n\r\nEllen got her first dog, Trace, knowing that she would train him to become a mold and bed bug detection dog. On the bed bug detection front, she and Trace have a contract with Orkin and she earns a base salary as well as separate referrals. On the mold detection front, Ellen gets her own cases through personal ads and word of mouth. She and Trace only provide mold detection services on the weekends because Trace needs frequent breaks. Trace can only work 4 hours at a time with a minimum 5-hour break, so Ellen has to teach her second dog, Mason, to detect mold. \r\n\r\nEllen found Mason at a local shelter and he was due to be euthanized in the next couple of hours. Both of the dogs come from shelters, so she feels good about taking \u201csociety\u2019s throw-away dogs\u201d and giving them a job to perform. She says it is important to have two dogs to work interchangeably so they can have breaks in between. Both Trace and Mason are a big part of Ellen\u2019s family, and have the love and attention of four teenagers.\r\n\r\nThis loan from Accion USA will enable Ellen to have her second dog trained for detection services.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Los mil quinientos soles que viene solicitando los va a derivar a la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, para que pueda abonar los meses necesarios para sus cultivos.","en":"Santiago is 50 years old.  He lives with his mother and 5 children.  Three of them migrated to other cities and now he is left with the 2 youngest.  They are the reason for his work.  He gets up very early to chop up the fire wood his wife uses to prepare their daily food and then he goes to do his farming chores.  He mainly grows potatoes.  He has learned the tricks of the trade in these years as a farmer so he doesn\u2019t lose anything in any of his crops.  Sometimes his production is reduced due to the poor soil from lack of fertilizers.  Santiago takes care to fertilize his plants as many times as needed to obtain abundant harvests since he has 5 hectares of land.  Now he has potatoes to harvest which he hopes to trade in the markets of Lima to gain a better profit.  He wants to increase and vary his crops by planting peas which he thinks are very profitable also.  Santiago is very happy with the work he does.  He plans to continue growing with his land in the future.  He has worked with MFP for three consecutive loans and has had no payment problems.  On the contrary, he cancelled his loan ahead of some due dates and he is committed to continue working in the same way for this loan cycle.   He will use the loan for one thousand five hundred PEN that he has applied for to purchase chemical fertilizers so he can fertilize during the months his crops need it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":325592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-29T13:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996850}],"funded_date":"2009-05-29T19:07:01Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":115422,"name":"Marichu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marichu D. is from the village of Balide, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur.

Chapi D. Yanacoto group are hardworking people that, owing to different circumstances, are looking to improve their lives honorably.  They are engaged in the sale of: food, sweets, candy, handicrafts, and other items.  The members have participated in EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD for over 3 and a half years.  The loans that they have been provided with have helped them very much.  Here are some of their stories:  Bacilia F. Calder\u00f3n has sold fish and fruit for 25 years.  After her husband abandoned her, she had to work in this manner to support her four small children.  She had to figure out how to sell these products in the street.  At first the income was low, because she was not well-known by her customers, so she had to work as a cook in a communal kitchen.  She came to win customers over time, so that her earnings increased; the perseverance of Bacilia maD. the business grow.  In this way she moved her family forward, making sure that her children would study in school, and be well-dressed and fed.  The first loan that Bacilia received from EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD was used to buy utensils and drinks to sell ceviche on the weekends, days that are the best for sales due to the sporting events that take place in the area where she resides.  Two years ago she changed the straw mats in her home to wood to make her family more comfortable, and this was all done with income from her business.  The current loan will be used to purchase plates, vegetables, and meat for the preparation of caldo D. mote (a typical dish of the Peruvian mountains).  This way she will continue to educate her youngest child who is 9 years old.  \r\n\r\nCarmen P\u00e9rez Bendez\u00fa is the treasurer of the group.  She is in charge of making sure that all the members make their payments on their loans.  Carmen began cleaning rooms in a golf club when her oldest child was a year old.  She was a single mother at the time.  She saved a little money and invested in groceries which she sold from a space in her house.  Later she bought two crates of beer with the earnings from her groceries, and this transaction was profitable.  This created more earnings, income that covered her family expenses, such as education for her two children of  fourteen and five years.  In addition, she was able to improve her house and purchase domestic appliances.  She needs capital to invest in soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nAna Rodr\u00edguez G., president of the communal bank, learned how to make handicrafts when she was still in school.  This interested her so much that she obtained more training in this area, taking advantage of her talent in handicrafts to make small dolls, animals, caps, and handbags from corrospun (sheets of plastic) and polartec fabric.  She offers her products to her friends and to the schools to decorate the classrooms of the children.  Her products are so cute that she has obtained an increasing demand from her customers.  She used her first loan to purchase corrospun, silicone, indelible markers, and synthetic cotton to make a Santa Claus, reindeer, little trees, and elves at Christmastime.  These sales have allowed Ana to share the household expenses with her husband, because he does not have a steady job.  In the month of March, he secured the concession of a primary school.  There he sells sandwiches, fruit popsicles, candy and food.  She needs capital to establish this new business and to continue to educate their two children in private schools; their objective is to give them a peaceful life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":394883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T07:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilza Maruja","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines Asiria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Calixta Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermelinda Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Eileen Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nely Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":506.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939353},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780193},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669061},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":1450,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1452.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064521}],"funded_date":"2009-10-22T00:51:43Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":144181,"name":"Kenjaboy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a very persuasive seller, and she always convinces her customers to buy more than one kebab.  What she likes best about her work is talking with her customers.  She has been doing this activity for four years.  The most difficult part is having to stay on the street until late at night because she has to exhaust all that she made for the day.  In time, she hopes to have a location where she can sell her kebabs more peacefully.\r\n\r\nThis is Sandra\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She is happy to have the opportunity of the loan, and she expects to be able to pay it on time.  She participates a lot in her communal bank, and she is a very responsible member.

","en":"The \u201cLas Divinas\u201d (The Divine Ones) communal bank is represented by Marina; it is maD. up of 13 members: 11 women and 2 men.\r\n\r\nMarina is a widow and has two, school-age children, who are her reason to work.  She sells seasonal items door-to-door, in the markets and, in some cases, in offices.  She lives in a house under the anticretico modality. (Anticretico is a transaction not available in the U.S. whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you).  Her greatest expectation is to grow and be able to proviD. her children with a stable home.\r\n\r\nThe other members are involved in a variety of commercial activities such as: clothing sales, vegetable and meat sales, cheese sales, cleaning supplies sales, candle-making, optician supplies, office supplies, and others.  For the most part, they all live in the same area of the city of El Alto.\r\n\r\nWithin the city\u2019s internal marketplace, any business faces a lot of competition, as is true for the rest of the country.  For this reason, the members look for other sales strategies to move their product.  For example:  they set up sales stands in as many markets as possible plus a fixed stand in the central market.  The vast majority of members earn just enough to support their families so the capital offered helps them generate working capital and a savings rate for a future; most of the members are single mothers who must fend for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to increase their working capital and business.  They will buy merchandise, materials, supplies, tools and ingredients.  The group is in its 7th loan with the institution so they have wiD. expectations for growth because they can count on support from Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapita.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

They have eight children who are 27 to 37 years old. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1989 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy welding rods and other stock for her shop so she could continue to save up for future home repairs and education.

Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.
