She is 57 years old and a widowed mother of five adult-aged children. To make a living, Natividad owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Natividad has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities. She chose to lower the amount of her loan from PHP 10,000 to PHP 5,000 because she finds it easier to pay back smaller amounts.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Natividad joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Natividad has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Natividad is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Natividad from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":577326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory & working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tubod, Mahinog, Camiguin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2295.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166858752},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1434.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172124980},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177418775},{"amount":18.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":860.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182557854}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T01:55:06Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:22:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trupti  Kamath","image":null}},{"id":223578,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice C. is currently in the business of selling beans, pulses, and rice at the market and is requesting a loan to stock dried fish and tomatoes to sell.

Sari-sari stores basically sell small quantities of various foodstuffs, grocery items and beverages. \u201cSari\u201d is a native Filipino word for variety. This is a small store that is either attached to the owner\u2019s house or in a small native cottage, not far away from the owner\u2019s house. Such stores are convenient for people in the village who lives far from the marketplace. \r\n\r\nJanice started her variety store through her initiative in dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business; it gives them good proceeds to support the education of her three children. She is requesting a loan of PHP18,000 so that she can have the funds needed to buy more food products and basic household necessities. This will allow her to attract more customers and increase her sales. With profit from her business, she wants to buy a hog for fattening for supplementary income. After four months of raising or fattening, pigs will be sold either alive or slaughtered for meat to be sold per kilo. Her long-term goal is to have her own restaurant someday, so that Janice will give the opportunity of employment to others. \r\n  \r\nJanice dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to another village, so as to send her three children all the way through college, and to have their own beautiful house and lot for comfortable living. Her three children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store. She now feels very happy about the service of ASHI and its KIVA partnership. It gives them a great possibility to pursue their family dreams. She hopes that they continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe has shown herself to be hard-working to make her dreams come true and hopes that her

She lives with Adri\u00e1n who is 59 years old and with whom she had an only child, fruit of a loving and lasting relationship. They live in their own house located in the district of Pichari. Farmer's blood runs through her veins and she grows cocoa. For the most part the people in her area are farmers. Currently she grows cocoa with the help of her son and her husband but at harvest time she has to hire farm labourers. She has been doing this work since she was very young and continues to do so up until now. However, in the future she wants to buy more land in order to produce bigger quantities and so sell her produce to the Pichari collection centres. The only drawback she has is that her plot of land is located in an isolated area without public access which makes it very difficult for her to transport her harvest to the city. This will be her 2nd loan with MFP for which she is very grateful and she agrees once again to make her repayments punctually. With the money that she is requesting she will hire farm labourers to help her care for and maintain her cocoa plantations.\r\n\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":903285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire manual labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-25T13:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":103.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":106.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":108.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":112.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":119.62},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":126.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":129.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":136.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":140.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":145.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":148.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.53,"local_amount":103.11,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":107.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621862},{"amount":143.83,"local_amount":375.22,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":391.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835938},{"amount":45.54,"local_amount":118.81,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":123.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245697},{"amount":45.55,"local_amount":118.82,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:30Z","rounded_local_amount":123.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098830},{"amount":49.59,"local_amount":129.36,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":134.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712945},{"amount":51.28,"local_amount":133.77,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":139.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202049},{"amount":52.79,"local_amount":137.72,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:36Z","rounded_local_amount":143.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097862},{"amount":115.29,"local_amount":300.76,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":313.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400709},{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":82.43,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455267}],"funded_date":"2011-10-26T19:42:32Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":354748,"name":"That","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"That (in the photo) sells Chinese noodles with soup in her village.

Adakou \u00e2g\u00e9e de 43 ans. Aujourd\u2019hui, elle est une veuve et a \u00e0 sa charge six (06) enfants.

Elle a donc besoin aujourd\u2019hui d\u2019un cr\u00e9dit de $ 450 pour constituer un fond de commerce pour l\u2019approvisionnement, le transport et le stockage du bois de chauffe pour augmenter ses activit\u00e9s et d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie de sa famille.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":3103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Fire woods supplying,transportation and storage ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"An\u00e9ho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2006-11-09T22:56:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adakou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-24T06:19:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2006-12-28T09:32:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-31T19:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3720},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-01-31T06:00:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-31T19:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5734},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-01-31T06:01:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-01-31T19:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5745}],"funded_date":"2006-11-10T06:19:30Z","paid_date":"2007-01-31T06:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5602,"name":"Kossi T.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born in 1967, Mr. Kossi T.

They have named their group Believe in God. This is a group of local entrepreneurs in Makeni City. This is the fourth time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one of them in the group received a loan of (~US$250) SLL 800,000. Meaningful changes were created in lives of these people with those previous loans. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees, in cases where times were difficult for their husbands. They also were able to add to the daily allowances that their husbands gave them for food. Today, they are requesting a loan of (US$ 315) SLL 1,000,000, each, to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nMariatu K. (second from left) is the leader of the group.

The cost of each item varies between 120 and 500 MZM, and her inventory turnover is good.

She currently applied for a loan in the amount of P8,000 to buy more scrap fabrics from garment factories which she will use for the production of foot rugs.\r\n\r\nJuliana is very thankful for having a happy family.

Little by little she has made her business grow, and by offering her clients to pay in installments her orders are getting bigger. Now her business is running normally. However, she would like to continue bettering herself and her business so her situation will be stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of $1400. With this money, Nortoji will be able to buy seasonal fabrics. The power to help her business grow is in your hands.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is his first individual loan, which he intends to use to buy 10 baskets of smoked fish at Konna (in the Mopti region).He will purchase the fish from the fishermen and sell his goods at the Koutiala fish market to  a clientele of both men and women, retail for cash ,and on credit.\r\nChaka foresees a profit of 180.000FCFA per month which he will use to pay the Soro Yiriwaso interests, to meet the family needs and to invest in his business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":640491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of smoked fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-11-17T10:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chaka  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":83934.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613671},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83934.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752122},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":83934.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606384},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83934.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918032},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":83934.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360957},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83934.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226267}],"funded_date":"2010-11-18T16:10:41Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":252286,"name":"Virginia Griselda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Virginia Griselda S.

She has shown that during her 17 years running her business that she is a very creative person.  In the beginning, she only sold kitchen and plastic items, however, she didn't make much profit so she had to change her merchandise.  Currently, she sells crafts that she makes herself.  She has been doing this for 5 years and has a workshop in her house.  Her family also helps her in this business.  She makes ornaments called \"ollitas de la abundancia\" [abundance pots] for which there is a high demand in other cities.  Because of this she has to travel constantly to ensure her sales and income.  She enjoys this activity because she considers it a hobby that she has turned into a source of income, thus allowing her to support her family along with her husband.

He has been a farmer since he was a young. He comes from a family of farmers, who taught him everything about this business. He mostly plants potatoes and onions. \r\n\r\nThroughout all these years of work, Haiyotjon was able to succeed in his business. In the future Haiyotjon is planning to have a bigger stable.

He promises to work responsibly and sincerely thanks all lenders who have decided to support him. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Also, together with her husband, she buys and sells fish.  Her husband takes his boat out to sea to fish and sometimes supplies fish to larger boats needing to complete their loads.   Once he is back on land he ships his catch to the city of Manta where he sells to the large companies who make tuna and sardines.

There she has a beauty salon and offers haircuts, hairstyling, blow drying, dying, manicure, and pedicure services.  Her business was born 2 years ago when she decided to generate income for her home, once she arrived to Barranquilla from Ci\u00e9naga Magdalena and studied art.  Her beauty salon started off very small, but little by little, with her dedication, she has managed to form a good clientele, which she hopes to expand every day.  This is the first loan that Mercedes has had with the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy masage supplies, shampoo, conditioners, dyes, and nail polish for her business and to sell to her customers.  She offers accessories to her treatments for an extra charge, and her customers like these a lot.  Her biggest dream and challenge is to have her own home where she can have an adequate space for her business.  Currently her working capital isn\u2019t enough for this.  While Mercedes is working to reach her dream, she continues to make a profit of 30%.  She plans to expand this with perseverance in her

village customers, including ten CBO (Community Based Organization) committee members who help to lead the loan program in the area. Villagers usually grow groundnuts, sesame, pigeon pea, and green gram. \n\nIn this village, transportation networks are weak, as the roads flood during the rainy season, and it is far, about five miles, from the main road of the village. It is struggling with sufficient access to clean water, because one of the water basins could not store enough water and is in need of repair.\n\nThe new loan will enable this community to purchase farming inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides. These are essential inputs to improve crop yields, and thereby crop income. In the future, villagers would like use increased incomes to set up a small store in the village where they can get various farming inputs. This will mitigate the challenge faced by most farmers of having to travel to other villages to buy inputs. \n\nIn addition to farming, villagers will work as construction workers, tailors, and government employees. Young people will typically migrate to the cities in search of economic opportunity.  \n\nPictured above are the committee members from Ta Ma Lann Pin Village CBO: U Htay, U Khin, U Tin, U Hla are sitting behind, and U Win, U Soe, U Nyount, U Myint and U Sein are in front. Additionally, three non-committee members are in the back row.  Included in the photo (second from the left, behind) is CBO member U Khin. His main businesses are farming and livestock. He has six family members and is the father of a small child.

Murod is a 49-year-old married man and the loving father of four children. For 13 years Murod has had a small shop near his house where he sells all kinds of household and foodstuff items. His children (one of them is pictured) help him with the business. He dreams that his children will enter higher education, and that is why he is working hard, together with his wife who always assists him in everything. Murod's business is successful in bringing considerable income to the family. Today Murod wants to expand his business and to increase his working capital for purchasing new goods to sell. With this purpose he is requesting a loan of 10,000 TJS. Murod has had loans from Kiva partner IMON several times already and has demonstrated that he is a reliable client. Murod promises to manage this loan reliably as well.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nMore about IMON International\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is located in a periurban (immediately adjoining an urban area; between the suburbs and the countryside)  area and has a cement house with few basic services.  She began to learn to style hair at the age of 15 and at the age of 18 began to work as a stylist where she learned how to run a beauty salon.  This was her motivation to set up her own salon at age 24 by renting a small locale for it.  Miriam currently does 20 hair cuts per day.  On weekends she does hair coloring and straightening.

Their humble but hospitable home is rented and is located in the Peruvian sierra.  Since a young child, Ra\u00fal, learned work the land with a lot of love like his parents did but due to life circumstances, he migrated to another city for a number of years until he met his wife and had to go back and harvest his father\u2019s land because he could not find a job.  For 5 years, he has cultivated potatoes, green peas, broad beans and corn.  With his wife\u2019s help on the first harvest he found that the sown field was profitable and with the earnings he can take care of his family, which is why daily he makes the effort to work hard.

Her husband is a builder.  He can not work steadily because of the lack of construction work in Bolivia.  Previous loan money was invested in the construction of her house.  This work was done by her husband.  Her daughter knits blankets.

She used the savings she had to buy chickens to sell to her neighbors and friends.  Little by little she started to get income.  She bought a freezer because the chickens no longer fit in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nShe continues in the business as it is the first income she has had since her husband died.  She works everyday selling chickens, turkey, and meats.  She wants to use the loan to buy more chickens, meats, and turkeys for her business.

She was born in a low-income family with many children.

When she was 19, she was given into marriage and moved to her husband\u2019s home, where she still lives with the husband and his elderly parents. At the husband\u2019s place, she continued to work around the house. At that time, the family had one milk cow and a plot of land where they cultivated clover and barley. Later, their livestock grew and they got sheep and a horse.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, Nesipkul gave birth to their only son. During all these years, their efforts were aimed on supporting and expanding their household and Nesipkul never dealt with any other business. Five years ago, the D.\u2019s son married and moved out. In 2009, Nesipkul got a loan from another bank to buy a car. The loan was used as intended and was repaid without any delays.\r\n\r\nNow Nesipkul requests a loan to buy five calves and to harvest clover and barley.

She lives in her own home in the village of Picoy with her husband Marcos, 36, and their only daughter, Yulisa, who is 13 years old. Marcos and Yuliza are the inspiration for all her hard work. Through great effort and sacrifice, Carmen has been able to work her lands and make them very fertile. She grows potatoes and peas, which she then carries to the city of Tarma to sell at wholesale. Her harvests have provided enough income to support her family, which is why she wants to put everything she has into growing her business. She also works weeding the crops in neighboring fields in her spare time, for which she earns 15 soles a day. She is confident that she'll be able to earn enough money to acquire fields along the river, which will be easy to irrigate and improve her harvest. What she likes most about her job is taking care of her crops. She's been farming for four years and thinks the hardest part is taking her product to the wholesale market in Tarma, since the sacks are very heavy and tire her out. In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and earn more income. She plans to start growing flowers on her land in anticipation of November, when demand for flowers goes up because of the national holidays. She is a member of the Exaltaci\u00f3n Santa Cruz village bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP. She is happy to know that she will have financial support in meeting her goals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to a business executive who guides and counsels her in the management of her store, which is unusual in this area. She generates a good income these days and foresees selling even more for the festivals at the end of the year. To establish a stock of fashionable items, she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy high quality shoes, shirts, and dresses for children, as well as baby bottles currently in fashion. She is the mother of two children and believes that this loan will bring positive change to the development of her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Josephine has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined GDMPC in 2011 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP to invest in expanding her business by purchasing farm products from her neighbors to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated with her loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":783200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase farm products from her neighbors to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-06-08T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.15,"local_amount":1526,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1649.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216514126},{"amount":11.85,"local_amount":474,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":512.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221679412},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227048088}],"funded_date":"2011-06-08T15:08:54Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:19:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":309685,"name":"Damaso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Damaso  tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene 4 hijos, dos en edad escolar y dos ya mayores de edad, vive en la ciudad de Carapegua, compa\u00f1\u00eda Espartillar.\nDon Damaso  trabaj\u00f3  como empleado de un Surtidor por mas de 7 a\u00f1os y con el transcurrir del tiempo fue adquiriendo capital  para  comprar mercader\u00edas y as\u00ed  iniciarse como vendedor ambulante.\nRecorre por ciudades de Alto Paran\u00e1 ofreciendo y colocando  productos de primera calidad, transport\u00e1ndose en su motocicleta, que gracias a este trabajo logr\u00f3 comprarse todo esto con el objetivo de brindarle a su familia la manutenci\u00f3n necesaria y un hogar digno y confortable.\nCon el cr\u00e9dito realizara la compra de mercader\u00edas (hamacas, frazadas, fajas y s\u00e1banas) puesto que tiene muchos pedidos de estos productos.","en":"Damaso is 49 years old, married, and has four children.

Desde muy joven fue fot\u00f3grafo en las playas y como aparecieron nuevas tecnolog\u00edas y todo el mundo ten\u00eda su propia c\u00e1mara, dej\u00f3 este negocio y hace 6 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 una actividad de comercializaci\u00f3n de ranchos, v\u00edveres, enlatados refrescos embutidos, en su vivienda observando que en este sector no contaba una tienda. Al principio sus ventas fueron muy bajas, pero fue persistente y ha logrado paulatinamente crecer y sostenerse. Su mercado est\u00e1 compuesto por una clientela de pensionados de una empresa portuaria, a quienes Hugo le acredita v\u00edveres y le pagan mensualmente, as\u00ed mismo amas de casa que le compran de contado y diariamente. Su trato amable y los precios que ofrece hacen que sus clientes sostengan relaciones de fidelidad.

Ever since he was very young he was a photographer at the beaches.  As new technologies appeared, everyone in the world had their own camera.  \r\n\r\nHe left this business and six years ago he started selling foodstuffs, snacks, canned goods, soft drinks, and sausages at his house.  He observed that his area did not have a store.  At first his sales were very low.  However, he was persistent, and he managed to gradually grow and support himself.\r\n\r\nHis market is comprised of customers who are pensioners from the Port Authority.  Hugo gives them credit for provisions, and they pay him monthly.  At the same time, housewives buy from him daily and pay cash.

She requested her loan to stock her store.  She will buy sugar, oil, chocolates, eggs, soap, milk, rice, soft drinks, corn, beans, and sweets.

A neighbor invited her to establish the store, and they set it up together.  The woman was single, and she did not want to continue with the business.  That is how Camila continued on with the store by herself.  Her business is important because it helps with the food, and it helps pay for the telephone and electricity.  She is proud to have her grocery store and of working in the fields.\r\n\r\nShe grows seasonal corn, which she plants each year.  Her business is well-known because she tends to her customers in a good-natured way.  Her sister and her niece also help her tend to the customers.  Her business faces competition from some stores, but each one already has their customers.  She uses the income from her business to pay the field workers and to pay for electricity and the telephone.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to buy some pigs and calves to raise and later sell.  Her dreams and hopes are that God continues helping her to continue in her work.  She is thrilled with this loan that she is going to receive.

Reyna is thankful for the opportunity the loan provides -- building is expensive and she wouldn't be able to build the wall otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":377915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"buy construction materials to build a wall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.78,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":796.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875879},{"amount":43.97,"local_amount":879.42,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":900.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713797},{"amount":44.09,"local_amount":881.73,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":903.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601492},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":686.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":703.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002944},{"amount":33.17,"local_amount":663.32,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":679.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841097},{"amount":52.23,"local_amount":1044.53,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874008},{"amount":25.54,"local_amount":511.03,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":523.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136603943},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.78,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":796.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639399},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.76,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":796.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821182}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T18:08:55Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":136794,"name":"Bashorat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I. Bashorat is 48 years old. She\u2019s married with two children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 20 years she is purchasing the young cattle and calves in the local market, fattens and sells them. Bashorat is a very hard-working woman and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. Bashorat wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. Her husband (pictured) actively helps her with operations. Thanks to this activity she is supporting her children with education. Bashorat wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. With this purpose she is requesting a loan of $ 800 USD to buy calves in order to expand her business. Let\u2019s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live.     \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lina is now requesting a new loan of 1450 WST which will be used to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is known as a person who sets her whole heart on her pupils' education. Taking into account her striving to make children progressive, she is titled as an Honoured Education Worker.  \r\n\r\nAs it is known, in rural areas, the salaries of teachers are low and do not cover all the expenses of a household. That\u2019s why these people need to find an additional means of subsistence for their families. Kulbara, like many others in such a situation, began her own business in cattle breeding and land cultivating. Starting from buying one cow, she managed to enlarge the number of livestock to 10 sheep, one milk cow, one calf and one horse. Also, Kulbara has a beautiful small-scale garden with apples, pears and raspberries, which gives her some earnings for supporting her children. For her family use, she dries these fruits and makes provisions for the winter. \r\n \r\nNow, Kulbara wants to take a loan of 60,000 Kyrgyzstan soms (KGS) to buy five bull-calves for fattening and reselling. With the revenues from this investment, she plans to build a house for her family. In the future, Kulbara plans to develop her farm by means of livestock breeding.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to buy raw materials for her tailoring business so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children's education and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nLetecia T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site, the city of Bamenda. He plans to use the profits generated to sponsor his children in school and to cater to the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nHe and his wife, Ndum Mispa, have six children. His wife joined GHAPE in 2010 because she found that she could not take care of the family singlehandedly (a situation exacerbated by problems with her in-laws) and the children lacked basic care. These problems are saddening to Fuh I., but he is grateful to be alive and is driven to give his children the love and education they need. He states that \"he feels better each time he provides something small to his children.\" \r\n\r\nHe needs investment capital that can constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs, and his inability to obtain such capital is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerrment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Working the earth has been part of her daily routine since childhood.  Her parents were farmers and when she got engaged to her husband, she devoted even more time to this work.  About five years ago, in addition to other crops, Delia began to plant flowers, and she is very happy with her work and what the fields she sows produce.  Last October she sold flowers at a good price because of All Souls' Day.  Twelve dozen flowers sold for between 70 and 80 soles, but at other times of the year the price drops to only 20 soles.  Due to this factor, Delia tries to plant at the proper time to harvest in those months when the price is better, but much also depends on rainfall, irrigation and fertilizer.  She also continues to plant vegetables like carrots and spinach to provide an alternate source of income for their home.  Delia has taken out five loans with MFP without a problem, and has promised to repay her sixth loan on time.  With the money she has requested, she will purchase fertilizer for the flowers.  Without fertilizer the earth does not produce, Delia says, because planting flowers exhausts the soil.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":254805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer for flowers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T17:20:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2566.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996394}],"funded_date":"2009-01-14T17:26:47Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":87610,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George K. sells frozen fish at Nyankumasi near Cape Coast.

His wife is a hairdresser for a private company. He lives in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent, and operates a taxi service in his town. He began his business in 2007 after working and living in Korea for two years. Since then, his working capital has grown and he plans to open a hair salon for his wife. Within a short period of operating his business, he has gained a good professional reputation among the people of his town as a safe, reliable driver. Surenhorloo would eventually like to buy a larger, more comfortable car so that he can transport more people across longer distances, which would increase his profits. He is requesting a 1,500,000-tugrug loan to purchase replacement parts for his taxi so that he can keep getting his customers where they need to go and furniture for his

Within this competitive environment, the group already has regular customers who are familiar with its work and ask for its services and products.  The group is enthusiastic about what it does.\r\n\r\nThis credit will be used as working capital for buying merchandise, raw materials, and work tools.  The group expects to keep working in order to grow and to increase its profits so its members can give their families a better quality of life.  Their bank is already familiar with this group--it is not their first loan, but their third funding cycle.  They have previously demonstrated that they are responsible, united, and hard-working enough to look to the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ross Forman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":545012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gaby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ascencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gavina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2187.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2212.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2238.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2264.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2291.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2317.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2345},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2372.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2400.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2456.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2485.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":207272,"name":"Hourt","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hourt S. is one of many Cambodian people who earn a living by planting crops.
