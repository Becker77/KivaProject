She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and a pig fattening business. Her 40 year old husband, Ledeganio C., works as a carpenter to earn his living and he also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children, 13 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000. She intends to use the funds as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the family's future, to be able to afford a good education for their children and to fight the daily battle of their lives. Ma.

F. has a store in the town of Puerto Colombia.  This is a small coastal town which, at the beginning of the twentieth century, was home to the most important shipping port in the country.  This small businesswoman is a hairdresser by profession and, over many years, she worked in several beauty salons.  Five years ago her husband, who was a salesman in an electrical appliance store, lost his job and this was when the idea to create her own business was born.\r\n\r\nAt first, the store was not very well stocked with foodstuffs but, over time, it improved.  Janeth also acquired display cases, shelves and refrigerators.  Now she divides her time between her trade as a shopkeeper and her hairdressing services which she offers in people's homes.\r\n\r\nThis is Janeth's third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to invest the money in buying general foodstuffs.  She has always been noted for her excellent punctuality.  Her business has a monthly sales volume of 5,000,000 Colombian pesos and her average profit margin is 20%.  Janeth plans, next year, to rent larger premises so that she can transfer her store and adapt the self-service system.  She says that she enjoys her business as a shopkeeper a lot because it allows her to be in permanent contact with the neighbors in her community.  Her greatest satisfaction is not the money that her small business makes but rather the appreciation that her customers all show

She lives with Nerio, 33, and their 5 children in a house that they own in Nueva Esperanza, a town in Quimbiri.  Hilda and Nerio support the family.  Hilda has been a farmer--work that she learned from her parents--since she was a girl.  She owns 4 hectares of land where she grows coffee, achiote and coca, all plants native to the Rio Apurimac valley in the Peruvian Amazon.  She started working the land for herself 17 years ago.  At harvest time, she can count on the help of both her children and temporary day laborers who she needs to get her crop in quickly.  Hilda likes harvesting her crops because the harvest is her reward for many months of working hard to grow the very best crop she can.  The most difficult thing about the business, she says, is getting the crop from her fields to the market in the town of San Francisco where she can get the best price for her crop.  Her immediate problem is that she doesn't have the equipment she needs to process her coffee beans.  She is applying to MFP for a loan to buy the equipment she needs.  She has 2 hectares of uncultivated land and, in the future, she wants to plant more coffee there.  This is Hilda's first MFP loan.

Mwanne has been running her crop business since 2002.  \n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Mwanne currently earns about $45 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $425 USD to purchase more rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to expand her business by adding more quantity and range of the stock . Mwanne thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Edivina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,800 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for personal purposes.

She went out to look for work but couldn\u2019t find any employment.  Seeing that she couldn\u2019t find a way to generate her own income she visited a friend in the market who gave her the idea of selling prepared meals since this market didn\u2019t have anyone doing this kind of work.  She didn\u2019t have to think about it very long.  She rented a stall with the little funds she had and started to sell food like: beans, lentils, wheat, etc.\r\n\r\nShe started out selling just a few kilos but now her business has grown quite a bit.  She currently offers more variety and quantity.  She also has to fry up more meals and she went into the diced vegetable sales business, something housewives were requesting.  Thanks to her efforts and work she has managed to reach many goals.\r\n\r\nOne of them was to build her house where she also has several rental units that she will lease to earn extra income.  She will use the loan to finish part of the construction.  She also wants to buy herself a mototaxi (three-wheel vehicle used to transport passengers and cargo) because she spends a lot of time moving her ingredients to the market where she works.\r\n\r\nFor the future she\u2019s looking for an additional market where she can install her business so that she can grow.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has just been named the new President of the \u201cSAN JUAN MASIAS\u201d communal bank which is composed of 7 hard working members like her.\r\n\r\n* Mar\u00eda is at the end of the row, the last one on the right, dressed in black.\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":585033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To finish building her rental units.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscila Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryuri Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yanderith Singler","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Isidora Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Melody Soraya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098161},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390830},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529110},{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":1700,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1716.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665219}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T21:33:12Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":227381,"name":"Dioubo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe de solidarit\u00e9 DIOUBO  est cr\u00e9\u00e9 le 05 d\u00e9cembre 2007.

She is 59 years old. Luciana is married and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Luciana owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, junk foods, and canned goods in the local community. Luciana has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Luciana joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luciana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Luciana is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods and junk food. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Luciana from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

because he saw that many businesses in his small town lacked a strong presence on social media communities, and he realized that this was due to the amount of time required to properly manage a social media presence. He says, \u201cIt costs absolutely nothing to get onto Facebook or LinkedIn, but the big price is time, and time, literally, is money when you\u2019re running a business.\u201d Steve aims to take out this problem of time by managing his clients\u2019 social media presence, allowing them to focus solely on running their businesses.\n\nImpresa Social Marketing, which will begin accepting clients on August 1st, will use Steve\u2019s marketing experience to create compelling and regularly-updated business profiles on social media venues like Facebook and LinkedIn. Before starting his business, Steve worked in events marketing, where he learned that social media management was an increasingly important part of his job. This experience serves as the underpinning for Steve\u2019s business practices at Impresa. \n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of his approach to social media management, Steve is now managing three companies promotionally. He says, \u201cWe have about a dozen businesses waiting for us to roll out the business, but I don\u2019t want to start until I have all of my ducks in a row.\u201d The promotional clients serve as both a tool for Steve to perfect his practice and as a way to advertise his services to potential clients. \n\nOne of the most difficult parts of beginning Impresa has been emphasizing the importance of a regularly updated and constantly changing social media presence to his clients. \u201cI would get a lot of people saying, \u2018Well, my nephew made my Facebook page already.\u2019 The problem with this is that social media is organic; it needs to be constantly changing in order to keep the interest of potential customers.\u201d Though this was a problem initially, the success of Steve\u2019s promotional clients has been enough to illustrate the importance of the type of social media presence that his business aims to create.\n\nThis loan has allowed Steve to lay the groundwork for his upcoming grand opening. With it, he purchased computer equipment, such as a PC pad, and software called Market Me, which will allow him to manage all of his clients\u2019 pages at one time. This will allow him to take on a large number of clients without worrying about wasting time toggling between several screens.\n\nSteve says one of his business\u2019 biggest assets is that it is \u201cin your area.\u201d Working directly with clients by going to their places of business to take pictures and interact with the business owners is extremely important to the success of his business. In the future, he hopes to expand by placing account managers in other areas \u2013 this will allow him to continue to offer the one-on-one service valued by his customers while extending his business\u2019 reach beyond its current borders of his small town.\n\nYou can visit Impresa Social Marketing\u2019s website at

During the spring and summer months it's very simple to feed the cattle because fodder is widely available, but she does not have the money. Buburoziya decided to get a loan which will help her realize her plans. She can also sell the milk from the cow which will bring additional income to her family.

He lives with his wife and children in the H\u00e8r\u00e8makono Nord district of Bougouni City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After Koran school in the village, he decided to get situated in Bougouni City to earn an income.  For years, he tried different kinds of work unsuccessfully.  In the end, he opted for an eatery business selling coffee, Lipton, and fried meat and liver at the Bougouni bus station.  He learned this business from one of his friends.  After three years of experience, he has a good command of it and is highly appreciated and in demand by young people, workers at the station, and drivers (travelers, chauffeurs, apprentices, couriers, etc.)  \r\n\r\nIn his search for supplemental financial resources, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first individual loan.  Each day, he intends to buy bread, sugar, containers of coffee and milk, mayonnaise, liver, meat, Lipton, etc.  Supplies are gotten in Bougouni from wholesalers, and sales are made at the bus station to customers composed of several socio-professional groups.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. D. plans to realize a monthly profit of 22,500 francs CFA that will enable him to improve not only his enterprise but particularly the care and support of his family.  His ambition is to open a general store in Bougouni.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is a mother to six children who are all minors. She is married to Aldwin, a construction worker (laborer). The salary of her husband is insufficient for their daily needs.\r\n\r\nAs a woman of dreams, in 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines. Since then, she started selling dry goods and it really helped them to meet their needs. Now on her ninth loan, she proposes the amount of 20,000 pesos to pay for a variety of dry goods.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of ASHI and Kiva, she can reach her ambition to step out from poverty, expand her business and pay for the needs of her six children in

He lives in his own house with his brother, whom he supports.  Joaquim Lu\u00eds also supports his own son who lives with his mother.\r\n\r\nHe left Beira for Maputo by himself 15 years ago to live with his parents; in Beira, he had lived with his aunt and uncle.  He is a teacher and has been on the staff of the Ministry of Education for 5 years; he works from 12pm to 5pm.  He graduated six years ago from the Primary Education Institute in Chibututuine.  As a teacher, he earns a monthly salary of 6,577 MZN, which he uses to pay for household expenses.  He even saves some in his account with the Millenium Bim bank.\r\n\r\nHe had a loan with the TCHUMA credit cooperative, but decided not to continue with them for various reasons.  He found out about Hluvuku through Mr. Francisco Chamancono who is also a client with the institution.  Joaquim Lu\u00eds has asked Francisco to serve as a guarantor for his loan.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku, which has a value of 12,500 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy construction materials (cement, rebar, sand, zinc plates, etc.) in order to continue building his house.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to ask for more loans to finish and furnish his home in order to ensure better comfort and living conditions for his family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

Rosemarie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 16,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosemarie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Rosemarie is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the eighth loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Tag-ube, Compostela, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store.  Her husband Alejandro B., who is 41 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 19 and 21 years old. \r\n\r\nBelinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Belinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, with which she intends to buy more items for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business.\r\n\r\n Belinda B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His customers come buy supplies from him and this generates income for the family. Hajra shares the financial burden with her husband by selling shawls.

Her other children are enrolled in a local school. Hajra has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to improve her son\u2019s business.

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has eight branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

He lives in the town of Isfara. He is married and has a son. Maruf processes and sells dried fruits in the central local market. He is experienced in the business of dried fruits. He purchases dried fruits from local farmers at wholesale prices and after processing sells them to his customers. Because he buys his goods wholesale, his prices are lower than regular market prices. He offers a wide assortment of goods for clients of different means. All this allows Maruf to make his business quite successful, and it brings in a stable income for his family. Currently, he needs a loan of $800 USD to buy supplies so he can continue to offer quality products to his customers. Maruf expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.    \n\nTajikistan\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 33-year-old Florence M. from Mwanza. She is single with one child, who is 10 years old. Florence has been running a beauty saloon since 2007. This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair or blue hair and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee.\n\nFlorence currently earns about $150 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair and blue hair. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Florance thanks you for the support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair and blue hair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010847},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233133},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664924},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105636},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022746},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867986},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757187},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146299},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984461}],"funded_date":"2009-05-13T23:04:25Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":111842,"name":"Loreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Loreta L. is 47 years old and is from Dolores, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

It is a unified group that, as cycles pass, has removed members that do not participate until  the most responsible and supportive persons are left.  They all live in the \"El Recreo\" housing development in an area away from the city.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria del Carmen is the new president of the group.  She focuses on the sale of dinner during the week. On weekends she serves breakfast, preparing Patasca [a nutritious sheep and beef soup].  The loan is for the purchase of basic products so that she can prepare her delicious dishes.\r\n\r\nMr. Luis is a long time member who owns a small business repairing cell phones and selling parts in the Plan 3000 [an area in the city of Santa Cruz] market.  The loan is for the purchase of tools and parts for cell phone repair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Noemi is a long time member who has a grocery store in the neighborhood, her store is well stocked.  She considers herself a responsible person, caring for two children and the grandson of a daughter who is in Spain.  Her dream is to open a mini market in the development since she can count on so many customers, her store is one of the most well known in the area.  The loan is for the purchase of groceries in bulk.\r\n\r\nAll of the partners are responsible and hardworking, they are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for their support and for awarding the

She shares six rooms with her children and grandchildren in Bamenda, North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nShe has encountered many difficulties in life including the failure to attain a quality education due to the untimely death of her father, and that of her husband in 2006, which has put her into her present state of trying to support her family. In addition, thieves broke into her home and made off with valuable materials and, in 2000, her house collapsed because of heavy rain and wind. With the many problems and the children under her care, she has still been happy because, among  the widows in her area, she is one of those who gets help from GHAPE solving her problems. If given another loan of 400.000frs, she plans to buy day-old chicks, seedlings, and fertilizer. She is convinced that the business will succeed because a previous loan from GHAPE was successful. The loan will help her community because she will be able to provide general food provisions so they will not need to incur transportation costs to buy in distant places. \r\n\r\nShe will plough her profits back into her business and use part to care for her family, pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. Sthe also hopes to open a workshop for her son.\r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she receives, the follow-up, and that GHAPE does not ask for collateral, as well as the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE: The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

He brings these products from a village called Chibolo in the department of Magdalena. It is known to have more than 16000 inhabitants, alluvial plains, and a few hills. As a native of the region Omar thinks about this place very fondly. He stated out his business when he came into an agreement with a friend to sell something and Omar chose the sale of pork meat. He knew many individuals with much experience in his native town of Chibolo. He started out selling from door to door until he gained a somewhat stable clientele. Later he started out selling form his home and he added other products for sale, such as cheese, whey protein, honey, and poultry. He sells pork on the weekends, averaging between 40 to 50 kilograms. He has a very good clientele among his family, friends, and neighbors. His business is not credit-based. All of his purchases are done in cash and product sales are also for the most part completed in cash. His sales cover his costs and generate a profit that permits him to cover the family's expenses. His liquidity index ratio is good and it is sufficient to fulfill the commitment he plans on undertaking with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). His accounts receivable have a fast turn around as does his inventory. His profitability margins show the efficiency and solvency of the business for future commitments. Omar wants to grow more each day and he needs an additional working capital to attend to his new clientele. For this reason he requests a Kiva loan. it is the first loan that he has with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. He plans on purchasing pork meat in larger quantities. He also wants to increase the days when he makes his ales and to offer better prices.

He is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota where the hot springs of Dangbo are located, in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River, and he is a member of the group GM Miwanou of Hetin Sota. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in B\u00e9nin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing the land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Pierre B. has requested a loan of 165,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 2 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating about 2 hectares, in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":165000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":20625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821562},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357828},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046878},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938496},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396162},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":41250,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":41925.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904039},{"amount":40.65,"local_amount":20625,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":20962.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126047}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T16:01:40Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83186,"name":"Temukisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Temukisa L. is married with children.

She sells these treats from her house, where she lives with her husband Jos\u00e9 and their five children. Anita loves her job. She began selling baked goodies because she is good at it and because she considers it to be less complicated than other tasks. She states that she doesn\u2019t want the complications of taking people\u2019s clothes to wash, or other services \u2013 she enjoys the simplicity of giving someone a few cookies over the counter in exchange for payment.\r\n\r\nAnita has exciting goals for the future of her family and her business. She has a passion for wanting her business to continue to grow \u2013 and with this being her 6th loan cycle with Esperanza, she has shown commitment to her work. She started out small, and with each loan cycle she has been able to expand her business even more. This has benefitted her family as well. Anita is seeking to build up savings for her children. She will be able to help with any future costs, including university tuition fees. These savings will give Anita the ability to help her family in a greater array of situations that may arise in the future. This is the reason that she is focusing on saving and expanding her business.\r\n\r\nAnita, pictured here far left, is the leader of this group of women named Luz en el Camino (Light on the Road), and her story is emblematic of the other women in her group.

Her charisma is one of her most powerful weapons in her work since she is the person charged with collecting fares onboard minibus #12 which provides urban public transportation services on the streets of Juliaca.  Her workday begins very early in the morning and doesn't end until almost 9 at night.  What she most enjoys about the job is being able to converse with the passengers and make the trip more pleasant.  She has had this job for two years and feels that the most difficult part of it is having to stand all day since the passengers take up all the available seats.  For later in the future she would like to own her own minibus with which to work and earn her own profits.  This is Nilda's fourth loan with MFP.  She is aware that she needs to repay in a timely fashion and is prepared to do so since she does not want to cause any problems for her communal bank where she is a well-liked and admired member.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling confectionary products in the local community. Eleoteria has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Eleoteria joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Eleoteria is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered for sale. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Eleoteria from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Nelia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Nelia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelia has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Nelia is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Nelia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He is 41 years old and dedicated to his business selling lunches and occasionally fast food.  His family consists of his wife and three children between the ages of 4 and 14, who are the reason why he strives in his work to get ahead.  This is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he has requested the amount of 1,300,000 COP.  He plans to buy a table and ingredients for preparing lunches and fast food such as rice, oil, margarine, meat, chicken, cheese, sauces, and sausages.\r\n<p>\r\nAlirio is from the Department of C\u00f3rdoba, which is located to the north in the part of Colombia facing the Caribbean Sea.  This area is known for its swamps, livestock fairs, festivals (such as the one celebrating the donkey), pageants, and fertile soil.  Here he started his business five years ago selling soups and lunches.  He continues his business in Barranquilla and has since added fast food such as hot dogs, hamburgers, stuffed \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a>\u201d (corn bread), skewered meats, and kernelled corn.  Alirio has an assistant who help every day preparing lunches for his customers and on the weekends sells his famous hot dogs, hamburgers, and cold cuts.  Since he operates his business out of his home, his family is well-known in the community.

This school was founded in 1964. The school is staffed with eleven teachers and has 287 pupils.   \r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 7,500,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone can not do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials; some will buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while others will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nNat J. is the leader of this group of teachers. Born in Kossoh Town, near Waterloo, Nat is married to a clerk and the couple has seven children who are attending secondary school. Nat has served in the teaching profession for thirty-eight years now.  Nat will use part of his share of this loan to renovate his house and use the rest to buy seeds to plant in his farm.

of experience are like an open book with many lessons to be shared with new generations, just as Mrs. Jacinta Z. is a woman with a humble heart and great courage to share what she knows.  Jacinta and her husband share in common their knowledge about caring for the land, and while only empirical, this knowledge gives good results and support to young farmers in their region.  Jacinta and her husband have become a type of counselor for many residents of their community.  Mrs. Z. learned to farm because she was born and raised in an agricultural family and when she married, she continued to dedicate herself to this activity.  Her marriage has been blessed by a son who is 17 years old and whom she loves very much.  For him she continues exerting herself in agricultural work, sowing potatoes, beans, oats, and barley.  In the past few years, and above all this past year, the region has been troubled by the terrible cold that beat the central part of the country.  This weather created great loss for Jacinta, and despite the sadness that still burdens her heart, she is determined to continue working.  She is planning to open a grocery store in which she will sell the products that she obtains from her fields.  Mrs. Jacinta Z. and her husband will invest your generous help in the purchase of fertilizers.

For example, do\u00f1a Verni cannot rely on potable water that should be supplied by public water basins.  What's more, like many others, she cannot rely on gas services and must buy gas in tanks.  Lamentably, she lives in a zone where distributors of these tanks do not pass very frequently which is why she has to go to busy streets in the hopes that one of these trucks will pass by.  She longs to be able to rely on these services in her home.  The main activity of this group is the weaving of sweaters, scarves, and other pieces of clothing, in Alpaca wool that they later sell in the \"16 de julio\" market in the city of El Alto.  Currently, they want to be able to increase their production so that they can sell their products to handicraft shops.  It is for this that they need more capital for the acquisition of raw materials to make their sweaters.

The village bank, which is comprised of seventeen members, is located in Tuol Sralau Village in Kampong Chang Province. \r\n\r\n<p> Mrs. Un H. is also a farmer in the local village, where she owns a 1.5 hectare rice field. Presently, however, she faces a small problem in her field, as she needs fertilizer, which is quite expensive. Her husband, Mr. Choem Hoeun, is a motorbike taxi driver who can make US $2.5 per day. He also helps his wife in the field, but their income is small for their family. As a result, Un is asking for a loan to purchase fertilizers in order to produce better crops.\r\n\r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. This type of loan allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term, but most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva

Y. is married and the mother of 4 children, of whom two are enrolled in school. She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Mahukpego of Hetin Sota. She also sells smoked fish and palm oil.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. \r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Rosaline D. Y. has requested a loan of 150,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 2 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":237930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 2 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-02-11T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":38700.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357835},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046885},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938503},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396168},{"amount":75,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38700.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904046},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19350.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126054}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T14:05:33Z","paid_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83202,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva is a member of the Orquideas (\u201cOrchids\u201d) Village Bank.

She needed to work and look for a living to support the needs of her children because the business became the main source of income and she receives good income for their future savings in case of emergency. She also earns extra income from her pedicure and manicure business. In 2006; she decided to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. During her membership in ASHI, she was noted for her excellent performance in terms of responding to her responsibilities in the organization.\n\nNow Rowena is requesting a loan of Php20,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for  perfumes, towels, underwear for men and women, blouses, jeans, t-shirts, shoes, bags, slippers, and many others similar items. She has regular customers and she also receives and accepts orders.\n\nRowena hopes to send her children to school until they finish college and find the finest jobs.

This business really helps her family's finances since her husband works in farming and this activity does not provide permanent income. \r\n\r\nRosa wants to grow her business with the purchase of more sheep, but she doesn't have enough capital to do this. This is why she sees the need, for the first time, to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles to help her achieve her goal.  \r\n\r\nShe is a responsible woman, dedicated to her family and she really enjoys her job. Her biggest wish is to continue helping her family to give them a better quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":492015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of sheep to grow her business.
