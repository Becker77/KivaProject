They are close neighbours with a lot of experience in their daily activities.  The group is consists of the following members; \r\n\r\nBessy Rodrigues is 40 years old, she has had a business making and selling tortillas for the past year.  She gets up at 5am to begin her production and then she sells the tortillas from 7am till midday.  She also sells dairy products.  Previously she has a cafeteria where she used to sell sweets and snacks, but she had some problems and she had to give up the business, and now she wants to start again in order to keep moving forward.  \r\n\r\nHeimy is 22 years old and she has spent the last two years selling jewellery such as earrings, rings and watches.  She also sells purses, wallets, shoes and silver chains.  Since she was a small child, she has liked retail sales, and previously she worked as a sales assistant in a private company, but then she decided it would be better to set-up her own business and only have to work for herself.  She also decided to do this because she didn't have anybody to look after her son, and paying for a nanny was very expensive.  Her husband works in Cafe Maya, a private company.  He travels every week to distribute coffee in various communities.  She needs the credit in order to purchase fabric to make wallets, buy perfume scents and underwear.  Her short term aim is to have a big business.  \r\n\r\nRoxana V. is 28 years old, she has 2 years experience with her business.  She sells shoes for women, wallets, curtains, rucksacks, lotion sets, jeans, shirts and sneakers.  She has three children.  She has a lot of faithful customers who visit her in her house to buy these products. She is very friendly and sociable, and as these are characteristics that not everyone has, this is why her customers seek her out.  Previously, she worked in a pharmacy, but she decided it was better to set-up her own business and it gives her more income than the salary she earned in the pharmacy.  She needs the loan in order to buy more clothes, curtains, wallets and sandals.  Her dream is to have a larger shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":287858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase prodcuts and stock for their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T13:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bessy Jeamileth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heimy Yamileth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Waleska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.85,"local_amount":1714.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1753.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36024837},{"amount":255.36,"local_amount":4714.26,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4822.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44610737},{"amount":69.64,"local_amount":1285.71,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1315.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53007528},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":1999.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63229780},{"amount":143.15,"local_amount":2642.86,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2703.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73661366},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":1999.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T01:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87101384},{"amount":197.34,"local_amount":3642.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T05:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3726.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97018423}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T16:04:01Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T05:42:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":99214,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

(pictured above in red) used to be a housewife, until she got a divorce. Now she has her own business. Her kids are still her priority and she insists on calling them her babies, even though they are now 13 and 14. She received a loan with Esperanza two years ago and with that began her business. Nicolasa sells health, beauty, and basic hygiene products from her home; in that way she can still be close to her kids. She lives in Barrio Lindo in San Pedro D. Macoris. Even though translated it means Beautiful neighborhood. Barrio Lindo can have its troubles. To name the most prominent ones, there is no constant running water - sometimes the town is left three to four days without water.  Electricity goes out unpredictably every day,  sometimes for a few hours but sometimes for half a day, and crime has risen so much that you cannot walk by yourself after it gets dark. Yet with all those circumstances Nicolasa\u2019s business has proven to be successful. She is now on her third loan with Esperanza and is quite satisfied with her steady income. She laughs and smiles at me, confessing that she wishes her business can keep on gaining momentum because one day she hopes to own her own car. \r\n\r\nPlease strongly consider loaning to Nicolasa.  She is diligent and deserves an opportunity to grow her business and eventually own her own car. Esperanza thanks you for your time and consideration.\r\n\r\nMaira Flores\r\nSummer Intern

","en":"Maritza is 37 years old and has three children between the ages of 6 and 16.  They live in the town of Malambo, which is 15 minutes away from Barranquilla.  Maritza has a business where she sells basic household goods for cash and sometimes on credit.  Her inventory includes snacks, provisions, soft drinks, canned goods, meats, and other products.  Her main customers are housewives looking to buy ingredients for preparing their daily meals or for cleaning products to use around the home.  Maritza started her business four years ago with some capital given to her by her husband.  Through hard work, she purchased shelving and established the store in her home.  Her business grew gradually and she later equipped her store with a cooler and some display cabinets.  She also renovated the infrastructure so that now she has a larger store.  Two years ago she began renting out her business because she separated from her husband and then went to go live with her mother.  Within the last eight months, she has reclaimed her business due to bad management by her tenant.  Through her daily work, Maritza has managed to press forward and is excited about being able to grow.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy in large quantities those products that have high turnover so that she can obtain discounts for paying with cash and buying in bulk.  Her product turnover period is 28 days and she maintains a profitability rate from her sales of no less than 13.75%.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, groundnuts, beans and maize in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T02:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027620},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613621},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010700},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232986},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664777},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105489}],"funded_date":"2009-03-16T04:24:18Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:51:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":99230,"name":"Pacita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pacita is the mother of three children and the wife of Benjamin A..

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She owns a business venture, cultivating fruit trees & harvesting its fruit for sale.  Meleane has 4 years of experience in this business.  Meleane needs a loan of WST $2750 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nMeleane joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Meleane's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Meleane S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She started in the grocery business in the beginning of 2000. She has a partner in her husband, who helps feed the family by working in construction. This couple is married and has been blessed with four children. One of the children is married and lives separately and others attend school.

She lives with her 5 children, ages between 10 and 21 years in the Chapacua de Cartagena neighborhood, known for the very representative beauty of its queens in the festivals of November 11.  Her business is the sale of miscellaneous products, that she started informally with the sale of merchandise through catalogs of specialized products.  She has run this business for more than five years.  When she learned of the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and received her first loan, she bought her first showcase in order to better exhibit her articles.  Gradually she has grown her business and thought to offer photocopy services in her community.  Therefore with the second loan she bought a photocopier, that has added to her business and with its use she has repaid the loan.  Currently she is applying for a loan of 1,500,000 pesos (about $800 US), which she will invest in the purchase of various merchandise, especially beauty products, school supplies and paper in general.  \r\n\r\nWith her independent activity and the loans received, she has enlarged her working capital and thus improved the standard of living of her family.  She has been able to educate her five children and she has a goal that they all become professionals.

They have all been resolved as they surfaced, but many times she does not have the available cash to buy merchandise which is on promotion that she lacks and her purchase is delayed.  <br

She is 51 years old. Lorna is separated from her spouse and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Lorna owns and operates a business venture raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting, trading and selling bananas, cassava and copra (dried coconut meat) in the local community. Lorna has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lorna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops. This loan will be the third taken out by Lorna from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

They are all from the city of Valpara\u00edso.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Angelica is the treasurer of this communal bank. In the photo, she is seated in the first row of chairs, second from the right. She is wearing a watermelon-colored shirt and has her young daughter on her lap. She sells used clothing for men and women, as well as new clothing for babies. During the Christmas season she also sells toys. She has been working in this business for two years.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Angelica sets up her clothing stand in different open markets twice a week and sells merchandise from her home on the other days. She is also awaiting a municipal permit to work on Sundays. She buys her merchandise from distributors located in the cities of Santiago and Valpara\u00edso.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy new clothing for babies, as well as items for New Year's celebrations, such as party supplies and shawls. Her goal for her business is to have an established location so that she can offer her merchandise more easily, since during the winter and summer seasons she is currently affected by the rain and sun.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Angelica lives with her mother, her sister, and her two year-old daughter. Her mother is currently suffering from a complex illness (a cervical tumor), which makes it hard for her to get around by herself. Another of Mar\u00eda Angelica's dreams is for her mother to recover, so she is doing everything she can to offer her mother more comfort and a better quality of life. Mar\u00eda Angelica also dreams of owning her own property, so she has already applied for a housing subsidy. Her family has had to have patience as they wait for the approval call. This has further motivated Mar\u00eda Angelica to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has offered her to invest in her business. In respect to her communal bank, Mar\u00eda Angelica comments that she has formed friendships and that despite some drawbacks, they have been able to succeed. She also has high expectations for the educational training sessions.\r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers northeast of Santiago. It is the regional capital and also the legislative seat of the country. It is the country's main port and offers a great variety of beautiful and picturesque sites, such as the home of Nobel Prize winning poet Pablo

Although he is 66 years old, he continues to be a very hard worker, and it was only last year that he started his own business. He sells the raw materials needed to make other products out of wood. But although Alfonso has an extensive network of clients who pay cash for his products, he has not been able to make much of a profit because his inventory is so small. It is for this reason that Alfonso is requesting a loan. He would like to increase the range of products he offers and thus, increase his sales. A loan would also help him improve the condition of his store, which is currently infested with insects that are ruining his wood and are obviously a very serious problem for the quality of his service. In these ways, capital would help him improve the profitability of his business and increase his household's income. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

She also sells food in the evenings from her house.\r\n\r\nSince Elba has been with Finca she has learned to schedule her payments and how to take her earnings and not touch her capital.\r\n\r\nElba needs a loan of 2,000 PEN to buy cosmetics, silver and gold jewelry, and a large grill.\r\n\r\nElba\u2019s dream is to expand her business and have a bazaar style store.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":356241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy cosmetics, silver and gold jewelry, and a large grill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-07-22T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":341.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596986},{"amount":112.61,"local_amount":333.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":341.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032377},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-26T09:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":341.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96944653},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":341.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103786599},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:03:12Z","rounded_local_amount":341.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677208},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-17T09:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":341.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110677209}],"funded_date":"2009-07-27T21:39:29Z","paid_date":"2010-01-17T09:37:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":127920,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena L. is a 54-year-old woman who lives in the town of Sataoa.

Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve their standard of living through the proceeds of the fishing and fish selling businesses she has established with the support of the loans she has requested.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s support of her business is Estelita\u2019s inspiration to keep going through the challenges of being poor but growing her business despite that. Over time, Estelita has been able to purchase a fishing boat for her husband to manage and use for fishing while she is the one who sells his fish directly to people in the market.\r\n\r\nThe fishing business has brought joy to Estelita\u2019s family, especially to her personally. Because of its profits, she has been able to graduate her eldest 23-year-old child from college. However, her second child has not graduated from college but, nevertheless, Estelita has accepted the fact that she can\u2019t have everything she has expected, especially with their poor economic status. Being a mother, she always wanted to support her son in whatever career he would be taking and that is being a fisherman just like his father.\r\n\r\nWith that, Estelita is requesting a loan from ASHI to be able to purchase another fishing boat for her son. This would not only provide him with employment but would also make their business grow and make more profit, which will enable her to support the education of her two youngest children to college level until they

Her husband is a merchant.  \r\n<p>\r\nCruz has a general store in her home where she sells all types of products such as rice, sugar, oil, detergents, and other items.  She works every day from 6am until 8pm, and sometimes much later.  Her children help with the business whenever they are not busy.  Even though her store is small, she says her customers can find whatever they need and do not plan to shop anywhere else.  Cruz has been in business for more than 10 years and has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to restock her store.  She will buy rice, sugar, oil, detergents, cured meats, and other basic necessities.  Cruz has been with the Communal Bank since the beginning and likes the fact that she has made many friends within her group.  Her goals are to continue with her business and expand it each day.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":804070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, sugar, oil, detergents, cured meats, and other basic necessities.

For this reason he decided to become independent and form his own business. At first he worked with his father for a laundry-mat, but over time he saw that having his own business would give him more earnings and this is why he came to be independent. He started a little laundry-mat and added a repair service since many of his clients come in to the store without hems on their pants. <p>\r\nNevertheless, each time more, his clients bring their clothes to him, and his few washing machines are insufficient to clean his orders with the rapidness that they deserve. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of $375 that he is willing to pay back in a period of five months. With this money Jorge will be able to buy a second-hand washer that will help him finish his orders in less time.

He dedicates himself to providing private taxi transportation, for which he relies on two taxis.  He drives one himself, and hires a second driver for the other.  The previous loans he requested served to help maintain his vehicles.  On this occasion, the loan would be used to build a retaining wall for his home since, during the rainy seasons we are experiencing in the country there exists the risk of collapses.  This is particularly true in the zone in which he lives which is on a mountainside.  His wife supports him through the sale of jewelry and by caring for their school-aged children.

This is 41-year-old Olipa M. from Tukuyu. She is divorced with three children between the ages of 13 and 25. Olipa has been running a bar since 2004. Her bar is a good place to chill with a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. It\u2019s the kind of place where you kick back on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand, the aroma of roasting \u2018mishikaki\u2019  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to anyone and everyone who happens to wander by. <p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Two employees assist her. Olipa currently earns about 200USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase more crates of beer, soft drinks, and other drinks, like whisky, for her business. In the future, she plans to open the same business in a new location. Olipa thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more crates of beer, soft drinks, and other drinks for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T07:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olipa A.

life, ensuring that they are free from poverty. She is married to Eduardo M., who worked as a laborer in a sugarcane plantation. They have eight children: six of them already have their own families and only two still live at home. The family lives in the village of Brgy. San Juan, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore she went into business, Erlinda also worked in the sugarcane plantation with her husband so that they could earn enough to feed their family of ten. But working in the sugarcane fields is very hard work, with long hours for very low wages and few benefits, and it took her away from home leaving her children to fend for themselves. Watching her children grow, Erlinda thought about their future and realized that if the family did not earn more income, she and her husband could never afford to send the children to school and provide them with a better future. This is why she decided to put up a small general store next to her house, using some of her salary from the sugarcane plantation. However, because her capital was very limited, she could only sell a few products. \r\n<p>\r\nTo access more capital, Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, and she immediately saw the impact of the additional 3,000 pesos she received from her first loan. She was able to buy more goods to sell and she noticed that the inventory turnover was faster, and she was able to earn more profits. So, as her income improved and NWTF-Project Dungganon allowed her to borrow larger amounts based on the cash flow estimates she presented in her proposal, she was able to expand her general store. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 15,000 pesos was her twelfth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was able to pay off each weekly installment on time, and fully repaid the loan within the loan term. It earned her an average monthly income of 3,000 pesos. For her thirteenth loan cycle, she is asking to borrow another 15,000 pesos to use as working capital for her general store so that she can continue improving the life of her family.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":391095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Y. is from the village of Polo.

Rosevilla has been engaged in her business for over 17 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Rosevilla joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase farm supplies and materials to manufacture nipa hut products. Rosevilla is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to manufacture nipa hut products. This loan will be her eighth from PMPC, and this is the second time she is being published in Kiva.

Esta es la segunda vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP y est\u00e1 feliz de seguir siendo parte integrante de su grupo comunal, donde las personas son bastante unidas. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, comprar\u00e1 productos comestibles y de primera necesidad para surtir mejor su tienda.\n\n","en":"Jessica is 35 years old.  She lives in her own house with her one year old son, Alexander, and her life partner, 30 year old Denis.  They both work with great care looking to improve their economic situation.\r\n\r\nShe has had a business selling food for four years.  It is in a space in her house.  She is able to sell everything that comes into her hands because she is a good merchant.  She offers her products in a pleasant manner.\r\n\r\nShe has also been growing citrus fruits and bananas for two years.  She has occasional help from her husband.  He works in a mining settlement, which is located in the city of Yurinaki.  \r\n\r\nAs her store is the first to open its door to customers her work begins at four in the morning.  The men from the fields leave for their farms at this hour.  What she likes best is that her grocery store is always stocked with local food products.  The earnings allow her to cover the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAt the moment she is saving for later on.  She plans to build a house in the city of Santa Ana or La Merced in order to set up a store where she can sell wholesale and retail.  She also plans to renovate her banana fields.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She is happy to continue being a member of her communal bank where the people are very supportive.

Primary School, Kathanthabana village, eight miles from Makeni. R.C. Primary School was founded in 1964 by the R.C. Mission. R.C. Primary school is staffed with ten teachers and  has185 pupils. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nJoseph S. K. (pictured here) is the head teacher and leader of this group. The 52-year-old Joseph was born in Binkolo village, about six miles from Makeni. He has been in the teaching profession for sixteen years now. He is married to a teacher and the couple has seven children \u2013 two in primary school and five in secondary school. \r\n\r\nMr. K. backs up his teaching income with agriculture. He has been an agriculturist for seven years now.  He will use part of his loan to pay school fees for his children and invest the rest in agriculture.

She used her first loan of 3,000 PHP to buy two piglets and this is how she started her hog-raising business.

Now she is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP to buy feed feed and vitamins for her hogs. She hopes to make a concrete piggery for her pigs.

Today, Ana Luisa is requesting a new loan - her seventh loan to date -- from Kiva and Esperanza International so she can buy more merchandise, including onions, eggplant, potatoes, salami, chicken, and used men's and women's clothing, for her store. When her loan is funded, Ana Luisa will travel by bus and\/or motorcycle taxi to La Romana, the closest big city, to buy the used clothing for her business, and she will go out further into the countryside to buy her produce from local farmers. \r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa's independent business is certainly a success story in its own right. She has been able to expand her business steadily over time, and she owns one of the most vibrant home enterprises in the La Gina batey. For example, the loan she will take out today is over twice the size of her very first loan, and she has expanded her merchandise offerings from chicken and used clothing to a whole variety of food and clothing goods. This is no small feat, considering that bateys are often the most economically stagnant communities in the Dominican Republic. Geographically isolated, and populated mostly by Dominicans of Haitian descent, who face the greatest difficulties in securing citizenship rights, starting and expanding a business in a rural batey is no easy task. Furthermore, it is especially impressive that Ana Luisa is able to take out a loan of this size at this time of the year, since commercial activity in the batey generally slows down considerably during the sugarcane off-season.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa uses the revenues from her business to help support her three grandchildren who live with her and her husband. She helps to pay for their school uniforms and school supplies, and she hopes that her business will continue to fund their education in the future. Ana Luisa has six grown children of her own and 25 grandchildren!<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa appears in the center of the photograph with her four fellow group members of the Pasos Firmes (Solid Steps)

She is married and has four young children. To make a living, Malagaleupolu operates a business selling agricultural equipment. The main source of income for the business comes from selling plant seedlings and young crops to local farmers. Malagaleupolu has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 350 Samoa Tala (about $132) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malagaleupolu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Malagaleupolu is requesting a loan from SPBD of 750 WST, which will be used to purchase general agricultural supplies and equipment. This will be the first loan she has taken out from SPBD.  Malagaleupolu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":366842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He has been a farmer since he was very young and has sold animals for the past three years.  He owns 0.25 hectares of arable land and he tends to lease a second plot of the same size to grow corn.  In addition, he buys and raises small farm animals (goats, lambs, ducks) which he raises and then sells to neighbors who, in turn, sell them in the city of Chiclayo and on the border with Ecuador.  This is the family's main source of income.\r\n\r\nA short time ago he harvested his corn crop but neglected the animal raising side of his business.  The small profits he got from his crops he intends to reinvest in his next planting but he must not continue to neglect his main source of family income.  For this reason, he has seen the need, for the first time, to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan.  He is asking for 1000 new soles to buy animals to continue to raise them for sale.  \r\n\r\nHis greatest wish is to build a house of substantial materials.

Romero is a young 22 year old woman who lives with her mother in a community called Ca\u00f1o Negro, located in Los Chiles, in the province of Alajuela.  This community is distinctive for being mountainous, and for being very close to the northern frontier of our country.  Its principal economic activities are livestock and agriculture, specifically the growth of basic grains, sugarcane, and oranges.\r\n\r\nSince Mayra finished high school, she worked helping her mother with household chores, as she had not yet found a job.  Thanks to the development of sustainable tourism in the area where she lives, various hotels opened that needed staff.  Thanks to the English that she learned in high school, today she is working as a receptionist in the Hotel Natural Lodge.  With this work, she has been able to improve the lives of her family and herself.\r\n\r\nDue to her schedule and the distance from her house, she has to walk alone from the place where the bus lets her off to her house at all hours of the night.  It is for this reason that she is asking for a loan of \u00a2666,000 (six hundred and sixty-six thousand colones) for the purchase of a motorcycle so she can transport herself to the hotel and so continue with her job. \r\n\r\nMayra is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Emcrecoba, one of the 100 member organizations belonging to EDESA in Costa Rica.  This would be her first loan.  However, she emphasizes that thanks to this type of organization and related credit facilitations, many people without sufficient resources can reach their dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

In the future, Shanta plans to boost the economic condition of her family and she thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

I. is 46 years old, has completed high school, is married, has five children. Alimahmad is planning to use his loan to buy cattle and feed for fattening. Mr. I. has been doing this type of activity for the last 13 years. After completing fattening he will sell the cattle every 40-45 days and use the money he makes from sales to purchase more animals. The main buyers of his cattle are the citizens of the city Kurgan-Tyube and surrounding regions. This type of activity is the main source of income for the family.

She is a hardworking woman, 62 years old, a widow with three grandchilren between the ages of 12 and 15. All of them are in school, and she is their guardian.\r\n\r\nCufamune went to school until 4th grade, when she had to stop because of political turmoil during Portuguese colonial rule of the country.\r\n\r\nShe left Macia in 1966, going by herself to Boane, where she later married her late husband. She lives in her own house.\r\n\r\nShe's been a shopkeeper for some time and sells secondhand clothing. She learned business 23 years ago and the most popular products are men's suits, which she sells for 1800 meticals each. She acquires her goods in the city of Maputo at affordable prices. She uses her earnings to cover family expenses, including supporting her sister, who lives far away.\r\n\r\nShe's never received loans from other banks, and this is her second loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 25,000 meticals. She intends to use the loan to increase her sales and satisfy the demand for products during this winter season.\r\n\r\nShe used her first loan of 15,000 meticals for the same purpose. She learned about Hluvuku through friends and residents of Boane.\r\n\r\nShe intends to pay off her loan in full and on time, and to request new loans so she can begin selling products wholesale.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

They operated a small restaurant in which they sold a variety of foods. When her husband died, however, things went downhill; nothing was the same, and the restaurant eventually closed. Mercedes has four children who are working, and they help her to pay her basic costs such as food and home repair. They work cultivating land in the rural areas of the Department of Matagalpa, where coffee, rice and beans are grown, among other basic staples. Mercedes is now dedicating herself to the needs of her home; she has worked with Afodenic during nine loan cycles to improve her business. With this loan, she wants to change the doors at the front of her house to improve security, since the wood has rotted and they need to be replaced. With her children's help, she will continue to make progress and cover her needs. Her goal is to reopen her business, and with the financing she hopes to achieve this; she is just giving herself a little time to get started. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia

 His two children are 11 and 13 years old and both attend local secondary schools.  His wife is a construction worker and usually travels to various construction sites outside the town.  Turbat usually takes care of his two children and is responsible for family duties.
