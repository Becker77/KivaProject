This leads to poor financial support and therefore poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Some of them will use their loan to begin or continue building a house; others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education.

She began a business in 1984 with an initial capital of US$ 50. Between 1984 and 1990, the sale of fresh foodstuffs brought her up to a capital of US$ 100, which allowed her to diversify her business by adding on a general store. This also prospered from 1994 to 2000, at which point Chantal was in a traffic accident as she was out buying goods for her store. Her hospitalization of 4 months caused a noticeable diminishing of her business. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter her convalescence, in 2000, she decided to undertake a different type of business, selling beauty products for women. Since she had acquired so much experience in business management over the years, Chantal was able to accumulate a personal capital of US$ 500 by 2006, which allowed her to open a little factory for pure drinking water that she maintains up to today.<P>\r\n\r\nIn view of her  dream of one day opening a big factory making drinking water so as to serve the population of her neighborhood, which has great need of this product, she decided in December of 2007 to join one of the groups of Hope RDC called \u00ab R\u00e9hoboth Plus \u00bb with the goal of increasing her business's financial base. Chantal is a faithful client of Hope and has received several loans, reimbursing them completely and in a timely manner. <P>\r\n\r\nThe loan she has received in this month of June allowed her to buy 1000 packages of bags of pure water so as to satisfy the needs of her customers and thus increase her profit. Presently, her personal capital is more than US$ 500. Her business generates $40 in profit per week. Chantal is a 41-year-old woman, married and the mother of 12 children  from 4 to 24 years of age. Eleven of them are enrolled in school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":332186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of 1000 packages of bags of water for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has five independent children, and she lives alone in the La Ladrillera sector of the Cayalt\u00ed district.  It is one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has had a small convenience store set up in her home for six years.  She tells us that she was able to set it up with the savings from her activity of selling animals.  In her business she sells basic needs products (rice, sugar, oil), groceries, and drinks to her neighbors.  She also sells food in the city market on Tuesdays.\r\n\r\nThis business is very useful to the neighbors in the area because it provides them with articles for daily use.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located in the state of Mexico and has 11 members.  One of the members is Mrs Yuriana A. R. who is 29 years old.  She has been married to Mr Fidel A. Medina, an agricultural worker, for 5 years.  Her husband grows and sells corn.  She has a small fruit and vegetable store and tells us that she decided to set up her business because her husband's income often didn't manage to cover their needs and those of their two children.  When she started in her business she sold in the street from a very small stall and kept her merchandise in her apartment.  She only sold beans and corn since her husband is an agricultural worker and the corn was from his harvests.  After a while, she also began to sell peas and, little by little, her business started to prosper.  She managed to rent premises and began to sell more vegetables.  She would like to use her loan to buy fruit and grow her business.  She believes that in this way her income will increase and she will have the opportunity to give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn this same group is Mrs Isabel V..  She is 31 years old and has a dressmaking workshop which she has had for 10 years.  She tells us that since she was 11 years old her parents taught her how to sew since sewing is the main economic activity in their region.  She is alone with her three children.  She began her business with one machine and only sold in the small square in her town each week.  She then began to sew sweatshirts and bermuda shorts.  She started selling in more town squares and, even better, she began to sell her garments to order.  She would like this loan to buy a better variety of fabric so that her business can continue to grow.  Her oldest son is barely 14 years old yet he already dreams of becoming an excellent lawyer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":636170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

For this reason, she decided to request a loan from Ceprodel in order to fulfil her need and to buy vegetables, meat, chicken, rice, oil, sodas and candies to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":772047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables, meat, chicken, soda, rice, oil, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ligia Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":573},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":784.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":801.1},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":832.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":851.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":878.14},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":912.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":964.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":983.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.79,"local_amount":573,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":574.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221639191},{"amount":33.73,"local_amount":749.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T07:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":751.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227007422},{"amount":35.78,"local_amount":795.16,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":797.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232766678},{"amount":37.95,"local_amount":843.42,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":845.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238573799},{"amount":39.14,"local_amount":869.87,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":872.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244531738},{"amount":38.9,"local_amount":864.51,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-28T08:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":866.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250741080},{"amount":39.03,"local_amount":867.35,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-13T07:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":869.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257148186},{"amount":199.68,"local_amount":4437.06,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-21T07:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4449.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263278877}],"funded_date":"2011-05-27T03:00:29Z","paid_date":"2012-04-21T07:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":303518,"name":"Judas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judas is 38 years old and married with four children ages 13-4 years.

Later, she started selling eggs. Eventually, she opened a storefront and has been continuing to slowly expand her business. Lourdes reports that her sales are currently down due to school vacations but she has a good business because she has the only store on the block.\r\n\r\nLourdes is requesting a loan to stock her store with rice, sugar, noodles, lentils, toilet paper, and soft drinks and to purchase ceramics to paint. This will be her first loan. In the past, she was afraid to put herself in debt. Now, as her businesses have grown, she is confident she can repay her loan. Lourdes believes this loan will help her move forward with her children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet and New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Commerce has been her primary source of support.  When her small son arrived 12 years ago, she had to choose work that would allow her to spend more time at home taking care of him and helping him with his homework and education.  That is why she started to sell clothes at home.  She visits the homes of her friends and neighbors to offer different articles of clothing that she buys in one of the most well known commercial centers in Lima, which is in the center of the city.  Susana sells at low prices, and that is why she has a lot of customers.  Through her work efforts she has been able to buy two \u201cmotocarros\u201d (three wheeled motorized cart).  She rents them out by the day, which gives her extra income.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, Susana would like to have a clothing store in her house so that she would not have to walk so much.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  She is very happy with her supportive group.  The members are very punctual, and they are all good friends.  The money will be used to buy more clothes in order to increase her sales and earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":362502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-04T15:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":158.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":173.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":178.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":189.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":199.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":204.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.6,"local_amount":131.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":134.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081119},{"amount":53.91,"local_amount":158.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":162.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997269},{"amount":55.76,"local_amount":164.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":167.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842613},{"amount":213.12,"local_amount":628.14,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":640.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734189},{"amount":38.19,"local_amount":112.54,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":114.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992359},{"amount":69.42,"local_amount":204.62,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":208.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717192}],"funded_date":"2009-08-04T23:52:41Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":130596,"name":"Vian John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vian John Q. is from the village of Kinangay Sur, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

He lives with his wife and two children and is the sole income provider for his family. He has been running a bakery since 1995. Throughout Lebanon it is common to find small bakeries with delicious bread, pastries, and \u201cmanouche\u201d, a type of Lebanese pizza. The borrower is requesting a loan of $1200 from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l. He plans to use the loan to invest in a new machine for mixing dough. This will be his first loan from Ameen. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).

She is 24 and single. Like Chynygul, she works at village administration. She also needs a cell phone. She applied for a loan in order to buy a cell phone which will move her to a new level of communication with her relatives, friends, and colleagues. As she receives her wages, she will gradually repay her loan.\r\n<p>\r\nKanatbek M. is 28 and married. He has two children, a four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son. His wife is a housewife. Two years ago, he decided to start cattle breeding with an initial investment of 2,000 soms. For now, he receives 1,500 soms monthly, but he plans to increase the number of cattle and, as a result, increase profits from cattle breeding. Also, cattle breeding helped him to buy his car, a Daewoo Tico. In order to increase the number of cattle, he needs to buy more heads of cattle. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have enough funds. Thus, he is applying for a loan. With the profit from cattle breeding, he plans to increase the number of cattle. \r\n<p>\r\nGulhan T. is 58 and married. She has five children. Her sons are 33 and 26, and her daughters are 37, 36, and 29. Her daughters are married and live independently. Her first son is a teacher at a college, and her second son is in Russia. Her husband is a pensioner, while she breeds cattle with the help of her first son. Six years ago she decided to buy a cow because, in her opinion, it was safer than just holding money. After that, she decided to breed cattle. Now, they have 25 heads of cattle, which they will fatten and sell. With the profit from cattle breeding, she could buy a car for her son and make capital repairs to her house. Starting her business with 2,000 soms, she now makes 20,000 soms monthly. She is applying for a loan in order to buy two goats, fatten them, and resell them in the future at a higher price. With the profit from cattle breeding, she plans to buy a truck for transportation of cattle. \r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious, and socially focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Y como tiene muchos planes, para el futuro tiene el anhelo de instalar un restaurante en su zona, donde ofrecer\u00e1 sus mejores platillos, de esta manera espera seguir progresando. Es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues esta muy agradecida con todas las personas que hicieron posible este aporte que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Evarista tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de ingredientes, al por mayor, que le hacen falta para continuar preparando sus platillos en mayor cantidad, de esta manera espera seguir progresando. \n\n","en":"Evarista is 50 years old and lives alone in her own home, as her children now have their own families and they come to visit from time to time.  For the last 4 years this enterprising woman has sold food in a local market.  Every day she wakes up very early to start cooking, for by noon she must have available 30 meals, which she offers to her regular diners.  She likes her work a lot, for it keeps her busy and generates regular earnings, which allow her to live comfortably.  What she doesn\u2019t like is that when she offers meals on credit, some diners fall behind in paying punctually, and this slows down her revenue.  She sells her meals from 12 noon to 2 in the afternoon, and then rests from her work.  She has many plans, such as for the future she would like to set up a restaurant in the area, where she will offer her best meals.  She hopes thereby to continue to grow.  This is the second loan she will have with MFP, and she promises to pay the installments promptly, for she is very grateful to all those who have made this support possible, which will enable her to keep working and moving forward.  Evarista plans to use the requested loan to buy wholesale the commodities needed to continue preparing her meals in larger quantities.  She thus hopes to keep on making progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":666318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy commodities wholesale, and avoid problems when preparing her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-17T19:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evarista ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":67.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":78.95},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90.52},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":96.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":99.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":67.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463644},{"amount":26.29,"local_amount":70.1,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887024},{"amount":28.38,"local_amount":75.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":79.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327383},{"amount":28.27,"local_amount":75.38,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":79.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195944},{"amount":29.61,"local_amount":78.95,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269624},{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":80.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":85.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549616},{"amount":31.36,"local_amount":83.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":88.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718350},{"amount":32.44,"local_amount":86.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349916},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":91.32,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850495},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":93.7,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":99.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665746},{"amount":73.53,"local_amount":196.09,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":207.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620945}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T19:45:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":262554,"name":"Tim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tim S. is a 54-year-old widower and is blessed with seven children; three are single and four are married.

","en":"22-year-old Aura Lila is a single mother who has a three-year-old son.  She lives in Guisquiliapa.  Aura Lila makes tortillas, nacatamales (Nicaraguan tamales) and corn-based products.  She has been in this business for five years and started out in the business because her mother pushed her to make her own income from a young age.  Her mother taught her how to make tortillas and, before that, she used to go out and sell them.\r\n\r\nAnother member of this group is Dora Elizabeth who is 24 years old and married.  Her business is making tortillas.  She also sells baked beans and  other corn-based products such as 'tortilla dulce' (sweet tortillas) etc.  She started her business because of the lack of work that plagues her country.  She had to find a way of making her own income in order to support her household.

When she was nine years old she learned the profession of making hammocks.  Her mother was the one who taught her this craft, which has been generational.  Her grandmother taught her mother, and her mother taught her daughters.  All of them have their own business making hammocks, and it is their source of income.\r\n\r\nShe makes the hammocks at her house.  In order to do this she needs to go to the city once a week to buy the materials she needs.  She leaves her house at 5:00 in the morning headed towards town.  This is due to the fact that Maria lives on a hill, and she walks a half an hour to get to the route where she takes the bus that takes her to town.  At 7:30 a.m. she is preparing the pita fiber (material for making hammocks) in order to turn it into the rope.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to increase and improve her production.  That is why she is requesting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo.  She will use the loan to buy a greater quantity of materials.  One thing she will buy is the pita.  It is more expensive and more sought-after, and the hammocks sell more quickly.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will be purchasing better quality materials to make the hammocks softer, which make them more sellable.  This will allow her to increase her income and at the same type satisfy her customers\u2019 demand.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to make her house bigger and to build it from concrete blocks.  Her children are growing and need space.  Five people live in the house, therefore the space for making the hammocks is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":879905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make her hammocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-09-28T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":31.82,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":31.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238807070},{"amount":32,"local_amount":32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562701},{"amount":32.47,"local_amount":32.47,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":32.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773825},{"amount":33.17,"local_amount":33.17,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":33.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317355},{"amount":31.99,"local_amount":31.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":31.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033047},{"amount":33.49,"local_amount":33.49,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":33.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645267},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":27.19,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491720},{"amount":55.02,"local_amount":55.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":55.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736274},{"amount":37.14,"local_amount":37.14,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":37.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561564},{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":85.71,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399827}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T01:08:22Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":344535,"name":"Dinara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinara is 44 years old and is married to a security guard.

She works with great effort for them and wants to continue to do so to build a prominent and promising future. Ever since she was a little girl, she has been dedicated to farming activities. She was raised this way and it has been a stable source of income until this day.<P>\r\n\r\nFor more than 11 years, Mutabar together with her husband has been raising sheep and also growing some crops on their land. To continue to work and to obtain a very good quantity and quality, Mutabar wants to borrow money for growing hay and other feed for his sheep on his land. For that she needs to purchase seeds and fertilizer. Let\u2019s show solidarity to this selfless mother who looks for what is best for her children. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She supplies herself from rural producers in the towns near Sikasso and then sells the goods retail, cash or credit accepted, in Ni\u00e8na and in mining zones.

Mely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for additional working capital. Mely is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase kerosene, and as working capital. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Mely from PMPC.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":431596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials  in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757764},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146858},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123985003},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015676},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740682},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773796}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T04:23:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":159500,"name":"Gotitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco D.

Vilma has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Vilma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional stocks of firewood and bananas. This loan will be the first taken out by Vilma from HSPFI.

With this loan, Josephine will feel comfortable and happy as it will promote both her business and her self esteem, she told me."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":312903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-04-30T17:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":428571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":428571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":428571.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":428571.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":428571.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":428571.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":428571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.28},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":139.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":163.66,"local_amount":503571,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":512257.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611669},{"amount":163.66,"local_amount":503571,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":512257.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008610},{"amount":90.54,"local_amount":278572.29,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":283377.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230955},{"amount":139.28,"local_amount":428571.43,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":435964.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662635},{"amount":139.29,"local_amount":428571.43,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":435964.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102961},{"amount":139.28,"local_amount":428571.43,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":435964.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019973},{"amount":139.29,"local_amount":428571.42,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":435964.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864818}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T03:54:50Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":110133,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maribel tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es una madre alegre y din\u00e1mica en cada uno de sus trabajos, vive con su pareja y padre de sus hijos en su casa propia. Fue campesina desde ni\u00f1a, por ello que le tiene un gran cari\u00f1o a cada uno de sus cultivos, los cuales orgullosamente muestra, y para la foto sostiene los bulbitos secos de la flor llamada gladiolo. Generalmente se dedica al cultivo de flores porque le generan mayores ingresos, con el apoyo de su esposo trabaja muy duro diariamente para lograr cosechar en grandes cantidad y de buen tama\u00f1o para que tenga un mejor precio en el mercado. Sus labores en el campo son muy duras y pesadas; pero ello no le ha quitado la alegr\u00eda, y siempre tiene una sonrisa que brindar. Para el futuro, Maribel se proyecta a sembrar en mayores cantidades, aunque su dificultad mayor es el costo elevado de los fertilizantes, ya que sin ellos sus productos no se desarrollan bien.

She lives with her husband and children in their own house.  She has been a farmer since she was a child, and that is why she is very fond of all of her crops, which she proudly shows; in the photo she is holding the dried bulbs of the gladiolus flower.  Maribel generally makes a living growing flowers, since they generate the most income.  With her husband\u2019s help she works very hard each day looking after their great quantity of large-sized crops, which will fetch a better price at the market.  Her work in the field is very hard and tiring, but it continues to be enjoyable, and she always has a smile when she works.  In the future Maribel is planning to plant larger amounts of crops, though the biggest problem is the high cost of fertilizer, since without it her crops will not grow well.  This is her 4th loan with Kiva partner MFP, though her colleagues at the communal bank are already in their 5th loan cycle because she joined the group during its 2nd loan cycle; she is very pleased with everyone\u2019s work.  The money that Maribel is requesting is for purchasing chemical fertilizer.  She will use it to fertilize the field where she grows potatoes and flowers, which she will plant in the coming days.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":323146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-25T05:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":831.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996789}],"funded_date":"2009-05-25T05:24:05Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":114229,"name":"Edwin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edwin trabaja como transportista en el trufi 88 del Sindicato Eduardo Avaroa tiene su movilidad propia, la cual es su principal fuente de ingreso con la que cubre la manutenci\u00f3n de sus tres hijos; la esposa se encuentra trabajando en la Republica de Argentina como costurera..\n\nVive en la casa de sus padres ubicado en la Zona Villa Alpacoma de la Ciudad de El Alto.\n\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo destinar\u00e1 para comprar un motor m\u00e1s nuevo para movilidad.\n \nEs el primer cr\u00e9dito con Impro, la evaluaci\u00f3n realizada permite la aprobaci\u00f3n del   pr\u00e9stamo solicitado por el prestatario.\n","en":"Edwin works as a driver in the \u201ctrufi\u201d (a taxi with a fixed route) 88 in the Sindicato Eduardo Avaroa.

D. has a pulper\u00eda (a small general store in her home) called \"ALEXANDER\".   She lives with her partner and is the mother of 4 children ages 10 to 5 years old, two of whom are in elementary school and one who is in middle school.  Her companion is a farmer who plants basic grains.  His specialty is growing corn and beans.  Mirna established this business on her own because she was only taking care of children and their economic situation was not very good since her partner was 100 percent responsible for the household expenses.  Now, with her business, their situation has improved a lot and she contributes for food and covers some of the bills when she can.\r\n\r\nMr. Santos Isidro V. buys and sells pigs.  He is also a farmer who grows basic grains like corn and beans.  Mr. Santos leaves the town of Sta. Maria to buy his pigs and then brings them back to his home in a herd.  A few days later a buyer comes and he sells the animals.  Mr. Santos lives with his partner and doesn\u2019t have any children.  He only has a brother-in-law who relies on them because he lives with them due to illness.  Mr. Santos is a person who is well known in Sta. Maria because of his business and also because he\u2019s lived in this town for more than 30 years.  \r\n\r\nMr. JOSE FERMIN B. P. is in sales.  He mostly sells plastics, rubber sandals, fruits and vegetables.  He used to live in the capital, but because of marital problems he separated from his wife and came to live on the land he is from to raise two of his three children.  Mr. Jos\u00e9, is a man who struggles so he can educate his children who are in elementary school right now.  Mr. B. buys plastic products and sandals in the capital and then sells them in communities and by coffee plantations near Sta. Mar\u00eda.  He has a car, so when he sells in coffee plantation areas he buys plantains and bananas and then sells them in the capital where he can get better prices since he\u2019s doing two businesses in only one trip. \r\n\r\nAll of these people need a loan so they can get ahead. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":412817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sugar, TP, rice, lard, soap, pasta, milk, flour, eggs, coffee, cookies, bread, pigs, plastic utencil, fruits and veggies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-10-23T20:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirna Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Isidoro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Fermin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":177.78,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3364.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863391},{"amount":177.78,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3364.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753076},{"amount":88.89,"local_amount":1666.69,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142132},{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:09:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123979537},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2523.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010531},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2523.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734898}],"funded_date":"2009-10-24T17:40:34Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":151230,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisca S. is from the village of Baybay, Panalsalan.

For the last 14 years she has been an employee of the Ministry of Education as an  elementary school teacher at the Puertas Rojas School in Acoyapa.  She must get up very early every day to ride her bicycle to work at the little school where she teaches the children of the area.  She is asking for her 8th loan to improve her house by building a front wall to replace the damaged one there now as well as to buy the door and windows.  She hopes, thereby, to provide better security to her home.  She says that the loans that AFODENIC has provided have allowed her to have a better house and now she hopes to be a beneficiary of Kiva Fund.   Her greatest wish is that her children study and have a university career that will allow them to have a better quality of life and to continue improving her house, which is the asset she means to leave her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

He has his own business in which he manufactures and sells mattresses and pillows.  His business has been in operation for 14 years, but he is currently experiencing difficulties as a result of low sales.  The financial situation of his clients has caused them to reduce their payments.  \r\n<p>\r\nCandido plans short-term improvements, such as establishing a mini-warehouse in his home for storing materials.  The loan he is requesting will be used to buy raw materials such as fabrics, straps, sponges, and nylon.  Don Candido has two assistants, so he is contributing to society and helping to reduce unemployment in the country.  He is not the only person who benefited from the help of the Institution, but other people as well by providing them job security.  Candido is very happy to have this opportunity and for the confidence placed in him by the Institution to increase his mattress sales.  He is thankful for this financial investment to help him stabilize his small business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marilyn provides manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the first loan taken out by Marilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Arlyn is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan she has taken out from HSPFI.

She lives with her spouse and they have three schoolage children together. They live together in the community of Santa Rosa, where they have their own house made of wood. Despite not having finished primary school,  Katiuska was undaunted by the adversity in her path. She summoned the necessary strength to start her own business, specifically in agriculture.  Today she produces and sells considerable amounts of cacao to her biggest customers. This brings her good income, due to the timely delivery to each of her customers. Normally, she works with her spouse, but at harvest and planting time she hires farmhands so that it is easier to extract the cacao product and then sell it in the stockpiling centers of her community. Her plan for the future is to expand to other areas. For this she will look for new cropland in strategic areas with the purpose of minimizing time and cost.  This is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to making the payments according to schedule. She is also happy with her communal bank, since it has been very beneficial.

He is married and has one son and one daughter. He has a barber shop and wants to purchase a new barber kit and some barber products such as hair products and shaving products, etc., in order to improve his work. He has some money but it is not enough to purchase the supplies so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Alaa gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase new barber kit and other essential products to improve his work. This will increase his income and enable him to provide better life conditions to the family. Alaa' is photographed in his barber shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

I now live in Vehari with my husband. I have nine children and all my sons are currently working as laborers. One of my daughters sews cloth for the neighbors. I am a housewife and am not allowed to work outside my home because I live in a community where it is not considered acceptable. Last year one of my sons, Ali Raza, started a pan (beetle nut) shop. His business did not do too well and he had to close it down due to lack of working capital. Next he started working in a jewelry shop and is doing well. Now he wants to start his own business purchasing jewelry from Lahore and selling for profit in Vehari. He has experience in the business and I think he would do well. For this purpose, he needs a loan of $250 to start his business successfully."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":71186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"open a jewellery shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Vehari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.033333 72.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2007-10-02T23:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Razia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-17T00:39:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:25:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82849},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:28:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98546},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117238},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137217},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159968},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184838},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212479},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:59:02Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240594},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-07-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269517},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-08-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298656},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-09-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":329248},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2008-10-17T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-25T07:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":363263}],"funded_date":"2007-10-03T00:39:39Z","paid_date":"2008-10-25T07:05:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24110,"name":"Eldar","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Mr Eldar lives in the city of Saatli in Azerbaidjan. He is 54, married and has 4 children. Eldar is the only breadwinner for the family. He earns money by raising cattle and selling it on the local market. Each year he buys young calves from nearby farmers and neighboring villages and raises them for 8 to 9 months on his property. When they are all grown up, Eldar sells them to the local butcher shops. Currently Eldar is thinking about increasing the size of his business because current income is insufficient to provide for his four children. He is planing to purchase 2 more calves than usual. In order to be able to do that he requires an additional $500.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since she was 18 years old, she has dedicated herself to sowing and selling coffee and plantains.  She inherited this business from her parents, which pleases her very much.  For this reason, she gets up every day so that at 7:00 am, with lunch prepared, she goes to her small farms.  Sometimes she goes with her husband, but generally, she does it alone since her husband works as a plumber.

This makes for a very special social composition since the inhabitants are a mixture of people from all over the country who come to work in their own business or in the Malambo Industrial Park (PIMSA), a private industrial complex complete with infrastructure services and designed to reduce business expenses for those set up there, along with guaranteeing the availability of sufficient labor. This is where Darinel moved his business, where he sells grocery items, especially a refreshment called \"Raspado\", a cold snack consisting of shaved ice from a manual machine topped with tropical fruit syrups like lime, tamarind, cola and cherry and then covered with condensed milk. It's a very refreshing drink to quench the thirst that the Caribbean climate produces. Commerce has been Darniel's day-to-day activity since he was very little. When he was 10 he sold treats that his grandmother made, and then he made a living selling fish before he set up his own sales post selling vegetables. Later on he started frying the vegetables working alongside his wife until between the two of them they were able to save enough to buy a refrigerator and obtain a loan to start their own store.

They do not own their own house and so live with their in-laws and share the household expenses.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Hilda takes care of her children at home as they are still small and this gives her the opportunity of raising chickens.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the communal bank and with it she is going to purchase chickens and chicken feed.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have her own house. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":880474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and chicken feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-09-28T08:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238609207},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563476},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774452},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182833},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318066},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033392}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T14:05:38Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":344583,"name":"Mostafa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mostafa is a 28-year-old man, who is married and has four sons and one daughter. He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a modest salary. Mostafa wants to improve his income by purchasing a new rickshaw to drive and take internal transports, but the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Mostafa gets the loan which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to complete the amount he has and purchase a new rickshaw, that will enable him to work extra and increase his income and so provide better living conditions to his family. Mostafa is photographed in the picture next to the rickshaw he will buy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Imperial, with its sandy beaches, pre-Incan ruins and production of Peru's beloved national liquor, el Pisco (a type of liquor made from grapes), has long been a tourist destination for well-heeled Peruvians. But the true Imperial is a warm, peaceful city with a large Afro-Peruvian population, the result of an indigenous history and the influence of Spanish imperialism. The city, along with others near the Pacific coast, was damaged in the 2001 and 2007 earthquakes in Peru, but has born up as it has throughout most of its history.

My husband and I are under a great deal of stress as we have nine children to feed, clothe and educate. My two elder sons work and my daughter stays at home as we cannot afford to send them all to school. \r\n\r\nI stay at home to take care of the children now. I used to sell some fruits and vegetables in my neighborhood, but that was unprofitable as neighbors liked to buy things on credit, which led to bad debt. My husband sells fruits and vegetables in the local market after purchasing them from nearby villages. Last year he was employed and made only $3 per day, but he has just set up his business. A $250 loan would help me and my husband to buy and sell more produce in the market and make $6 per day.
