Her husband Mateo G., 58 years old, helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 8 children who are 23 to  34 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorentina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her business and family. The accompanying photo of Florentina and her husband in their wooden boat was taken near the raft where they raise oysters. Florentina G. is a 'Dungganon' woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sergia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,900 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and expansion of her businesses. Sergia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has many years of experience in this business.    Sasauli needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets and knives. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sasauli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sasauli's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the last 8 years, she has been preparing and selling food. Some of the most popular are chicken and rice, noodles, fried rice and potatoes with Ocopa sauce (Peruvian dishes). These are what most of her customers like. Among them are athletes who play on the community sports fields, but on weekdays she sells mazamorra morada and rice pudding (Peruvian desserts).  What she likes the most about her work is that it is a calm activity and she does it with no rush and it is profitable. With this job, she can watch her grandson.

The group is comprised of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Socorro, who will use this loan to buy food for raising <i>mojarra<\/i> [a type of fish]; Ms. Mar\u00eda Fidela, who will buy pigs, sheep and bulls; Ms. Felipa and Ms. Mar\u00eda de la Luz, who will buy soap, sugar, milk and eggs; Ms. Patricia who will buy food for fattening her sheep; Ms. Mar\u00eda Mercedes who will buy pigs to fatten; and Ms. Virginia, who is going to buy vegetables and meat to make her tacos.\r\n\r\nVirgina is 51 years old and studied until the second year of primary school. She is married and has seven children, five of whom are grown up and working. Her two younger children are a 15 year-old boy who is in secondary school and a 9 year-old girl who attends primary school. Virginia sells steak, sausage and tripe tacos. She is requesting a loan to buy one burner, soft drinks, and vegetables and meat to prepare her tacos. She will also use part to install a floor where she sells her tacos.\r\n\r\nVirginia started her business 25 years ago because, with her husband out of work and her children still young, she lacked the necessary economic resources. She obtained a loan with her brother-in-law to put into her business and started to sell her tacos. Her business is important because it brings in profits when she's selling well. Virginia remembers once when her granddaughter was sick and she came up with 500 pesos to bring her to the doctor and to pay for her medicines. It was the profits from her business that made it possible for Virginia to pay.\r\n\r\nShe feels proud that the families who are her customers prefer her business and is proud when they say that her tacos are delicious. She reinvests her profits to buy ingredients to continue selling. Her daughter and her husband help her with the business, preparing and selling the tacos. Virginia's hopes and dreams are to make her business larger and for her youngest children to reach professional careers. She is happy to receive this loan because it's not just anywhere that you find people who help others unselfishly.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you very much for having confidence in us. We will not fail you, so that you will continue helping more people with their businesses and families.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Socorro is missing in the photograph above."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":840329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a burner, soft drinks, and vegetables and meat for preparing tacos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Fidela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201970},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807562},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618656},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572898}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T10:19:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":329800,"name":"Banco Comunal Tesoro De Dios Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco Comunal Tesoro De Dios est\u00e1 conformado por nueve integrantes que se dedican a diferentes actividades econ\u00f3micas, ellos formaron este grupo La representante es la se\u00f1ora Azucena De La Concepci\u00f3n de 63 a\u00f1os tiene 13 hijos que viven de manera independiente.

They named their group Cookery Women. This will be their fourth loan from SMT. Previous loans have made tremendous impacts in their lives. The last loan they received from Kiva through SMT was for Le 800,000.00 each. Now, they are requesting a loan of Le 1,000,000.00 for each to enable them to strengthen their businesses further.\n\nIsatu S. (2nd from left) is the leader of this group. Isatu is forty years of age. She was born in Kupr Kalisa, Kambia district, in the northern part of Sierra Leone. She now resides in Makeni City together with her husband. She has two children. One is in Senior Secondary School II (JSS II) and the other is in Class 2.  Her husband is a businessman. \n\nIsatu sells cooked rice and has been in this business for over eight years now. With this loan, Isatu will buy cooking ingredients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to com,munities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiusu T. She is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Naite owns and operates a handicraft business. She sells fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members. Naite has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\r\n\r\nNaite joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. This will be Naite's 4th loan from SPBD. She most recently repaid a loan of 2250 WST that she used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. She will use this loan of 2750 WST to purchase more raw materials and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n<br>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

They live in Salvadorita County in Puerto Principe, in the jurisdiction of Nueva Guinea. For 35 years, Wilfredo's main occupation has been farming and ranching. He is requesting his second loan with AFODENIC and hopes to receive benefits from the Kiva fund so that he can purchase two cows which have given birth. This will allow him to produce milk on his farm, sell dairy products, and improve his dairy herd, thus ensuring that his family unit will have sufficient food and income. Wilfredo's ranch offers good technical conditions for the development of this herd. In his community, Wilfredo is highly respected for his leadership. In the future, he hopes to improve the quality of life for his family and increase his inventory of livestock. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":491885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nueva Guinea, RAAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T04:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263227579}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T12:57:41Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:11:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":182219,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita is hopeful that, by starting a small business, she will be able to make a profit, which she can use to support some of her family's needs.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and a member of the GH Missimahou group of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

This is 36-year-old Fatuma H J. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children. Additionally, Fatuma has been running a charcoal business since 2002. She sells charcoal, which is a small, black piece of dry earth used by many Tanzanians as a fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative!<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 13 hours per day, six days per week. Fatuma currently earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy charcoal stock.  In the future, she plans to increase her stock. Fatuma thanks you for her support!\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This is 34-year-old Rachael K., who lives in the town of Mwanza.  She is single and has two children, aged one and five. For the last year, she has earned a living making clothes for women. Rachael works at this business for 12 hours per day, six days per week, and earns about $220 a month. She is applying for a loan of $400 to buy another sewing machine. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rachael thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, which is why they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy another sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-12T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010845},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233131},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664922},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105634},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022744},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867984},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757185},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146297},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984459}],"funded_date":"2009-05-12T23:36:19Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":111806,"name":"Nachia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nachia has been a bites (maandazi and bread) seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for 10 years.

She has been working on a construction project started by the Peruvian government for a few months while her husband works as a docent in a  high school.  She has been taking care of a piece of land for eight years.  She takes care of the land's needs to make it more productive with its harvests, mostly on the weekends.  She starts working very early and doesn't rest.  Her and her partner both love farming in spite of the fact that they also have other jobs.  Maria likes her land to be well cultivated and protected from insects even though transporting [the crops] to her city's market is difficult because the sacks of potatoes are heavy.  Because she is a hard worker, she wants to plant greater quantities of native potatoes, which are being sought after in the market for their anti-cancerous properties.  She would also like to build her own home to provide her family with an adequate quality of life.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she thanks all of the members of her communal bank, with whom she likes working, because they have allowed her to be part of this honest and hardworking group.  Maria plans to use the loan to buy several sacks of fertilizer which will provide adequate maintenance for her potato crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":552379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer to maintain her crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-13T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":355.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326807}],"funded_date":"2010-06-13T16:21:56Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":210988,"name":"Khom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Khom L. is 46 years old and is a villager who lives in Choes village, Takeo province.

In this farm, they face a problem because the field has infertile soil and there is not enough water to support their farming crop.

This is 40-year-old Cristina K. from Mbarali. She married with five children between the ages of 2 and 15.Cristina has been running a maize business since 2000. She buys maize from farmers and brings them back to her town where she can sell them for a higher price. She works at her business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her husband. \n\nShe is requesting a loan of 500 USD in order to purchase more maize in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Cristina thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Jamolbek is 30 years old and is married with two children. He is a farmer and grows wheat, corn, and tomatoes, something he has done for 5 years. This is the only thing he knows how to do and what he likes most. For Jamolbek, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the crops of his labor grow year after year. Jamolbek also raises cattle and his family helps him with his business. \r\n\r\nNow Jamolbek wants to borrow money to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his crops. This is Jamolbek's first loan from IMON International and he promises to repay the loan without any violations as he has done with previous loans.\r\n\r\nAbout Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Cinderella has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cinderella joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Meet Robert, a very hard-working farmer who is 40 years of age and is so full of energy. Robert hails from the Litein area of Kenya, an area that has good weather patterns and favors dairy and crop farming. Robert is a family man and he has nine children and a wife who he really loves, and you can always notice a pleasant feeling among his family members when he arrives at home every day from his farm. \r\n\r\nRobert practices mixed farming--that is, crop and dairy farming--and has been doing this for five years; he also keeps bee and farms tea so that he can make ends meet. Because of his large family, Robert has to work extra hard so that he can feed the nine stomachs that solely depend on him. Because of this, Robert tries to do many businesses so that he can supplement the income from crop farming.\r\n\r\nRobert would like to increase his dairy farming and be able to assure his children of a bright future. That is why he is seeking a loan of 57,200 KES to be able to buy a dairy cow, which will help him get more income through selling milk. The financial benefits that Robert will reap out of this investment are immediate because of the ready market for milk that already exists in his area.\r\n\r\nRobert is so disciplined with finances and he is sure that through the profits gathered from selling milk, he will be able to save enough and open a large dairy business that will assure his children of a secure future and uninterrupted learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1660641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":57200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3584.57},{"due_date":"2014-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4236.21},{"due_date":"2014-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4393.24},{"due_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4468.69},{"due_date":"2015-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4589.07},{"due_date":"2015-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4806.37},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4842.19},{"due_date":"2015-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4995.48},{"due_date":"2015-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5107.22},{"due_date":"2015-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5258.88},{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5386.48},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5531.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.84},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":834483,"name":"Stumai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stumai is a 19-year-old entrepreneur who is unmarried and lives with her family.

He has lived in the rural area his whole life and he only has a primary education. His two children are already grown up but they work with him on his farm. He is no longer married but is still widely considered as a family man because of the relantionship he maintains with his kids and their children. He will use part of the money from this loan for rice cultivation and the other part to maintain his cattle. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colon is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount that is missing. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage saving among the group. Promoting saving is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":18412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming and Cattle Ranching","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-02T01:49:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Colon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-17T22:37:01Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T14:56:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13838},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:38:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19610},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:55:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26600},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T22:18:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35707},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:26:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47473},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59565}],"funded_date":"2007-03-03T23:37:01Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:16:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":9414,"name":"Quy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miss Quy and her husband have three children between 7 and 12 years old.

This group of women, who are linked by ties of community, age, and clan, does trading in agricultural products and other goods of small-scale commerce.

The supply of the various goods is gotten from S\u00e9gou from wholesalers of the grand marketplace.  These women each have storage space on the allotted family plots for keeping their inventory.  They each intend to use this loan to buy:  one sack of beans, a sack and a half of rice, 15 sacks of millet, and 250 liters of milk. \r\n<p>Sales are made at the retail level, cash and credit accepted, from home most of the time and at the public square and in the marketplaces of nearby villages.
