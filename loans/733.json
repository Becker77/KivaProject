For the last 10 years she has worked selling yogurt. She was assisted by a cousin who taught her the craft, using milk as the principal ingredient. In the beginning, before she could make her product at home, she had to purchase milk from various people and dairies. As she saw that the cost of these purchases was very high, she decided to save her money to purchase a small milk cow. Over time, and through her the hard work caring for the animals, her cow had a calf, which increased her livestock population. Currently, she has three cows, which allow her to produce a greater quantity of yogurt and to increase her profit. Juana is very satisfied with what she has been able to accomplish; nevertheless, there are many more goals that she would like to reach. Because of this, she has decided to learn to make higher quality yogurt, and to establish a dairy at her home. She has the strength and the desire, and because of this she is requesting a $500 loan for the purchase of an additional cow.

She is married without children.  Refija raises cattle and earns roughly 350KM\/month by selling milk and milk products.  (The equivalent of roughly $230USD.)  \r\n\r\nIn the past, Refija hoped to get a contract with a milk factory, but was unable to do so.  She now considers this to be a blessing, as the milk factory reportedly exploits its workers.  By selling milk and milk products to her friends and neighbors, she earns a much higher margin and has more control over her work.\r\n\r\nRefija requests a 1,000KM loan from Women for Women International, which she will use to buy a new calf.

With loans, she was able to buy more products to satisfy her customers' needs. She is a married woman with four children who help her with her business so she can go out shopping in the market. With this loan, she would like to establish a larger grocery store. She also does mobile sales in Managua, offering spices like cinnamon, cloves and chamomile. \r\n\r\nJusta Pastora is a single mother who lives with her two young children. They help her with her business, which is making brooms. She learned this activity from her parents and she has taught it to her children. She dreams of having a good workshop and giving her children a secondary education. She sells her products in Managua, Tipitapa and other departments in the region.\r\n\r\nDigna Marina sells corn products like p\u00ecnolillo\/pinol (a traditional sweet cornmeal and cacao-based drink), tortillas, tamales, etc. She brings them to various customers who buy in bulk. She makes these products at home with her five children, taking advantage of the family's manual labor capabilities. Her young children are in school and also help her with the business. Her husband works in a shoe shop and helps her with household costs. With this loan, she hopes to buy raw materials like corn, sugar and firewood for the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThey live in humble conditions, and came to work with Adim because of a regional advertisement.

ago. These businesses evolved from raising one piglet and selling fish! Though profit from their businesses is fairly good, Eda needs help growing her business since all of her family's daily expenses, including expenses for the education of her children, need to be covered. \r\n<p>\r\nTo be able to accomplish her goal of increasing her profit, Eda decided to joining ASHI in 2007. The loans she requested then have been used to finance her hog and fish businesses. Eda has had two previous loans. However the growth she is dreaming of has yet to be reached, and she needs more business capital. She is now requesting a much larger amount to be able to buy more piglets and to finance a business weaving fruit trays using twigs. With these businesses, Eda hopes to be able to have more savings to help with her dream of buying a motorcycle to be used by her husband to sell fish. With her income, Eda is hoping to send all her children to college and have them graduate and have good careers.

Yadira competed in a haute couture competition at province level this year and she won first place.\r\n\r\nYadira has a small dressmaking workshop where she has been sewing all kinds of clothes (15th birthday dresses, bridal gowns, etc.) for many years.  However, she says that she loves making children's clothes.  She works on orders from individuals and also makes clothes for a store in the city center.  She works with the help of another person who she pays a monthly salary.\r\n\r\nYadira has been a member of her community bank for four years and she is very happy because it has helped her a lot.  She will use this new loan to buy fabric and other materials for her dressmaking business.  Her dreams are to have a bigger workshop in the city center where she can also sell her clothes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":661717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric, thread, zippers, buttons, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-12-10T21:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yadira Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683465},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422589},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841355},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283737},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151663}],"funded_date":"2010-12-12T10:38:13Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":260663,"name":"Ahmed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmed is a young man from Tulkarem, Ahmed and his brothers own a carpentry shop where they make furniture such as tables, chairs, beds, doors and windows. \r\n\r\nAhmed took a loan from the FATEN branch in Tulkarem (where he appears in the picture) to buy wood and make more furniture.

","en":"Martha Luz is 45 years old and lives in the city of Cartagena with her husband and three children who range in age from 4 to 14.  There she has a business called \u201cConfecciones Aldescu\u201d, which she started 10 years ago as a way to help support her household and cover some of the expenses since only her husband was contributing at the time.  Soon after her business was started, she began offering sewing services from her home.  Her business grew, but her customers did not provide her with the fabrics and supplies that she needed to make a particular dress, so she began producing at all costs and also started exhibiting dresses of different sizes.  Martha gradually acquired more merchandise such as cosmetics, lipsticks, perfumes, and other items so that she could increase her sales.  At the moment, she is taking advantage of the time of year when her sales rebound by stocking her business with products that she knows her customers will need.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason Martha is requesting a Kiva loan, her first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the money to buy raw materials for making dresses, as well as perfumes, cosmetics, shoes, and other items in time for the Day of Love and Friendship (the Colombian equivalent to Valentine\u2019s Day).  Martha will take advantage of this time to make many sales.  Her dream is to have a larger space where she can relocate her workshop so that she can create jobs and position herself within the community.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":856369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sewing materials, perfumes, cosmetics, shoes, and other items.

With a capital of Rp700,000 (about US$77), Ni Nengah Nerti with the help of her husband started to make red sugar from 15 coconut trees in their field.

From this income, Ni Nengah Nerti could meet her household needs, including education of her 2 children, and repair her simple home. Ni Nengah Nerti also sees an opportunity to expand her business, by being a red sugar distributor,  buying sugar from others, and resell it to a large vendor.

Usaha ini sudah digelutinya sudah beberapa tahun lamanya karena Ni Nengah Nerti melihat  bahwa pendapatannya sebagai petani biasa yang hanya mengelola lahan kebunnya dengan cara tradisional tidak mampu memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya yang sudah semakin meningkat. Dengan modal Rp. 700.000,- Ni Nengah Nerti dibantu suaminya memulai usaha pembuatan gula merah dengan memanfaatkan 15 pohon kelapa  yang ada di kebunnya. Setiap hari Ni Nengah Nerti mampu memproduksi 15 kg gula merah  dan dijualnya dengan harga Rp. 60.000,-  ( harga gula per kilogram = Rp. 4.000.- ) dan dalam sebulan Ni Nengah Nerti mendapat hasil dari usahanya Rp. 1.100.000,-. Dari pendapatannya  inilah Ni Nengah Nerti memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya termasuk menyekolahkan ke dua anaknya dan memperbaiki keadaan rumahnya yang masih sangat sederhana. Ni Nengah Nerti juga melihat peluang untuk mengembangkan usahanya dengan menjadi pengepul gula merah yaitu dengan membeli gula dari orang lain dan kemudian  dijual lagi kepada pengusaha besar tapi karena keterbatasan modal yang dimiliki Ni Nengah Nerti tidak bisa leluasa mengembangkannya. Tetapi dengan adanya pinjaman dari DINARI Nengah Nerti berharap usahanya bisa berkembang lagi dan hasilannyapun bisa

She runs a grocery business from a stall she rents at a large open air market in Kampala, where she sells tomatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, bananas (known locally as matooke), Irish potatoes and a ground nut paste that she makes herself.  She buys her produce from a market in the center of town, and gets matooke from an outlying village.  She manages her stall by herself six days a week, with Friday and Saturday being her busiest days.  She has operated this grocery business for the past 10 years.  Before that, she waited tables at Makarere University, but the salary was not enough for her and her family.  On her own, she knows she can have all of the profits, and she finds the market a much better place to work.\r\n<p>\r\nStill, she faces considerable challenges.  Power outages often make it impossible for her to use the machine that grinds the groundnuts into paste.  At home, she doesn\u2019t have power at all but uses paraffin lanterns, and she gets water from a nearby pump.\r\n<p>\r\nDeborah has been a member of MCDT for the past seven years and, working with her group, has received numerous loans.  She says that getting these loans has changed her life, giving her the capital needed to maintain her business and send her son to school.  With a new loan, she will expand her business, buying more stock to sell.  She also wants to finish building a home, so that she no longer has to rent.  Her eventual goal is to build houses that she can rent out to others."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":177026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies for a grocery store and finish work on a house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-07-05T05:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deborah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-20T22:56:40Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-08-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":256626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303178},{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-09-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":256626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334030},{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-25T07:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":256626,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368381},{"amount":156.33,"local_amount":246842.11,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":252322,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334428},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":255550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955622},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":255550,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14875993}],"funded_date":"2008-07-06T22:56:40Z","paid_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":59056,"name":"Mwantatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"45-year-old Mwantatu is married with two children, aged 14  and 12.

She has a business in food sales that she has been managing with her husband for ten years.  She lives in the Laureles Norte neighborhood in the capital city of Managua.  She has two children in primary school, who are 7 and 12 years old.  When she began the business, she did it with little savings and with a group loan.  Later on, she applied to borrow with Kiva partner Afodenic and is now on the fourth loan cycle.  She has benefited from the low interest rates and maintained her sales.  With this loan she will purchase basic grains and perishable goods to increase her food sales and be able to earn greater earnings, finish constructing her house, and support her children's studies.  This way, it is not as though she will not have the opportunity because of limited economic resources like her parents had.  Her objective is to be able to have a cafe and move forward in better conditions.  She thanks the institution for the financing that has allowed her to achieve her steady business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":397055,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase basic grains and perishables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:01:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":686.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713920},{"amount":68.36,"local_amount":1367.11,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1406.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601609},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":666.38,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":685.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841212},{"amount":31.86,"local_amount":637.24,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":655.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874124},{"amount":34.12,"local_amount":682.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":702.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604034},{"amount":34.7,"local_amount":694.05,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":714.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639504},{"amount":64.31,"local_amount":1286.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1323.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821273}],"funded_date":"2009-10-01T21:54:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Josh Wilcox","image":392254}},{"id":145185,"name":"Mrs. Sam Kory Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank, which consists of 23 people, is located in Pun Phnum Village in Takeo province.

She is 58 years old, married, and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, she runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She sells foods, snacks, and a variety of clothing. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty years and earns approximately $185 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Guadalope joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Guadalope is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 4th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Uiese has one year of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nUiese needs a loan of 1,000 Samoan talas to buy flour, flavoring, sugar and plastic bags. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or about $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Uiese joined SPBD. This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Uiese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD<\/b>\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Al principio era ella quien compraba para su uso pero un d\u00eda empez\u00f3 a ofrecer a sus amistades d\u00e1ndose cuenta de que le gustaba.

She is a travelling merchant who sells eiderdowns and sheets. In the area where her home is located, they have basic utilities; her house is made of cement. She is married to Daniel, who is retired and lives off his pension. Patricia tells us that her husband retired 4 years ago and that is was that who pushed her to start her business. Offering and selling products is done with her daughter in the mornings, since the latter has secondary school in the afternoon. Patricia also sells prepared meals to other households. Patricia tells us that the most important thing for her has been the support of her daughter, who is very responsible for her age. She tells us that for a while she was ill and could not make the rounds to sell her products but her daughter took over those tasks. Patricia hopes to help her daughter reach university so that she can have a bright future. Patricia has two other children who attend state-run school. With the loan, she will buy sheets and eiderdowns to sell. Her dream is to have a small restaurant where to serve typical food."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1109045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"venta de productos de belleza y ropa por catalogo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1557.03,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":118.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":121.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":124.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":126.97},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":130.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":132.85},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":135.88},{"due_date":"2013-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":139.96},{"due_date":"2013-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":142.17},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":162.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.45},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.58},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.81},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":441207,"name":"Theresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theresa sells maize at Eguafo near Elmina.

She lost her job after the disintegration of the USSR. Her husband was laid off as well. In order to not be financially dependent on her children and maintain her lifestyle she began working in sales. Back in 2003 her assets amounted to $150. She was selling children's clothing. Thanks to the loan and her commitment to the MicroInvest program she was able to increase her assets to $700. She was able to secure a permanent sales point and expanded her inventory to include children's shoes. In the future she is planing to procureanother sales point and increase turnover. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jane Mazur, Kiva

They are all married and live in traditional extended families with co-wives and other parents in San Prefecture (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  United by ties of profession and community, the members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program two years ago.  The group is on its fourth solidarity loan (group loan).

Balitan is 50 years old. She is not married. Reyna has 3 sons whose ages are the following: her oldest son is 26 years old and works for himself; her 24 year old son is not studying; and her youngest son, who is 22, does not study. Her life partner works for himself. Her goal is to continue with her work because it is the only source of income for her family. She has to look for the daily sustenance for her family as well as for herself. She hopes to have good health so that she can continue with her work; another of her hopes is to be able to travel because she would like to see other parts of the world. Her dream is to help her family get ahead so that in the future they can take over the business and not have any difficulties resolving problems.\r\n\r\nReyna works in general sales and she sells products such as: blouses, underwear, socks, and other things. She is a street vendor and has had this business for 15 years. Reyna began this business because she has always liked to work, ever since she was young. This gave her the idea to begin a business selling gold jewelry, but over time this didn\u2019t go well for her because some customers didn\u2019t pay the debts they had with her. So, she decided to start another business and started offering products such as: new clothing, cosmetics, perfumes, and silver jewelry. She established this business and gained customers. It was difficult at first, but now things are going well. The loan is for working capital so that she can make purchases in Managua and Chinandega of the following products: lotions, perfumes, and silver jewelry. She is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the organizations that give their help so that she can carry out her dreams and goals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer

She doesn't have children, but she has two [nieces and\/or nephews] who she dearly loves.  She wants to get ahead in life and live as well and happily as she can.  She works hard, having strived all her life to get ahead, doing many things to pay her way and finally starting her own business 7 months ago.  She now has a store where she sells everything and where she's set up a \"locutorio\" [a business providing phone and Internet services] so that her neighbors can call their loved ones.  Luzmila dreams of growing her business and increasing her income.  What she most likes about her business is that she can tend both the locutorio and her own house at the same time, something that allows her to balance the two.  She doesn't like having to stay in the shop all day, though, without being able to go out.  Nevertheless, she's very happy to have her own business and prepared to work hard to get ahead.  This is Luzmila's second MPF loan and she expects to pay the installments on time, just as she did with the first loan.

They average 47 years of age and 5 children. The members of the group live in large extended traditional families in the Konda village (prefecture of San, in the S\u00e9gou region, Republic of Mali). They got acquainted through bonds of neighborhood and kinship. They run very similar businesses, namely transforming n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts into \"sounbala\" (a food condiment very much appreciated in Mali) for selling. To meet an ever-increasing customer demand, the Djiguiya group sought to solve his problems by joining Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, from which it is seeking its second solidarity loan (group loan). The previous loan was repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women intend to use this loan to buy sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts in Sikasso, in order to transform them into sounbala. It is then dried and packaged, before being wholesaled for cash in Mopti (Fifth region in the Republic of Mali). During this loan cycle, they hope to turn a profit of XOF 65'000 (ca US$ 130) each, to be used to repay the loan and to provide for their extended families.

She has been in this business for several years and has been able to support her family.  Inoyathon is 40 years old and has 3 children.

is 46 years old and a married mother of four children, all of whom are in school. To support her household, she has been selling cereals such as beans, maize and groundnuts, to her loyal customers at the community market. She takes delivery of stock from Atebubu in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, and retails it to her customers. \r\n<p>\r\nRegina says selling these products is very lucrative and, with ten years of experience, she can increase her market share.

She lives in her own house with her husband Manuel (40) and her children; Luz(21), Liz (15) and Manuel (12).  She is an enterprising and hard working woman, and because of this, when an opportunity to start a new business presents itself, she takes it since she knows that she can accomplish anything with a lot of effort and she knows that hard work always has its reward.  Because of this, when she started selling sleepwear and polos she wasn\u2019t afraid, she is a good saleswoman and works selling her clothes to her clients on credit.  She also sells a recognized brand of beauty products and if that weren\u2019t enough, on the weekends she wakes up early to prepare tamales (a corn flour based dish) and sells them outside a bakery in the area where she lives.  She loves these three activities that she performs because they keep her occupied and they generate good earnings that allow her to help with household expenses.   For the future, she plans on installing a clothing shop in a market in her neighborhood in order to have a more stable place to sell.  This is the fourth loan she has had from MFP and she promises to be punctual with each payment when the amount is due since she would like to have access to loans in the future.  With the money that she\u2019s asking for she will buy a larger quantity of clothes in order to start selling summer clothing since she already has a lot of orders she needs to fill.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shane Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":483905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-06T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:25Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960335},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993183},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717968},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751644},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934110},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":107.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672885}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T20:09:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shane Crandall","image":null}},{"id":178462,"name":"Jose Edison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jose Edison P., from the village of Guinsiliban,  Camiguin  Province, is 30 years old, married and has four school-aged children.

She is single and lives with her eight-year-old daughter, Milagros.  The last nine years have been devoted to taking care of her general store which she runs out of her home.  This business allows her to cover her the expenses for her household and also for the education of her little girl.  Her daughter also tends the shop if she has to step out.  That's how they are working together to get ahead in search of progress, and they both like the business since it is very pleasant and most of the customers are neighbors, oftentimes friends.  Unfortunately, at times it can be very tiring to remain there all day long, because the winter season has begun and it's getting colder all the time.  Even so, she is struggling very hard to reach her goal, which is to expand her business until she has a large bazaar where she can offer a wider variety of merchandise.  This is her first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and she hope to punctually complete every one of the agreed upon payments.

She started this business through an invitation from one of her friends that showed her the trade. She has been working independently from the comfort of her home, so that she can maintain her home and care for her children. She has a fixed work schedule, having very steady work carrying out her craft. Given the complexity of some of the embroidery work, she can take up to one month to complete. The fruit of her work is a beautiful traditional piece that is admired by her clients. They ultimately purchase her pieces of work. The most profitable time of year is during the traditional festivals in her region called \"la fiesta del Santiago\", meaning the Feast of Santiago. In the future Victoria wishes to increase the number of embroidered skirts she makes and to contract out some work to help out with the embroidery. This is the first time she has requested a loan from MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is very happy to be a new member of the Community Bank.

He is 35 years old, married and the father of five children aged 15, 13, 12, 11 and two years old. The four oldest children go to school. He completed professional middle school, and lives in his own house with his family and does not support any others. \r\n<p>\r\nHe left Panda with his family in 1995 for Maputo, transferred by work. He has been a state functionary for 14 years as a teacher in the Ministry of Education, working on average eight hours per day and earning a salary of 9000 Meticais a month. He is also owner of a shop, and works with his wife selling sodas and other drinks. They manage to bring in between 10,000 and 15,000 Meticais monthly, and save something in the bank every month.   \r\n<p>\r\nHe had loans from the commercial BIM bank, and decided not to continue when he learned about Hluvuku from a friend who is a client of the organization. This is the third loan, in the amount of 25,000 Meticais, with which he intends to buy products for his shop (soft drinks, beer and wines). The previous amounts were 11,000 Meticais and 18,000 Meticais, both for the same business. \r\n<p>\r\nHe encountered difficulties growing his business due to a lack of electricity, which obliged him to use an uneconomical gas refrigerator. But with this loan he will increase his income sufficiently, by acquiring additional products to satisfy his market. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future he plans to request additional loans to improve his commercial establishment and residence, and to acquire his own means of transportation. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

Kaongkod, Madredijos, Cebu City. She earns her living by engaging in livestock raising and farming.\r\n\r\nLuisa\u2019s husband, Porperio, is a 60 years old farmer, and they have 5 children who are between 12-28 years old.  Two of their children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.  They have 1 married child while the other 2 are working.\r\n\r\nLuisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by raising livestock and farming.  Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 3,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLuisa is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 18,000 was used to fund operations of her livestock rising and farming, and it has had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 12th loan in the amount of Php 18,000, which she intends to use on her livestock raising and farming business. Luisa is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

After the economic crisis reached Tajikistan, purchasing prices rose so Zarina needed a loan to maintain her inventory. She has established a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity, having repaid every loan received from IMON International without any defaults. This time, Zarina is asking to borrow 10 000 TJS to purchase candies and sweets wholesale. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and develop her trade even more.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Susana has dedicated herself to the sale of fruits for the past 9 years in the market in \u201cPachacutec\u201d, which is located in her same neighborhood given that this is her principal source of income. Her daughter Roxana helps her in this work by taking care of their stand when her mother leaves to purchase more merchandise or has some setback. Susana enjoys her work very much given that she is always in contact with people and has become good friends with her neighbors in the market. In addition, the effort that she puts forth in her job and the happiness with which she attends her customers make for good sales and give her satisfactory earnings. Like with any micro-enterprise, Susana wants to expand her business and to make it much more prosperous, for which she needs to install a new roof on her stand. Susana has worked with the MFP Bank for approximately 3 years, being a punctual client and responsible with her payments.

A  specialist in shoes since 1968, Mr. B. is a teacher of shoe-making at the Maurice De La Fosse high school in Dakar. He took up this profession out of love and believes that the protective element of shoes and their elegance are the most important aspects of his work. Concerned by the necessity to manage his affairs by himself, Mr. B. is planning to run a parallel activity by setting up his own workshop and making products (shoes, bags) to sell; he plans also to train young people who do not have the opportunity to go to school. Thus, in order to advance his work, Mr. B. would like a loan of 150,000 FCFA from his savings bank, Jammi Xaleyi, which belongs to U-IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual savings and loans institutions) in Thies. He is planning to buy basic materials for 55,000 FCFA, and the balance of 55,000 FCFA will be used to cover personal needs (to pay the electricity bill for his house, rent..). Finally in thanking his lenders in advance, Mr. B. thinks that the loan will allow him to settle his debts and  to create products (such as the bag in the photo, which he made himself) for sale. \r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":501386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Get supplies of basic materials and pay expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-06T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aboubakrine Moussa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92.86,"local_amount":42857.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":44805.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759260},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790770},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:25Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971208},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708477},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922536},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.58,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":22402.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189042}],"funded_date":"2010-03-07T00:56:17Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":186973,"name":"Sosina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sosina  Suilaulau is 56 and married with 5 children.

He works as a teacher en Tecuantepe and has 12 years of experience in this field.\r\n\r\nThey live in a very humble home due to their limited finances. For this reason, they seek a loan to purchase construction materials that will allow them to improve and above all repair their home. With the credit, they will buy stone, iron, cement, and gravel to improve the wall behind their home and to tile the patio, because in the winter insects bring many illnesses that threaten the health of their young children. It is for the satisfaction of their children that they wish to see through this economic feat, as well as the protection of their family members since they live in an area of the city that does not

Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many tourist attraction sites, not forgetting the Indian Ocean's white beaches.

She has 2 children who are students, Joseph who is 14 and Jhon who is 9 years old. They live together in the town of Santa Rosa where they have their own home. \r\n\r\nMigna says that everything that comes with the name of cocoa creates business. This is why she tries to give the best care to their cocoa plantations, under the premise that her buyers have been satisfied with the quality of her crops. Then again, she does her very best and that is why she spends so much time in her work, together with her husband\u2019s help. But during the harvesting she needs day workers, in order to reap the harvests, and by these efforts obtaining a good financial position. She usually sells her crops in the neighborhood collection centers at a good price. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 8th loan through MFP, and she is very happy knowing that she can obtain financial help so she can feel secure buying the items she proposes and she is very happy to be a member of the community bank.

She lives in her own house with her husband and two younger children. Yoel is 13, and Yenny is 7, both of whom are the motivation for all her efforts. She's a young mother who learned early on the art of transforming reed mace (cattails or bulrush) into handmade craftwork. She learned this art from her parents and currently sells them. She does this as a traveling saleswoman, since she has no fixed place where she can sell her craftwork. What she enjoys most in her work is that she has to liberty to choose which hours she works and which hours she dedicates to her family. She has been doing this for 15 years and feels very happy carrying out this work. What she least likes is having to walk the streets in search of customers.\r\n<p>\r\nFor that reason, she desires to have a store where she could sell her crafts more comfortably and thus better serve her customers, since she knows that the success of her business depends on them.
