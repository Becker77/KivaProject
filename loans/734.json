The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Nancy will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mafanikio group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":928623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-27T04:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":38500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":38500,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":40590,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681045}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T18:53:44Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":366932,"name":"Sor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sor is 33 years old and a mother of three children, living in Ornlong Veng district, Siem Reap province of Cambodia.

P. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer for her field in order to make her crop more productive. Mrs. P. P. is a 58-year-old widow with five children, four of whom are employed in a garment factory while the youngest one is attending the local school. \r\n\r\nTwo members in this village bank have end-of-term (EoT) loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. The end-of-term loan members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial loans for Cambodia's poor. EoT loans allow people to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09 percent and AMK has a default rate of 0 percent on

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To make more bricks to sell to customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":106280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010854},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":106280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233140},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:37Z","rounded_local_amount":106280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664931},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":106280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105643},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":106280,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022753}],"funded_date":"2009-05-13T19:19:09Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":112015,"name":"Aura Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Aura es soltera, de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene 3 hijos, todos casados, habita con una hija, pero quiere construir un cuarto para darle privacidad a su hija.

(1054002-02) is a 64-year-old woman living in the town of Saipipi. She is married and has eight adult children.\r\n\r\nSaini owns and operates a business raising crops, primarily planting and harvesting taro for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 300 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Saini joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\r\n\r\nSaini is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST which will be used to invest in expanding her business. The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Azamat is dedicated to the production of onion, potato and carrot. With a lot of effort and sacrifice he carries out this work every day for the purpose of improving the conditions of his family, bringing the daily bread to his table and, at the same time, saving for the improvement of his dwelling, which needs a lot of help because it is in bad state which little by little he has come to improve. Azamat is married with 5 children. His family admires him for the fact that his multiple efforts have permitted him to bring food to his home and that in addition he has managed to keep his children in school. The need that this gentleman faces is that he needs to invest in his business through the purchase of seeds and fertilizer. By this Azamat hopes that Kiva will offer him the loan to do well along with his family. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling bamboo handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Levene has 2 years of experience in this business.  Levene needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Levene joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Levene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Levene E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use this loan to invest in her clothing business by traveling to Santo Domingo to purchase blouses, sweaters, skirts and pants in the main market to sell at a profit in her community. Biola will use the profits to invest in her business and save towards being able to take larger loans and further invest in her business. She thanks you all for your support. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2400,"image":{"id":510032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Monina is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the seventh loan she has taken out from GDMPC.

This city is the third most important city in Ecuador, and has great architectural and cultural treasures, a varied cuisine, and very warm and friendly residents.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngela Lucia B. lives near the polytechnic university.  This is her second loan from the foundation; it was her sister who invited her to join the communal bank.  The loans are very helpful for her business.  \u00c1ngela makes a living selling Avon products, and has been involved in this activity for one year.  She doesn\u2019t have a fixed work schedule, but sells her products to her friends and family.  She also makes a living doing domestic chores, an activity that she has performed for 15 years.  This job doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule either, since all that her employers ask is for her to do her work responsibly.  \u00c1ngela is 34 years old, married, and has 4 children, ages 18, 16, 13, and 11.  Her oldest daughter works and helps her financially, while the three younger children study at a school in the city.  Her husband works at a body shop (he repairs the car bodies).  The family doesn\u2019t have its own house and lives in the home of \u00c1ngela\u2019s mother, though they are not dependent on her.  \u00c1ngela\u2019s new loan will be invested in more cosmetics.  Her dream is to have a house of her own.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Eugenia M. lives in the center of the city of Cuenca.  She is 49 years old, and has been separated from her husband for 2 years.  She has a 24-year-old daughter who is studying to be a veterinarian at the university.  They don\u2019t own their own home, but live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda makes a living cleaning houses.  She started working in this activity when she was very young and it has helped to get her family ahead.  For the past 2 years she has also made a living raising guinea pigs, which she sells at her home.  She is on her second loan with the communal bank and will use it to invest in purchasing more guinea pigs.  Mar\u00eda wants to help her daughter complete her university studies, and her dream is to have her own home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Basilisa plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward greater profitability.\r\n<br>Basilisa's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life.

Vive en casa propia con su hermano en el distrito de Olmos, una zona agr\u00edcola de bastante movimiento comercial que se encuentra situada en la provincia de Lambayeque, a m\u00e1s de una hora y media de la ciudad de Chiclayo. Durante toda su vida, Hugo se ha dedicado a la crianza y venta de ganado mayor y menor como los vacunos, caprinos y ovinos. Esta actividad es su principal fuente de ingresos para su sustento diario. Actualmente, su casa se encuentra en un estado deteriorado. Desea usar su cr\u00e9dito para hacer unos arreglos en su hogar lo que mejorar\u00e1 su condici\u00f3n de vida. Por ello, ha cre\u00eddo conveniente solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un pr\u00e9stamo de 700 nuevos soles. Con este pr\u00e9stamo, Hugo no tendr\u00e1 que recurrir a prestamistas informales los cuales le cobrar\u00edan tasas alt\u00edsimas. Edpyme le ofrece su cr\u00e9dito a una tasa de inter\u00e9s m\u00e1s baja que otras entidades bancarias y los prestamistas informales. Eso le permitir\u00e1 a Hugo trabajar tranquilo sin perjudicar su liquidez diario. Hugo posee muy buenas referencias personales y laborales de su comunidad rural.

He lives in his own house with his brother in the Olmos district, a rural area with a good commercial activity located in the Lambayeque province and at more than an hour and a half form the city of Chiclayo. For all of his life, Hugo has engaged in breeding and selling livestock such as cattle, goats and sheep. This activity is his main source of income for his everyday necessities. As his house is currently in a dilapidated state, he wishes to use his credit to make some repairs in his house, thus improving his living conditions. For this reason he has thought it convenient to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 700 PEN. Thanks to this loan, Hugo will not have to turn to informal loan sharks that would ask for very high interest rates. Edpyme grants him his loan at a lower interest rate than other banks and loan sharks. This will enable Hugo to work comfortably without risking his daily liquidity. Hugo has received very good personal and professional references from his rural community. He is very responsible and he promptly complies with his obligations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":747454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To make some repairs to his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Olmos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-04-10T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hugo Mar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":73.11},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":92.26},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.06},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.03},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.11,"local_amount":73.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":73.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206138245},{"amount":28.89,"local_amount":80.88,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":81.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210806},{"amount":30.06,"local_amount":84.17,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489059},{"amount":31.03,"local_amount":86.89,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":87.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205236},{"amount":31.89,"local_amount":89.29,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":89.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181980},{"amount":102.02,"local_amount":285.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":286.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232778973}],"funded_date":"2011-04-17T21:08:25Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:45:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":293154,"name":"Klaudy Yohanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Klaudy Yohanna F. se dedica a la venta de productos de consumo popular, tiene un mercadito ubicado en su casa de habitacion.

She makes women's clothing. She started her business 2 yeas ago. Initially it was based in her own home, but as it grew she acquired new infrastructure such as machines and had to rent out some premises to meet the needs of her business and the demand from her customers. \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to continue to improve the infrastructure of her business through the purchase of new machines that will help her better her production times and increase sales. Her main challenge is the lack of working capital to invest and increase her customer base, and this is what she's aiming to achieve with her Kiva loan. She has now applied for her first loan with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy fabric, lace and other materials wholesale to fulfil orders from her customers and have enough stock to respond effectively to business demand. \r\n\r\nAt the moment Rosiris has an employee and a stable client base in the working class neighbourhoods where she sells her finished clothing. She also offers a tailor-made service on a one-to-one basis. Her suppliers are established warehouses in the city of Barranquilla, where she buys in cash.

Now I need to be ready with fabric and sewing accessories as the vacation breaks and Christmas are approaching, as there is greater demand for services during this time. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHola mi nombres es Erika, mi actividad principal es la confecci\u00f3n de ropa, cuento con un peque\u00f1o taller en mi casa de habitaci\u00f3n, tengo 2 a\u00f1od de dedicarme a este tipo de actividad, la que me genera ingresos, con los que puedo contribuir con los gastos de mi familia.

Ni Putu Y. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 300,000 - 400,000 IDR a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Ni Putu Y. joined DINARI to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ni Putu Y. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,500,000 IDR from DINARI. This previous loan was used to expand the shelter for her livestock. Ni Putu Y. is now requesting a new loan of 2,600,000 IDR, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from DINARI. Ni Putu Y. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\n\nAbout DINARI: The mission of DINARI is to strive for the preservation of the environment, to empower the poor, and to provide socio-economic development opportunities to small business owners.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She gives her customers credit for two-week periods.  She sells clothes, shoes, and silver jewelry from Avon catalogs.  Juana has been doing this for 8 years.  She began with money that her sister loaned her at low interest rates.  Later, to increase sales she began to borrow at AFODENIC, increasing her investments and her customer base.\r\n<p>\r\nHer house is simple, half concrete and half boards.  Little by little, she has been making changes.

She owns a business venture, selling fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Musuva has 2 years of experience in this business.  Musuva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Musuva joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Musuva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Musuva I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The cacao, coffee, and peanuts grown by Juan have earned him notoriety because of their high quality.  As a result, he is able to sell these products at good prices.  What he enjoys most about his work is protecting his crops from harmful pests that could negatively impact his income.  Juan has been farming for 18 years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting the heavy sacks of product from the fields to the drying stations.  \r\n<p>\r\nHe needs a loan in order to buy sacks of compost so that he can improve his land and have an abundant harvest of high quality product.  Later on, Juan plans to buy more land so that he can plant more peanuts.  This is his second loan.  Juan is very pleased to know that he will receive financial support.  Now that he has been assured of his loan request, Juan promises to submit his payments on time and according to schedule.

All group members were born and live in the Chozvo area. The group sells its crop at a fair price to Empresa de Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agricola Lda (ECA), a local agribusiness which both acts as a buyer and provides the farmers with quality farming inputs and technical advice. An investment by AgDevCo has allowed ECA to purchase a state-of-the-art maize mill, designed for use in rural areas, so it can process the farmers\u2019 crop before selling it on. The group in total farms 19 hectares of land. All farming is done manually. The farmers require finance to purchase vital farming inputs - all of them purchase seed and some choose to also purchase fertilizer. \n\nAccess to a group loan of 31,540 Meticais (938 USD) equates to an average of 1,314 Meticais (39 USD) per participant- enough for the farmers to purchase from ECA the inputs they need. Farming conditions in the area are extremely tough with only intermittent rainfall. However, since becoming participants on the Chozvo scheme all the farmers report life becoming easier. They can afford good quality fertilizer, which is purchased from ECA. The farmers\u2019 crops are also bought by ECA every week - they come to their farms so the participants do not need to walk long distances to find a market for their crops.

Its history includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and many famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Calder\u00f3n has a property that measures 6 blocks long with different types of areas to develop.  She has 2 blocks that she uses to raise basic grains (beans and corn), 1 block which she uses to grow vegetables.  She has a tomato crop with an irrigation system, for which she will use the loan.  It is to buy agricultural supplies such as: 400 kilograms of urea fertilizer, 700 kilograms of fertilizer, and to pay the farm workers' wages for this crop.  This client began by farming basic grains and only did so in the winter season.  She worked with the help of her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is married and has a husband and 2 young children who cannot help them with the farm work.  On a typical work day, her husband gets up early at 4:30 in the morning to light the fire with the dry wood that he collects in the fields, as they have no other alternative in order to prepare their food.  Later she prepares coffee and food that they take with them to the fields, as well as food that is for her children who stay home and are looked after by her niece, because they are young.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe has dedicated her whole life to this type of work and is still doing it.  Now, in addition to growing basic grains, she also grows vegetables, which she hopes will allow her to continue improving and expanding her labors to be able to produce more foods and better foods on her lands.  This would help improve her income, allowing her to improve her quality of life.  In the future, she hopes to be able to dedicate more time to her children and take care of them herself.  Right now she and her husband have to work together in order to complete the harvest and in this way generate their income, as they depend solely upon their work in the fields.  \r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Andrea has had 3 loans with Ceprodel and has been working with them for 3 years.  The loans have been beneficial and their impact is very strong, since they allow her to improve her work and, as a result, to improve her quality of life by having higher earnings for herself and for her family. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":483281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and pay wages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-02-04T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":9200,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":9420.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166823456}],"funded_date":"2010-02-05T03:06:23Z","paid_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":178153,"name":"Faaifo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faaifo U. is 32 and married with 4 children.

Aida B. is the leader of this group.  She is from the town of Balykchi.  At the age of 29, she has already lived through a lot: marriage, a harsh reality of wide-spread unemployment and a simplest need to survive in order to raise two children, who she has after her marriage.  Aida decided not to ask for help from her relatives and did not wait for anyone else\u2019s help.  Instead, she started diligently saving money in order to start her own business.  She was able to have some savings four years ago and started selling children\u2019s clothing at the market.  But not everything happened smoothly.  She encountered many obstacles.  Not having her own retail outlet was the biggest obstacle.  However, the desire to change her quality of life and provide the children with good nutrition, warm clothing and comfort at home, gave Aida additional tenacity and drive to achieve success.  And finally, it all happened.  Whereas her previous turnover was only five and a half thousand som ($125) while not owning a retail stand, now, with having the retail stand, her turnover increased to twenty-five thousand som ($550).  Her monthly income is twelve thousand som.  And while the children are growing up and going to kindergarten, Aida has lots of plans for the future.  The goal of this loan is putting money toward increasing the spring variety of children\u2019s clothing.  Aida wants to open her own store in the future.\r\n\r\nAida has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nJamal S. is twenty-nine years old.  She is married and has three children.  Her husband works at a spirit manufacturing plant and gets a good, average salary.  Jamal is a homemaker.  She requested this loan for consumer needs.\r\n\r\nZamira D. is fifty years old.  Her husband had to leave and go to Moscow for work.  Zamira has one daughter, who is currently attending a university.  Zamira sews traditional goods: blankets, pillows, and sells them.  She requested this loan in order to purchase sewing materials.\r\n\r\nAysha A. is forty-seven years old.  She has one fourteen-year-old son and a husband.  Her husband works as a machinist at the city water station.  Aysha helps her husband with livestock purchases.  The husband purchases the livestock, and Aysha takes care of it.  They decided to request a loan to purchase a cow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":500659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase spring variety of children\u2019s clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Balykchi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jamal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zamira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6652},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6970},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7303},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":7653},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8019},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":8403}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":151.52,"local_amount":6652,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":6730.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989904},{"amount":158.76,"local_amount":6970,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":7051.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715715},{"amount":166.35,"local_amount":7303,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7388.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748563},{"amount":174.31,"local_amount":7653,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":7742.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931537},{"amount":182.66,"local_amount":8019,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:29Z","rounded_local_amount":8113.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670550},{"amount":191.4,"local_amount":8403,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8501.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884207}],"funded_date":"2010-03-06T17:58:39Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":186649,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Francisca tiene 48 a\u00f1os D. edad ella vive con su esposo y sus 5 hijos los cuales son todos peque\u00f1os con edades D. 15, 10, 8, 5, y 2 a\u00f1os.

Francisca is a woman who is always seeking to proviD. a better life for her children, including better food, health and education.

Doris, she says she has been married for 21 years.  She has three children, two of whom are adults and the other is a beautiful baby who she adores.  Doris and her family live at the home of her in-laws because they are elderly and not able to care for themselves.  Several years ago, her husband was in a serious car accident and is not able to work.\r\n<p>\r\nDoris says her situation was very difficult because she did not have any money.  A friend convinced her to start selling products manufactured by Yanbal (a company that offers beauty products, perfumes, and other accessories through catalogs).  She has done this for several years and says that she has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nDoris sells her products door to door in the evenings and also through orders from her customers.  She says that she often buys products when they are on sale.  Doris purchases them at half price and then sells them at regular price to generate more income.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis new loan will be used to buy more products that are on sale.  Doris is a founding member of her Communal Bank and is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR for the support it has provided during all of her difficult moments.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer goal is to have a house of her own and provide her children with a good education.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":592850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cr\u00e8mes, perfumes, costume jewelry, and Yanbal cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-31T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Normita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113579},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407311},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407312},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388421},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388422},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682856},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421993}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T01:46:41Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":231715,"name":"David Elias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or David vive en alquiler tiene dos hijitos que est\u00e1n estudiando en el colegio su esposa trabaja en una empresa y vende ropa.

His business, which is eight years old, is flourishing as more and more Tajiks buy vehicles, and the items he sells are always in high demand. To take advantage of this demand, he is applying for a loan for $3,000 to buy more items to sell to his customers. His goals are to maintain his leading position in the market and continue to expand his business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

When Ahmad gets the loan, he will replace the taxi doors and this will improve the condition of his taxi. Ahmad will work extra hours to increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions. Ahmad is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n \r\n\r\n

Eager to help her husband in earning money to sustain their family needs, her hopes of having access to capital to start a business materialized.  She wisely used her previous loans for her food vending business and as rolling capital for the retail of dried fish and bamboo sets, both her primary businesses and both productive enough to enable her to sustain the needs of her family.<p>\r\n\r\nNow on her eighth loan, Cecilia is requesting 19,000 pesos as additional rolling capital for her businesses. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 40 pieces of bamboo beds, 2 bamboo sets, 40 kilos of assorted dried fish, all for resale, and a gallon of cooking oil, sugar, bananas, and pork for her food vending business.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that with the help of ASHI and KIVA, she can reach her dreams of sending her children to school, having a rolling store, and repairing her house to make it more spacious and

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting.  Fiapito has many years of experience in this business.  Fiapito needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Fiapito joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fiapito's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiapito T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Intelligently, he is seeking a loan from IMON International in order to acquire additional animalsfor his farm.  \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works tirelessly and tries hard for her livelihood. Presently her daughter is already married but she is still living with Mrs Math in the same house.

is part of the first Communal Bank formed by Mifex in the rural town of Salitre. On her farm she cultivates rice and corn with the help of her husband and some of the children she had who are now adults. She hopes that with the loan she will be able to directly invest in rice seeds and pesticides that will help keep the crop healthy. She is also hoping she can purchase chickens for her farm as a secondary source of income. She is pictured at the Mifex offices after filling out her application. <\/p>\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":33386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase items for rice farming and also invest in chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-29T05:41:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-15T10:06:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:50:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19621},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T14:09:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26611},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:09:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36158},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:32:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47483},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:24:27Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59576}],"funded_date":"2007-05-01T10:06:39Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:24:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13751,"name":"Rahima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rakhima (her husband is pictured) is a 27-year-old mother of 2 children.

But gradually he has become an expert in this type of activity and now he has his own apprentices. Currently, he wishes to grow his business and improve his family's quality of life. Today Kudrat is requesting a loan of 800 USD, which he will use to purchase the necessary material for repairing houses in order to provide his high quality service and to be able to fulfill pending jobs and orders on time.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She supervises the work of her laborers who are charged with looking after the crops of corn, potatoes, and other vegetables that are grown on her land.  Even though an illness prevents her from performing strenuous activity, this does not keep her away from the production of her crops.  Her husband operates a locksmith shop in a rented location, where he also manufactures door and windows.  In his spare time, he helps Florencia with the work in the fields.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhat she enjoys most is irrigating her crops because, according to her, the sight of running water flowing through the furrows helps to distract her.  However, the most difficult part of her job is washing the beets and cauliflower before they are taken to the city market.  From the profits she has earned, Florencia was able to establish her husband\u2019s shop.  They both want to expand this business so that he will have more equipment to facilitate his work as a locksmith.  Their greatest wish is to open a hardware store or an iron distribution center.  \r\n<p>\r\nFlorencia is taking her tenth loan with MFP and hopes to achieve her goal.  She is also very proud to be continuing her work with her Communal Bank, which led to making progress alongside her family and learning how to invest her loan proceeds.  With this loan of 3000 PEN, she will purchase twelve sacks of fertilizer.  In order to finish the roof of her house, she will also buy nails and 120 sheets of corrugated metal.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":510149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers for her fields & corrugated metal and nails to finish the roof of her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-22T13:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3005.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153918}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T16:02:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":190778,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa tiene 56 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy trabajadora y alegre, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposo Hugo (56) y lo que m\u00e1s desea es tener una vejez tranquila.El negocio al que Rosa se dedica, es la venta D. cuyes, gallinas y patos, a los cuales tiene bien alimentados y cuidados.

realized their hobby of publishing free software online had the potential to earn them a profit. Two and a half years ago, Stephen decided to turn his long-time website, which offered free and safe software downloads, into a business by opening up advertising space on it. This was the official start of their business because, as Stephen says, \u201cFrom day one, it was instantly profitable.\u201d \r\n\r\nStephen and Melinda\u2019s website, www.safefreesoftware.com, offers their clients eight categories of virus-free software downloads: security, games, video, audio, apps, internet, business and website development. In total, they offer 6,727 programs, which means that a visitor to their site is bound to find something that fits their needs. The high traffic resulting from this diversity of reliable content has contributed to the success of the advertising space offered on the website.\r\n\r\nDespite their impressive initial success, Stephen and Melinda are very excited to continue growing their business. Along with continuing to offer reliable software downloads, they are now adding another component to the site that will keep customers informed about the world of software development. Under Melinda\u2019s guidance, the site now has an \u201ceditorial\u201d page, which will teach the reader about a certain kind of software each day. With this in mind, the website now boasts that returning customers can \u201clearn something new every day!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis loan made the new editorial section of the website possible. The remainder of the funds are going to the development of advertising space on other sites to draw in more customers. Stephen says that, though the new developments on the site allow it more traffic from search engines, the daily budget still runs primarily on ads that he and Melinda put on other sites. \r\n\r\nThe biggest business successes that publish-ME.com, LLC has seen, according to Stephen and Melinda, are its instant and continued profitability and that is has allowed Melinda to devote herself 100% to her own business. While Stephen still manages another full-time career, Melinda develops the business and writes its content full time. Without this loan, Stephen says that the business would have taken much longer to get to the point that it\u2019s at now; with it, Stephen and Melinda are able to continue expanding their business and providing reliable services to their loyal clientele.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9225,"image":{"id":804749,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She buys the chicks in Portoviejo in an incubator, and cares for them for about two to three months until they are ready and at a good weight.  Later, she gives them to merchants who go to her house to buy both the chickens and pigs and, other times, she takes them to the stores in the area.  She works every day caring for her little animals for about three hours per day however, when she has to sell the chickens, she sometimes works all day.  She tells us she has been in business for more than 15 years and things have gone well despite a few losses, but she has known how to continue forward.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy chickens, feed, and medicine so they will develop well.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es caminar por las \u00e1reas verdes y respirar aire puro que le brinda la naturaleza. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde su comunidad hasta los centros de acopio ubicados en la ciudad, lugar donde percibe mejores precios por sus productos. Su dificultad radica en no poder contar con suficiente ingreso econ\u00f3mico para solventar los pagos por adelantado a los jornaleros quienes le brindan el apoyo con las cosechas y desmonte de malezas; es por ello que acude a los pr\u00e9stamos que facilita la instituci\u00f3n MFP. Pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es sembrar m\u00e1s plantas de caf\u00e9 ya que cuenta con terrenos sin cultivar. Este ser\u00e1 su cr\u00e9dito numero 01 con MFP, sabe que si lo paga a tiempo, podr\u00e1 acceder a otro pr\u00e9stamo con mayor tranquilidad. Con los 1,500 nuevos soles; contratar\u00e1 jornaleros para que lo apoyen en las cosechas de caf\u00e9 y deshierbo de malezas.\n\n\n","en":"Gloria, 25, is a very hardworking woman.  She lives in a rented house with her partner Silvestre, 33, and her two beloved children, Cresly, 7, and Eli, 4, whom she wants to give greater well-being.  Gloria and her partner are the pillars of their children because Gloria's parents instilled in her from a young age how to dig in the dirt.  That is how she learned to work the land.\r\n\r\nToday she has five hectares of land planted with cacao plants.  During the harvest season she has the help of day laborers who are responsible for harvesting and moving the product to the drying areas.  What she likes most about her job is walking around the green areas and breathing the fresh air that nature gives her.  She considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products from her community to the distribution centers located in the city, where she gets better prices for her products.\r\n\r\nHer difficulty is not being able to have enough income to make the payments in advance to the day laborers who help her with the harvests and weeding.  This is how she came to the loans that the MFP institution facilitates.  Her greatest priority now is to plant more coffee plants because she has land for planting.  This will be her first loan with MFP.  She knows that if she pays it on time she will be able to get another loan without worrying.\r\n\r\nWith the 1,500 PEN she will hire day laborers to help her with the coffee harvest and weeding.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":977831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-12T22:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":164.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":170.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":179.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":183.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":189.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":197.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":204.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":210.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.04,"local_amount":164.45,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":169.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246250},{"amount":65.34,"local_amount":170.46,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":175.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386261},{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":179.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":185.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099353},{"amount":70.24,"local_amount":183.22,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:35Z","rounded_local_amount":189.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713499},{"amount":72.79,"local_amount":189.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":196.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202391},{"amount":75.74,"local_amount":197.57,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":203.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098072},{"amount":78.41,"local_amount":204.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":211.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400931},{"amount":80.65,"local_amount":210.4,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":217.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455447}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T04:38:14Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":383401,"name":"Neang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Neang is a 29-year-old married woman who has been living in Prey Chor district.
