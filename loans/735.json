The idea to start up this business came from her desire to stand out and help her husband with the family income. At the start, she only sold fizzy drinks and any profit she made she invests back into the business to buy more products. During this time she had a dream to have a shop, but one with a larger selection of goods. Just two years ago, with the help of EDAPROSPO she can see the profits, although she still dreams about a shop. Margarita\u2019s aim is to have a larger sale stand in a market, within a couple of years. But she knows that it will take at least a few years for her dream to become a reality.

She has three children: two sons, both of whom work, and one daughter, who is a school student.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago Dinara started her own business of cattle raising. She bought two calves and now these calves have gained weight and in fall she is going to have them sold or slaughtered for meat. She wants to expand her business and needs a loan to build a new yard for her cattle as the one she has at the moment is in a bad condition. This yard is not suitable for her cattle in wintertime and therefore she is taking precautionary measures now, so that she does not lose her cattle in winter.\r\n\r\nShe says that having a business apart from a regular job helps her be constantly active and motivated. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include Mairamkul, Gulyasyl, Kachkyn and Gulmira.\r\n\r\nMairamkul is a married woman aged 51. She owns a small shop and besides that makes national carpets. She needs a loan to rebuild her yard for her cattle and to increase its area.\r\n\r\nGulyasyl is a housewife.

All of her children have their own families, but she prefers to live independent of her children.\r\n\r\nKachkyn is the mother of four children and works in construction. At the same time she manages to breed cattle for which she has ten-years of experience. She has a pretty decent income and now needs a loan to purchase some more cows.\r\n\r\nGulmira also works at a construction site in the capital. She used to work as a masseuse. Then she bought some calves and started cattle raising. She wants to purchase some more calves to raise them for her son\u2019s wedding and then to resell the rest. \r\n\r\nAs can be seen, all the members of this group combine two or more jobs and that makes them even more passionate about their plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Her family lives in the home she inherited from her parents.  Her desire to succeed motivated her to work in several different places throughout the city.  At the moment, she manages two automobiles \u2013 one to use for public transportation and the other for her own personal use.  Maritza and her partner share the responsibilities of running their business in hopes that they will both reap the benefits.  However, their transportation service was not complete until they acquired some motorcars, which are operated by their children.  In addition to managing her business, Maritza also works as a cook at a convent in the mornings, a job that helps to supplement her income.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of Maritza\u2019s greatest wishes is to augment her transportation business by purchasing another automobile, since repairs and lost revenues due to mechanical failures have hurt her family income.  She is requesting her sixth loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA and hopes that the additional support will improve her financial condition.  The attitudes she developed working with her Communal Bank have helped her cope with her situation.

She is 54 and a widow who already has a grandson. Now she is an owner of a chemist\u2019s shop. The family budget enlarges with the help of a cattle-breeding business. Her son actively helps to run his mother's business. During the past two years, Ryskul has managed to buy furniture. In order to develop her business she needs to buy hay for cattle feeding. That\u2019s why she wants to get a loan. In the future, her plans include obtaining a new car. \n\nGulshat B., 36, is married. Her husband's profession is farming. Together, the couple has three children, all of whom are school pupils. Gulshat has chosen to work in the sphere of medicine; she works as a nurse in a hospital. But in order to cover family expenses, she has to earn money additionally by cattle breeding. Out of those proceeds, the family has managed to build a new house and to obtain a refrigerator and a washing machine. The loan's purpose is for stocking up hay for the winter. In the future, she is planning to buy a car.\n\nSaltanat U. has the status of the group\u2019s treasurer. She is 34 and a widow who has raised two sons by herself. Luckily, she gets material support from her brother and her older son. But after the big tragedy, her husband's death, she decided not to give up and she has opened a small shop. This business gives her 6000 soms per month. Moreover, Saltanat makes her bread by working as a mail carrier. She has managed to buy necessary household appliances: a clothes washer, a refrigerator and a vacuum cleaner. The loan's purpose is to increase cattle stock by obtaining more farm animals (2500 soms per animal). In the future, she plans to build a household room. \n\nShailogul T., 31, is married and her spouse is a farmer. Today, she raises money by taking orders at home and offering a sewing service. During the years of working hard, the members of the family together have managed to make house repairs, to buy a television set and a carpet. The loan's purpose is to obtain a sewing machine and stuff. Planning for the future, Shailogul wants to buy a kitchen set and a refrigerator. \n\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?\n\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Joyce joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joyce has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the sari-sari (general) store to save up for the future expansion of her business.

She is single and has two children who are 10 and 16 years old. They both go to school. Felicidade finished 9th grade but did not continue with school because of her pregnancy. She lives in a rented house with her children and takes care of her two stepmothers when she can.\r\n\r\nShe grew up with her 2 stepmothers because her mother abandoned her when she was a baby. Felicidade has never left the District. After her pregnancy she went to live with her husband; they are now separated. She managed to find a job as a Cleaning Assistant at the Secondary School in Namaacha. She works from 6:00 am until 2:00 pm, earning 2,600 meticais monthly which she uses for household expenses. She has been able to save 200 meticais in her bank account.\r\n\r\nFelicidade had a loan from BIM and then learned about Hluvuku through a co-worker who is also a customer of this institution. This is her second loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 15,000 meticais, which she will use to buy construction materials (sand, blocks and cement) to continue building her house. The first loan of 10,000 meticais was for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe is confident that she will pay off the loan ahead of time so she can take out other loans. In the future she intends to take out more loans to finish up construction and furnish her house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":777957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

There he formed his family together with Carmen, his wife of five years.  The couple have two children: Solange and Gabriel.  They care for their children in their own home.\r\n\r\n\"I just recently started out in this business and am still lacking a lot\" says the young, handsome Green who has a plot of farmland where he grows coffee, his only financial means of support.  Green's desire to work is incredible.  He is aware that in order to produce good-quality crops over vast tracts of land he must save up a lot and invest a lot of capital.  He is not discouraged.  His cheerfulness and vitality will help him to make progress and get ahead.  He already has three years experience and what he most enjoys about his work is getting rid of the weeds that grow between his coffee plants and also the harvest season.  This is when he sees his hard work rewarded when he sells his beans in the town of Pichanaki.  \r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the only work that Green does.

Todo este tiempo ha trabajado en la compra y venta de fruta de acuerdo a la temporada, y hay d\u00edas en que tiene que ir a las chacras a las 4.00am para comprar a los agricultores que ya tienen preparando sus productos para el mejor postor, por ello que Silvia tiene que madrugar para seleccionar las frutas y luego comprarlas. Para Silvia, a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s esta labor le parec\u00eda muy pesada, pero ya se adecu\u00f3 porque le es mucho m\u00e1s rentable, sobre todo en los meses de enero a marzo cuando vende frutas c\u00edtricas, luego viene la temporada de los pl\u00e1tanos hasta los meses de mayo, en este tiempo no va mucho a las chacras, solo espera comprar de los que llevan al mercado, llegando a vender solo de 20 a 25 javas de frutas, cada java consta de 12 kilos de naranjas o mandarinas. Mientras que est\u00e1 bien la demanda en el mercado la venta de frutas le sale el doble de ganancia, o de lo contrario busca vender paltas que son mucho m\u00e1s delicadas. Lo dificultoso en este negocio es que las frutas de malogran, y a veces se compra a un precio, y luego baja, entonces pierden parte de su capital; a pesar de estos altibajos, Silvia est\u00e1 feliz con su actividad porque le permite llevar una vida decorosa. Silvia hace uso de un cr\u00e9dito de MFP por la quinta vez consecutiva, todo este tiempo ha pagado con mucha responsabilidad todas las cuotas fijadas y jam\u00e1s cayo en morosidad. El dinero solicitado lo derivar\u00e1 a la compra de fruta por camionadas, para que de este modo las env\u00ede directamente a la capital, ya que ganar\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s que en su puesto y en un menor tiempo.","en":"Silvia is 33 years old and has lived with her common-law husband for 13 years.  They have three children and one on the way.  All this time Silvia has dealt in seasonal fruit, and there are days when she has to be at the farms at 4:00 a.m. to buy from farmers who sell to the highest bidder.  For this reason she has to be up early to choose the fruit and then purchase it. In the past this work seemed very burdensome, but she has become accustomed to it because it is more profitable.  In general she sells citrus fruit from January to March, then banana season runs until May.  During that time she does not go to the farms frequently, but waits to buy from those who bring 20-25 javas of fruit to the market. Each java is equivalent to 12 kilograms of oranges or tangerines. When demand in the marketplace is high, she makes double the profit from the sale of fruit. When it is not, she tries to sell avocados, which are more delicate. What is difficult about this business is that fruit spoils, and at times one buys at one price, but then it drops, resulting in a loss of capital. Despite the ups and downs, Silvia is content with her business because it permits her to lead a decent life. This is the fifth time in a row that Silvia has taken out a loan with Kiva, and each time she has made her loan payments and never fallen into arrears.  The money that she has requested will go towards the purchase of fruit by the truckload, because this way she can send it directly to the capital where it will earn much more in a shorter period of time than if she sold it from her stall.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":256549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fruit to send to Lima for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T14:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228399},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423634},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116902},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011824},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595417},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989658},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210788},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640417},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":307.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080081},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":307.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996401}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T16:10:59Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":88315,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a thirty-five year old married woman with two children.

She lives in her parents' home and greatly desires to get ahead in life.  She has raised livestock since she was small, which was always the business of her family.  Now she has her own livestock that she feeds well, because she knows that her earnings from their sale depend on the well being of her animals.  She has been doing this for 4 years, and what she enjoys the most is feeding the animals, feeling that she is giving them the care they deserve; the most difficult part is having to take her stock to the markets in the cities of Huancane and Jeliaca, which is where she sells her herds.  \r\n\r\nFor the future, she hopes to be able to increase her current herd in order to increase her income.

She operates two \"posho\" mills; one is in Kapsoya and another one is in Illuah, both neighborhoods within Eldoret.  Posho mills grind staple grains such as corn and wheat.\n\nElizabeth has been operating this business for the last fifteen years and from the profit she gets from her business, she has managed to educate her three children, and feed and clothe her family.  She has serviced four other loans from KADET and hopes with this fifth loan she will be able to repair and service her posho mills and offer better services to her customers who are also within Eldoret.\n\nIn future, Elizabeth hopes to diversify her business, buy a plot of land, and build residential houses for rental purposes.

Her family is comprised of her husband and her 2 children, with whom she lives in the house that she and her husband bought. For 10 years she has been selling beauty products thanks to the invitation of her friend, who motivated her to sell cosmetics. Ever since then, she has always tried to be the top seller of the month and deliver the products to her customers on time. They are in turn very happy with her customer service. She works in the business for the better part of the day because she has to constantly visit her customers to show them the new products. In so doing, she looks to add new customers who will increase their purchases and her income.  Clara is now planning to set up a small sales area in her house where she can sell beauty products because she has a big stock. She is planning on expanding her house in the near future so that she can open up a miscellaneous store because selling additional items will help her grow as an entrepreneur. She is new to the Microfinanzas PRISMA team, and she hopes to work responsibly within the institute because it is of interest to her to stay there to improve her business. The 1,500.00 PEN that she is requesting will help her purchase a display cabinet in which she can place her beauty products at home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

After finishing her studies, Carmen borrowed money from her parents to invest in a business selling school supplies. Her mother, who is a longtime member of the communal bank, invited Carmen to participate. During her time with FINCA, Carmen's sales have increased, because she can invest more money in her business, and she has learned to save. The loan she is now requesting will permit her to buy a photocopier and to stock her business with notebooks, pencils, pencil holders, drawing supplies and all types of useful products for the beginning of the school season. Carmen's dream is to have her own house and her own shop. \r\n\r\nVilma is married and has 3 children, aged 16, 22 and 24. The communal bank, has helped her learn how to save. She started a business selling clothes, and thanks to the loans she has received, she has been able to buy shelves. Now she also sells jewelry, gifts and perfumes, and she would like to take advantage of the school season and invest the funds from the new loan in school uniforms to sell. \r\n\r\nMariluz is single and has a 4-year-old child. She started a business selling cosmetics by catalog. She did not have much capital and did not receive support from any financial institution until a friend invited her to participate in the FINCA communal banks. Thanks to the loans, she has a little more capital, which she has invested in merchandise to sell, such as school supplies, hair clips, combs, mirrors and soaps. With the current loan, she will buy student lunchboxes and some educational games. Her dream is to have a large jewelry store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":485705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing merchandise such as school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-02-19T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3850,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orlanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gema Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1833.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":641.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":1833.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1840.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128943669},{"amount":1283.33,"local_amount":3666.68,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3681.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136671969},{"amount":641.66,"local_amount":1833.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1840.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144705884},{"amount":1283.35,"local_amount":3666.72,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T07:53:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3681.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152157854}],"funded_date":"2010-02-24T23:46:52Z","paid_date":"2010-07-17T07:53:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":179046,"name":"Belen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Belen S., 61 years of age, married, is a resident of Aquino, Tangub City.

At a young age she learned that work is an important part of her family\u2019s life and has been for many years.  By working she was able to earn enough capital to start a business from home.  Now that she generates good earnings, she has gradually made her business her primary activity.  What she enjoys most about her work is being able to converse with the neighbors who come by her store to shop.  Vilma says that everything she has achieved was a result of sacrifice and being able to stay at her store the entire day.  Over time she hopes to expand her facilities so that her customers will be more comfortable.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy products such as candy, soft drinks, bread,

Poblacion, Ginatilan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: BBQ food vending, coconut wine, and pig fattening. Her husband, Julito C. who is 39 years old, earns a living as a motorcycle driver. They have 3 children who are 7 to 12 years old. All are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nVilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,500 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more stock to sell so that she can continue to support her family's living expenses and save up for their future security. Vilma C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Glenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Glenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for family needs. Glenda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.

She lives in a four room house with her children. Emerencia joined GHAPE in 2009 and received a loan of 50,000 XAF, which was successfully repaid. The only problem that Emerencia faces in life is that she has to singlehandedly take care of her children since her husband died. She hates thinking of the deaths of her father, husband and son. She struggles to see that she takes care of the children her husband left behind, paying tuition fees, feeding them and catering to their health.\r\n\r\nEmerencia is requesting a loan to purchase Irish potatoes. She plans to buy five bags of potatoes at 23,000 XAF each and she will use 20,000 XAF from her savings to pay for the transportation of her goods to the Belo weekly market. She believes her business will succeed because there is a ready market and her prices are moderate, which would encourage customers. Any profits made would be used to pay tuition fees for her children. Emerencia prefers a loan from GHAPE because a lower interest is charged and repayment is gradual.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She is single and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Eseta owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Eseta has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 1000 Somoa Tala (WST) a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2010, Eseta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eseta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Eseta is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase sacks of fertilizers and gromozones. The loan will be the second loan taken out by Eseta from SPBD. Eseta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\n\nDear KIVA lenders, please take note that the dates in the client photo are wrong, it was totally a mistake made by our Loan Officers for not resetting the time, date and year of the camera, but the photos were taken within this month. I hope this won't happen again in the coming

He works long hours to ensure there is enough food for his children and grandmother, 2 of whom are going to school during the week and work in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. He has to wake up very early between 3am and 4am during the week, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for his children before they go to school because he could not afford any other means. However with little money he makes while working added to the pension money from his grandmother,which is not much, he is now able to afford to buy gas and paraffin both which are very expensive.He finds himself having to pay about R200 to R300 a month to have sufficient gas;money he hardly makes. Not only is gas expensive for Tanki and many like him, but it is highly flammable and when inhaled can lead to lung diseases even death. Tanki has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide Tanki and 14 other people from his village, who are living in the same circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

Before that, her family's income was mainly from farming. After joining the Fund, she discussed with her husband and decided to borrow money to purchase more cows and buffaloes to breed. After almost 10 years, her family now has a large number of cows and buffaloes. As she and her husband are both hardworking, their family's income is very stable. Their oldest child is also working and has stable income. Apart from the income from farming and breeding, her family also has additional income from her husband's horse-wagon transportation service. Therefore, her family's monthly income is always around 3 millions VND (about 193USD).

The main source of income for the business comes from selling beverages and frequently-used retail products. Anecita has been engaged in her business for more than 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nAnecita joined GDMPC this year to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to expand the business. This will be the first loan Anecita has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: dried fish, a general store and fish vending. Her husband, Ramon M., who is 63 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 10 children who are 23 to 39 years old. \r\n\r\nCarmen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Her previous loan of PHP 14,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nEpefania aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

After many years of work he had not been able to put up concrete in their house due to having to pay for the basics of food and school for his children.  His house was made of wood, because many years ago he worked in agriculture and then barely earned enough money for food.  With his savings he began to construct the house of concrete.

V. M., or \"Rossy\" as she is known in the neighborhood, buys and sells new and used clothing in her area. She goes to Guatemala City to purchase clothing at wholesale and then brings it back to Mazatenango where she can sell it at a markup. The new clothing will often fetch a 100% markup, while the used clothing does not do so well. She's considering dropping the used clothing line because of the low markup. Rossy is a member of the group of women \"Mujeres de \u00c1nimo\" and with this loan she'll invest in more new clothing for sale. She thinks she can get at least three dozen pants, three dozen blouses, and two dozen dresses with this credit. Her group is in their third cycle of credit. Rossy dreams of having her own place, instead of having to rent her current apartment, which costs about 700 Guatemalan Quetzales per month, or US$91.

She and her husband live in their own home with their three young children. Raymunda makes polo shirts for a living. At her dining room table, she traces patterns, cuts fabric pieces and sorts them. Raymunda does her best to cut every piece precisely, and then she takes them to her friend's shop, where they are sewn and finished. Her favourite part of her job is designing the shirts. She has been making shirts for two years; it's difficult work, and she doesn't have the right materials to continue doing it properly. In the future, she plans to buy a sewing machine and open her own clothing shop. This is her first MFP loan; she has agreed to make her payments on time, and considers it good for her business. Raymunda will use her loan to buy wholesale fabrics so that she can make more polo shirts and fill her orders on time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":529570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying fabric for making shirts.

a TV & Refrigerator repair shop, Farming and a General Store business. She lives in T. Alonzo St., Poblacion, Madredijos, Cebu City. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her TV & Refrigerator repair shop, Farming and General Store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP5,000. \r\n\r\nLydia is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she could use it to purchase additional materials for her business. This will be her 18th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lydia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nShown in photo: Lydia together with her husband in her shop. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives with his parents, and his greatest desire is to get ahead in life.  Abraham grows peas, potatoes, and corn, leaving the house early every day to work in his fields.  His only goal is to strive so that his crops will be good.  What he likes most about his job is caring for his land.  He has done this work for 6 years, and finds that the hardest part is protecting his land from infestation by the insects attracted to his crops.  In time, he hopes to sow more and thus have higher production.  This is his first loan with MFP.  He is aware that he must pay the installments punctually if he is to secure another loan.

She shares one room with her children  She lives in Elemighong, one of the  quarters found in Belo Sub Division, North West Region, Cameroon.\n\nBridget has encountered a lot of difficulties in life, for example, difficulty in having three square meals a day. Ill health has also been one of her problems, She has been unable to have good medical treatment because she has no money. She joined GHAPE because she  had heard and seen a lot of people testify about GHAPE and she believes her life will not be the same if this loan is given to her . \n\nBridget plans to buy a good quantity of castle oil(this is a medicinal oil used for the treatment of skin diseases and and also used as food). She is going to use the profit from the loan to increase her capital. Her community and family will benefit from the trade because she will provide them with castle oil at very low prices. Her activity will help reduce distance from members of her community and it will be available at all times. Bridget says \u201cher children will all be well educated\u201d.\n\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, and also that GHAPE does not ask for collateral security, and the because of the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan. GHAPE takes care of the poor and repayment is gradual. \n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":789732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy castle oil for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Elemighong Belo Sub Division","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Bridget ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":310454,"name":"Pao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pao, 39, is a married woman and the mother of four unmarried children.

He makes the milk into cheese, yogurt, butter, and other dairy products. His family helps him with sales and with caring for these generous cows because it is thanks to the income they generate that the family is able to satisfy its basic needs. <p>Oswaldo wants to improve the barn so that the cows can have a more comfortable place to live. In this way he can thank each one of them for the happiness they have provided his family for such a long time. For this reason, Oswaldo is requesting a loan of $100.00, which he is committed to repaying over a period of 6 months.

Usmonkul aspires to have more farming equipment and supplies so that he can work his land much more productively. Only due to lack of funds has he not been able to do so.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(second from left) is a hardworking mother of three who sells used clothing to make a living.  She sells what is called \u201cropa de paca,\" which is pre-made bundles of used clothing from the United States and other countries, organized into bags such as men\u2019s clothing, women\u2019s clothing and bedsheets.  Juana travels to cities up to five hours away from her home in Saman\u00e1 to purchase the clothing she sells to those in her neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nTeresa works from her home, where she lives with her husband and three children, ages 14, 10 and 4.  Her customers drop by with orders and requests, and Teresa happily finds the necessary clothing when she purchases inventory.  Currently on her eighth loan with Esperanza International, Teresa has proven to be a determined and responsible businesswoman.  Recognizing the oversaturation of some other types of businesses, she decided to enter into clothing sales, where she has found sales to be brisk.\r\n<p>\r\nMany of Teresa\u2019s profits go to feeding her children.  With five people living at home, her husband\u2019s salary as a boat driver is not sufficient to provide everything necessary for the family.  Now, with Teresa augmenting the family\u2019s income, all are comfortably fed and clothed.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Teresa dreams of having her own store from which she can sell her clothing and other goods.  As well, when her children reach college age, she hopes to support their education at a local university.\r\n<p>\r\nThank you for your Kiva loan to Teresa and the other members of her

The majority of the members are from the neighborhood of Narancay from the Ba\u00f1os parish in the City of  Cuenca.  Ba\u00f1os is known for its hot springs that emanate from a volcano.  There are festivals throughout the month of January with several activities such as dances and artist showcases and festivals featuring timbulo (a sweet tamale wrapped in corn leaf) and other foods.  Few of the inhabitants work in agriculture because, for the most part, they work serving the large quantity of tourists who come to get to know this beautiful place.\r\n\r\nThe members tell their stories with characteristic friendliness.  Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Natividad P. T. is a member of the Las Lucecitas bank.  She lives in Narancay, some 15 minutes outside the City of Cuenca.  She is 39 years old, married, and has 5 children, aged 18, 16, 14, 12, 1.  Her older children study in the Manuel C\u00f3rdova Galarza Technical College located in her parish.  She and her family live in their own home, the fruits of the efforts of Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda and her spouse.  Her husband is a carpenter, and he is the best life partner, as well as the best example for their children.  For 10 years Mar\u00eda has worked in agriculture, raising chickens, guinea pigs, and pigs.  The family consumes the majority of her output, and she sells a small amount in the free market in Cuenca, also selling chickens on foot, or plucked to acquaintances who buy in the house; she also sells them in the stores in her area.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan cycle with the foundation and she is grateful because they have helped stabilize her economically because before she had to borrow from informal lenders at very high rates of interest.  With the loan that the ESPOIR foundation is granting her, she will buy more chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, animal food and vitamins to continue to grow her business.  Her goal is to eventually buy a car in order to increase her sales and collect more customers. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Cristina Mej\u00eda P. is a new member of the communal bank.  Her mother-in-law is a member of the bank and invited her to become a member. She lives in the community of Guzho, some 15 minutes outside the City of Cuenca.  She is 23 years old, has been married for 5 years, and has two children: a 4-year old and a 2-year old.  Her husband is a driver in public transportation.  Maria is starting with the business of raising chickens.  She tells us that it is not too complicated, to obtain the desired earnings you just have to be attentive so that the animals do not lack food or water and have adequate shelter so that they do not die.  This is her first credit with the ESPOIR foundation and she hopes to continue to take out loans so that she can improve her quality of life and that of her family.  With this loan she will purchase more chickens, animal food and vitamins, and also she will use a part of the loan to finish her house.  The goal of Maria is to finish her house with the loans that the foundation grants.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Sindy Gissela Mor\u00e1n C. is another active member of the communal bank Las Lucecitas.  She lives in the City of Cuenca, is eighteen years old, and is married.  Although she has no children, she has a solid matrimonial relationship, telling us that in order to have a consistent relationship one must be friends above all and have excellent communication. Her husband is an electrician and they live in a rented home and would like to improve their economic situation.  Sindy sells shoes, she has been involved in this activity for a year and it's going very well because she has a good supply of good quality shoes.  She is an informal trader in the Cuenca free market, which runs daily.  She works from 8am to 6pm and on weekends goes to the markets in Sigsig, Azogues, and Paute where she works from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m.  This is her first loan, a friend convinced her to become part of the bank by telling her about the advantages that the foundation offers.  With the loan she is requesting she will buy more merchandise and this way will have an increased inventory of shoes for women, men and children.  Her dream is to have her own stall, so that she would not have to travel around the city to sell her goods.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Alicia M., 53, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for herself and her family. She finished a two-year secretarial course and is a proud mother of two children who are now in high school and elementary school. She is a single mother and gives all her best as a variety store owner to sustain their living. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlicia presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store that caters to needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocery in the community. Alicia has operated from home for five years now, and has gained regular customers who keep her business alive. She employs no one, and earns 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nBecause her goal is to level up her business, she decided to borrow 27,000 PHP. She will use this to buy goods that her customers prefer. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make hers their number one sari-sari store in the community.\r\n\r\nAlicia has learned the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. One most important goal she has in mind is to support her children until their college graduation, with which she will feel most fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAs CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship* meeting, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":703178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She and her husband Bejamine, who works as a vendor, have five children. She and Benjamine share the responsibility in attending to their young children while at the same time earning an income to provide for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nDarlyn is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is well-known egg snack that is sold on the sidewalk. It is a duck egg boiled with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes energy and strength. About 450 to 600 Balut eggs are boiled and sold every night. She and her husband not only prepare these eggs but also do the selling, which means they do not need to pay commissions to vendors to sell the eggs. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PhP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nDarlyn is requesting a loan amounting to Php 10,000 that she will use as start-up capital for her additional business, which will involve selling fried chicken skin and quail eggs. There is a high demand for fried chicken skin and Darlyn wants to give it a try since her stall is located in a crowded and busy area. The remaining amount will be spent on purchasing additional Balut eggs.\r\n\r\nDarlyn dreams of having a stall located in the market. She still has to wait a little longer to make this dream come true because she needs to prioritize being a mother to her young children. For now, Darlyn and her husband will continue to depend on to each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. \r\n\r\nDarlyn never fails to attend weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to go on with her life no matter what the obstacles might be, because she has faith in a God Who she believes will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":896776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional stocks of Balut and to add new food items to her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571877},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2881.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529427},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738643},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1440.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145871}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T19:06:35Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":351482,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 63 years old and is married to Thomas.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<P>The women of the Jorge\u00f1itas group come from the beautiful town of San Jorge la Laguna, a town located at the edges of the beautiful lake of Atitl\u00e1n.  These women reflect at first sight a confidence that calls your attention, so that while conducting the interview I was discovering the reason for this confidence.  \r\n\r\n<P>The great majority are artisans and they work making necklaces of jewels.  They produce beautiful earrings, bracelets, and necklaces with pearlites imported from the Czech Republic.  Some say that this art of making necklaces was imported to lake Atitl\u00e1n by European artisans several decades ago.  There are also women who invest their capital in small convenience stores and knitting machines.  They buy thread to create beautiful Guatemalan embroidered dresses and traditional blouses.  \r\n\r\n<P>When the artisans begin to share how they are going to invest their loans one can realize the dimension of their businesses.  The jewelers revealed that with the loan that they are going to receive they were going to buy the materials for the necklaces by the kilogram, while the great majority of artisans buy the materials for necklaces by the ounce.  This reflects that they are in a little more advanced phase of business development, since the quantity of commodity that they are going to buy is a lot greater than that of the majority of artisans around la Laguna.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Jorge\u00f1itas have been working with Friendship Bridge for more than a year and they have benefited from the training given by the loan agents.  The women commented that they were interested a lot in the themes of saving money, natural medicine and especially family planning.  They mentioned what a large impact it had on them to know that a woman is able and has the authority to plan the size of her family.  \r\n\r\n<P>Also they mentioned that they like to work with microfinance institutions, especially with Friendship Bridge, because they ask few requirements, the disbursements are fast and they help them with their business.  If you contribute to the success of these artisans then they are going to be able to continue developing their qualities as businesswomen and artisans.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Jorge\u00f1itas provienen del bello pueblo de San Jorge la Laguna. Un pueblo ubicado a las orillas del hermoso lago de Atitl\u00e1n. Estas mujeres reflejan a primera vista una confianza que llama la atenci\u00f3n, conforme fue transcurriendo la entrevista fui descubriendo el porque de esta confianza. \r\n\r\n<P>La gran mayor\u00eda son artesanas y trabajan elaborando joyas de mostacilla. Ellas producen hermosos aretes, brazaletes, collares con perlitas de mostacillas importadas de la Rep\u00fablica Checa. Algunos dicen que este arte de la mostacilla fue importado al lago Atitl\u00e1n por artesanos Europeos hace ya varias d\u00e9cadas. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentran mujeres que invierten su capital en peque\u00f1as tiendas de conveniencia y tejedoras que compran hilo para elaborar bellos huipiles Guatemaltecos, blusas tradicionales. \r\n\r\n<P>Cuando las artesanas empezaron a compartir en que van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito uno se puede dar cuenta de la dimensi\u00f3n de su empresa. Las joyeras revelaron que con el pr\u00e9stamo que van a recibir iban a comprar las bolsas de mostacilla por kilo, mientras la gran mayor\u00eda de artesanas compran la mostacilla por onzas. Esto refleja que ellas est\u00e1n en una etapa de desarrollo empresarial un poco m\u00e1s avanzada, ya que la cantidad de materia prima que van a comprar es mucho mayor al de la mayor\u00eda de artesanas alrededor de la laguna. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Jorge\u00f1itas han venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y se han beneficiado con las capacitaciones impartidas por las agentes de cr\u00e9dito. Las mujeres comentaban que a ellas les interesaron mucho los temas de ahorro del dinero, medicina natural y especialmente planificaci\u00f3n familiar. Ellas mencionaron que les caus\u00f3 un impacto grande el hecho de conocer que una mujer puede y tiene la autorizaci\u00f3n de planificar el tama\u00f1o de su familia. \r\n\r\n<P>Tambi\u00e9n mencionaron que les gusta trabajar con las instituciones de microfinanzas, especialmente con Friendship Bridge porque piden pocos requisitos, los desembolsos son r\u00e1pidos y las ayudan con sus negocios. Si ustedes contribuyen con el \u00e9xito de estas artesanas entonces ellas van a poder seguir desarrollando sus cualidades como empresarias y artesanas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":156513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To
