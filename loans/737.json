But there\u2019s nothing to compare to the paintings which are in most demand.  She earns from 120 to 150 soles per 1 meter x 1 meter painting and even more during Holy Week.  She enjoys what she does.\r\n\r\nEsther wants to set up a stand in her district\u2019s civic center but to do so she has to invest in the purchase of shelving, containers, and display cases as well as to rent the locale.  Esther is a faithful MFP client; she\u2019s been working in three cycles of group loans where she\u2019s done marvelously.  This would be her first individual loan and she states that she will be punctual with her payments like she\u2019s been to date.

Q. belongs to a village bank called \u201cBonanza.\u201d<P>\r\n\r\nHaydee earns her living making and marketing beautiful handicrafts (artesan\u00edas). The majority of her works are \u201ctejidos al telar\u201d which are crafts such as tapestries and carpets woven on a loom. Haydee says her specialty is in \u201cartesan\u00edas finas,\u201d which are very complex pieces stitched onto processed fabric. Together with her husband she owns a shop called \u201cQory Qayto,\u201d which is Quechua (their native language) for \u201cThread of Gold.\u201d Their clients, mostly foreigners, contract with them for specific projects which Haydee and her husband help design. The time it takes to complete one piece can range from one day for a simple tapestry to more than two weeks for large and elaborate orders.  <P>\r\n\r\nTo supplement their income and support their two children, ages 7 and 19, every Sunday Haydee prepares several dishes such as \u201cceviche,\u201d Peru\u2019s national dish of fresh raw fish soaked in lime juice, which she sells in the local market.

Aware of the needs of his family, Yuldosh requested and received a loan from IMON International a year ago. He used the loan to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer for his harvest.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their school was built in 1985 to help educate the children of Makeni city and its surrounding villages. The school has a total of twelve staff and 450 pupils.\n\nTeachers are one of the lowest paid workers in Sierra Leone. Because of this, many of them find other additional means of making a living. Some engage in businesses or agriculture and others organized extra classes for the pupils (though this is a practice the government is trying to abolish). Teachers therefore seek a loan in order to embark on meaningful projects and then, out of their monthly salaries, they gradually repay the loan.\n\nMabel C. (second from right) is a senior teacher at the school and head of this group. She is age forty-five. She was born in Matamp village in the Tonkolili district, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a teacher and they have four children together. One of her children is already a grown-up and training as a lab technician, while two others (the twins) are in Junior Secondary School III (JSS III) and the last is in JSS I.\n\nMabel has been a teacher for over twenty-five years now. She will use this loan to buy a piece of land for the purpose of constructing a house. Buying a plot of land will improve her life, she told me. With subsequent loans, and with the little she has and will be saving, she will be able to build her house. She needs a home for her children and for her old

In order to increase the stock of her materials and broaden her commercial activity, Rosine is asking for a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":561608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing condiments (peppers, onion, fresh tomatoes, crushed peppers, etc) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-06-29T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576231},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954745},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056400},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347935},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482962},{"amount":33,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":17482.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617778},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361154},{"amount":39,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20661.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779853},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":19911,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":21096.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401659},{"amount":8.18,"local_amount":4089,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4332.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089350}],"funded_date":"2010-06-29T14:51:27Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chlo\u00e9 Tuot","image":1210498}},{"id":215551,"name":"Maximiliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maximiliana de 61 a\u00f1os de edad, vive solo con sus hijos  Richard de 41, An\u00edbal de 23, Carlos de 39, y Revelino de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, pues es viuda.

After moving to the United States in the early '70s, Soo knew that, with her experience in the dry cleaning business, she would one day open up her own storefront. With the help of their two children, their dry cleaning business became a staple in their community.\r\n\r\nWith the economic recession, Soo\u2019s business suffered from increased prices. With increases in oil, supplies and energy resources, Soo was forced to increase prices in her store. However, with strategic cutbacks and determination, her business was able to keep its doors open. \r\n\r\nToday, Soo has her third loan with ACCION USA. This loan will allow her to buy a new dry cleaning machine. Without this machine, Soo was forced to send many of her clients to a different dry cleaning business. This loan will allow her to retain more of the clients that come into her store and offer more specialized services.\r\n\r\nSoo and her husband dream of eventually opening a dry cleaning business in Manhattan. With the confidence of having weathered the worst of the economic crisis, Soo is optimistic about their business\u2019s future. Soo says her greatest success with owning her own business has been sending her eldest son to a university in New York. \r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

He has an excellent location, surrounded by big state-owned and private companies, and on a main route where many people pass by on their way to the commercial centre. His idea for the business began 38 years ago, when he arrived in Barranquilla and started working for various companies. Eventually he responded to his independent streak and put into action his dream of having a small business preparing delicious natural orange juice. With this business he has succeeded in providing for his family and contributing, along with his wife, who is employed in domestic service, to the education of his three children who are now aged between 23 and 30. Above all, he has succeeded in keeping their own roof over their heads. Sixto's Kiva loan is his first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organisation that was recommended to him by a friend who is also a client of the field partner. With the money he will buy oranges and also raw materials, in bulk, for making fries, which he would like ot add as a new product in his range. At the same time he will pay off other loans that have become very costly. Sixto's main goal is to help his wife sert up a shop  in thier home, where she will be able to earn money for the family's expenses so she can become independent and not have to keep working as a maid. The main challenge in his business is inclement weather, especially when it rains. This reduces the number of customers and his sales, because as an outdoor salesman he has to take shelter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":610784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy oranges and ingredients in bulk for making fries, and also to repay a costly, informally arranged, debt.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-05T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto Tom\u00e0s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72317},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74726},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76158},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77618},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79105},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80622},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82167},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83742},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85347},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88198}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.71,"local_amount":147043,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":149211.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550783},{"amount":86.5,"local_amount":153776,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":156044.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427610},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":79105,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80271.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001031},{"amount":45.35,"local_amount":80622,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81811.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289042},{"amount":46.22,"local_amount":82167,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83378.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157192},{"amount":47.1,"local_amount":83742,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84977.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509072},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":85347,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":86605.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673299},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":88198,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89498.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319863}],"funded_date":"2010-10-06T17:53:33Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":240140,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana M. is a 47-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: renting out <i>trisikad<\/i> transport and a food-vending business.

Her husband works as a driver and helps her with household expenses, and her daughter also work and help with the bills. Maria is a merchant and at the same time has been making a living as a farmer for the past 30 years. The biggest problem she has is a lack funding, which doesn't allow her to get a good yield from her crops because she can't afford enough planting supplies. Maria's dream is to be able to expand her crops so she can better help her children and provide them with a better future. With the loan she is requesting she plans to purchase fertilizer and insecticide for her crops and hopefully achieve a better yield.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Delia owns & operates a business selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling vegetables to the local community.

Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used for working capital and to purchase additional inventory. Delia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

They live in a house belonging to a nephew. She is an older person but she has the will to improve, which is why she has decided to set up a food stall near the university in El Salvador. She gets help by her life partner to make the breakfast and lunch foods that are sold to the students at the university. It is hard work but it is the only source of income for their household and it is the way they are able to provide for all of their needs. This loan will be used to purchase ingredients such as rice, beans, corn, some vegetables, soft drinks, and snacks. They will also carry out some improvements to their small stand. It is made of aluminum sheeting and they want to expand the stall as their earnings grow.

He has been active in mixed farming for the past three years, producing and selling eggs, tomatoes and onions to the local market.\r\n\r\nJohn has requested a loan of 31,200 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This will be his second loan with Juhudi Kilimo.

With this experience, Merys began her business venture four years ago with a small amount of merchandise, distributing it on credit to her initial market of family, neighbors, and friends.  Gradually her growing clientele began to recognize her and ask her for clothing, small electric appliances, and so on, and from there she expanded her range a little.  At present Merys sells on credit in terms agreed upon individually with her customers; she recovers her money weekly, twice a month, and monthly, in accordance with each agreement.\n\nHer Kiva loan is her first funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Merys will buy curtains, fans, blenders, and merchandise that has been ordered, and with this investment she would be increasing her working capital.  Her long-term dream is to have a store for selling wholesale and, with her earnings, educate her son at a level of quality that fulfills her objective to help him be successful.  In the meantime, Merys is working on her business managing a liquidity of 16 to 1, or better said, for every 1 Colombian peso she has 16 in reserve, and, from this point, with the injection of working capital from her Kiva loan, she is planning her future growth.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":856348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy curtains, fans, blenders, and merchandise that has been ordered.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merys De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":98093},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":99973},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":101889},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":103842},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":105832},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":107861},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":109928},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":112035},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114182},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":116365}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":98093,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803771},{"amount":58.39,"local_amount":99973,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103827.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614841},{"amount":59.52,"local_amount":101889,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105816.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568795},{"amount":61.14,"local_amount":104668,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":108703.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780118},{"amount":62.87,"local_amount":107636,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":111785.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188513},{"amount":69.12,"local_amount":118329,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":122890.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324729},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":102538,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":106490.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038786},{"amount":81.76,"local_amount":139975,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":145371.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650948},{"amount":113.01,"local_amount":193469,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":200927.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140553},{"amount":2,"local_amount":3430,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3562.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100482}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T16:02:10Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":334415,"name":"Chenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chenda, 42 years old, is a housewife.

di ladang, sedangkan sekarang penjualan hasil pertanian turun drastic karena musim kamarau dan harga pupuk yang mahal. Oleh sebab itu Ni Nengah Weli berusaha untuk mendukung pendapatan suami dengan menjalankan usaha beternak babi. Namun usaha ini dijalankan masih secara tradisional dengan cara mengikat babinya pada sebatang pohon, hal ini dilakukan karena Ni Nengah Weli tidak mempunyai modal untuk membuat kandang. Kemudian Ni Nengah Weli mengajukan pinjaman ke Yayasan Dinari, karena selain mendapatkan pinjaman modal, Dinari juga memberikan pelatihan yang berkaitan dengan pemeliharaan babi agar nantinya mendapatkan hasil yang bagus. Modal pinjaman ini akan dipergunakan untuk membuat kandang babi dan membeli  pakan ternak sampai nanti babi ini siap dijual. Dengan adanya usaha ini diharapkan  dapat meningkatkan perekonomian keluarga dan anak \u2013anak mereka tetap bisa bersekolah. Sesuai dengan program Dinari bahwa pinjaman ini akan dilunasi setelah akhir periode pinjaman selama 6 bulan.","en":"Ni Nengah Weli a homemaker helps her husband in the crop field everyday, but recently income from the sale of crops dropped drastically due to the dry season and the high price of fertilizer.  Due to that Ni Nengah Weli make an effort to supplement her husband\u2019s income by carrying out pig farming.  However, this effort is still done in the traditional way where the pig is leased to a tree, the reason that this is done is because Ni Nengah Weli does not have the funds to build a pigpen.  Thus Ni Nengah Weli submit loan request from Dinari Foundation, because beside receiving loan, Dinari also provides training relating to proper pig farming so that later generate good returns.  This funding loan will be used to fund building the pigpen and purchase livestock supplies until the pigs are ready for sale.  With this effort hopefully will improve the family\u2019s financial condition and their children have a consistent education.  In line with Dinari\u2019s program this loan will be repaid at the end of 6 months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":228533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Build pigpen and purchase livestock supplies (Membuat kandang babi dan membeli pakan)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-11-25T19:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nengah Weli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":5000000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5023350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44434578}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T03:31:43Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:29:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pheng Tan","image":null}},{"id":79535,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa dama Luz N. desde hace varios a\u00f1os se ha destacado por ser una excelente costurera teniendo su establecimiento en el municipio de Ciudad Sandino en la ciudad de Managua.\n\nSe ha destacado debido a que ha aprendido a elaborar todo tipo de trajes as\u00ed como camisas, pantalones, blusas, etc. La situaci\u00f3n que hoy en d\u00eda ella est\u00e1 atravesando es que necesita el material de trabajo para continuar y este material es tijeras, hilos, telas, agujas, cent\u00edmetros, etc. Por esta raz\u00f3n espera que Ceprodel le beneficie con un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de estos materiales y para beneficio propio en su negocio.\n\n","en":"For several years Luz N. has been well known for being an excellent seamstress.

R. es un  joven se\u00f1or de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, soltero y vive  actualmente solo con su madre, su padrastro y sus dos hermanos.\n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a Jos\u00e9 Eduardo  a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nAsegura que su familia  se ha dedicado a esta actividad durante mucho tiempo, por lo que ha podido experimentar todos los cuidados que demanda, adem\u00e1s de la instrucci\u00f3n recibida por parte de sus familiares  a lo largo del tiempo. \nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que desea ser un microempresario exitoso y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a que su familia siga adelante esto es una de las cosas que lo motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero. \n\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Z. R. is a young gentleman of 21 years of age, single and currently lives with his mother, stepfather and two brothers. \r\n\r\nThe community where he lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita of Turrialba, Cartago Province. It is a small rural community of about two thousand inhabitants. They are engaged in milk production and coffee planting. It has an   irregular topography and is kept as a moist tropical forest. The community has very picturesque landscapes that combine the beautiful tropical forest gaps with coffee plantations and dairy farms.\r\nEl sauce is located about an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, the nearest trading center. However, several times a year the road becomes impassable due to the rains that hit the area. This is undoubtedly one of the main challenges for the community. When there were no activities many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or at banana plantations located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica. Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the neighbors look how to invest in projects in the same area and in this way avoid migration. \r\n\r\nAs part of the response to this situation, a cheese processing plant was established since two years ago. It is owned by the Milk Producers' Association of El Sauce, which motivated Jos\u00e9 Eduardo to start in milk production and sell it to this plant. \r\n\r\nHis family has been in this activity for long time, so he has experienced all the care it demands, in addition to the instruction given by their family members over time. \r\nThe cheese from the region where Jos\u00e9 Eduardo lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \"cheese type Turrialba\u201d. For the \"Ticos\" (as the people of Costa Rica are known), they love to consume this product, you'll find in the tables accompanying any kind of food. For this reason, the market for this product is really good. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo wants to obtain a micro loan of \u00a2 500,000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy a cow and be able to start his business and be a successful micro-business owner and help his family to keep going, this is one of the things that motivates him to strive and work very hard. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, one of 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan, and he hopes to continue to grow personally and financially. He also stays that with this type of organizations and facilitators of credit he can spend more time on productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Adriana Pierce, Kiva

Since she was 13 years old, she has dedicated herself to tending to her small grocery store, where she offers packets of snacks, sweets, drinks, and other products to settle her expenses since she works alone.  She likes the attention because it allows her to make friends and converse with the people that arrive at her grocery store.  Since she is located close to a well-traveled highway, many drivers and passengers stop to have a drink to refresh themselves and a sandwich to satiate their hunger.  Mar\u00eda considers her business to be profitable because she always has good clientele.  She thinks in the near future she will have a bigger store with essential products and in this way satisfy the growing needs of her clients.

Cuando tiene que cosechar sus propias siembras se levanta a las 3 de la ma\u00f1ana para cocinar los alimentos y posteriormente procede a la recolecci\u00f3n de las arvejas, para que en la tarde ya est\u00e9n listas para llevarlas al mercado de la ciudad, donde generalmente obtiene un buen precio, y eso la hace muy feliz y la motiva a seguir sembrando.

","en":"Do\u00f1a Nora, aged 37, is married and the mother of four children. They live in their own house. She is a very quiet and hard-working lady who has worked in agriculture since a very young age. Now that she is a mother, she has learned to organize her time and take care both of her home and her farm. \r\n<p>\r\nAs Nora works with her husband, they finish early and she has enough time left to work on her neighbors' farms, where she usually turns over the earth and harvests peas. She earns 13 nuevos soles (US$4.40) a day for this work, but she prefers to be paid depending on the amount of harvested peas, as this motivates her to pick as many peas as possible. When she has to harvest her own crop, she gets up at 3 a.m. to prepare the meals and then pick peas. In the afternoon of the same day, she sells her peas at the city market where she can usually get a good price for them. This makes her very happy and motivates her for a new sowing cycle.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She repaid her previous loans without difficulty and promised to do so also this time. In the meetings with her Communal Bank she patiently explains to her group members any topic which they might not fully understand, and they are grateful for this. Nora will use her loan to buy chemical fertilizers for her next crop of potatoes and peas.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":368890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T11:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.57,"local_amount":393.06,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":404.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734228},{"amount":2,"local_amount":5.72,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123997},{"amount":385.43,"local_amount":1101.22,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959582}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T15:02:10Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":132816,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene C. is from the village of Poblacion,Clarin,Misamis Occidental.

In the past, she has maintained an excellent repayment record. The loan consultant that has been working with Tatiana describes her as a hardworking entrepreneur with a fighting spirit. \r\n\r\nTatiana has a retail business in her community where she sells items such as clothing, household and health products, and facial treatments. After performing her daily domestic tasks, she dedicates six hours to her business from Monday to Saturday. Going door to door, she offers her clients various household products, clothing and cosmetics among other items. This loan will be used as working capital so she can buy clothing and facial treatment products.\r\n\r\nTatiana has been working in sales for the past ten years. In a good month, she can earn 500,000 colones; in a bad month, only 150,000. She says her main obstacle is fluctuations in demand. For example, because the schools open on February 10th, most Costa Rican families are spending money on school supplies for their children, rather than retail products. As a result, Tatiana\u2019s business takes a hit in February.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Tatiana worked as an administrative assistant while also running her sales business. Recently, she has decided to dedicate all her energy to her business, because it allows for a more flexible schedule. As her own boss, she can allocate the hours of the day she needs for domestic tasks and taking care of her children, while allotting other hours for her sales activities. \r\n\r\nTatiana hopes to combine her increased investment of time with the money from this loan to increase sales and expand her business. By the end of the year, her goal is to buy a car, which would allow her to expand operations further and facilitate her daily activities. Some of Tatiana\u2019s long term goals are to buy a house and be able to invest in a university education. Tatiana would like to study business administration with a concentration in marketing.

Very young and having no one to support him, he opened up a stall with 50,000 francs that he had saved up by selling bread. His sales amount to 15,000 to 25,000 francs a day. His strategy is to get up early and buy warm bread from the bakery, then go from door to door, calling out his wares, in the back streets of his community. At 8 am he opens his kiosk where he sells the remaining loaves of bread and other foodstuffs. \r\n\r\nWith the loan that he is counting on receiving, he is going to buy cartons of powdered milk such as \"la belle Hollandaise\" and \"Nido\" milk, a sack of 50 kg of sugar, tinned foods, and various detergents and bath soaps. \r\n\r\nHis ambition is to open up a real grocery store, to get married one of these days, and start a family.

But because limited availability of funding, such activity were not carried out well, until the emergent of the idea of forming pig rearing groups with the hope that being together in a group thus able to have the opportunity to expend activity funding from parties are interested with the existence of small business.  The name \u201cPigy Lestari\u201d (Eternal Pigy) was finally selected as the name of the group with 11 members, with Ni Komang Ratiani as the leader.  After the group Pigy Lestari was formed the members submit a start-up loan application with DINARI, whether for capital funding or veterinary assistance.  From each funding they attained, will be used to purchase piglets, mother pig and also feed and supplies.  Income from the sale varies depending on market situation.  Gain is usually greater during religious celebrations because demand for pork is high thus increasing the price of pork.  From 1 piglet alone, the net gain is approximately Rp 400.000, - after rearing for 6 months.  Each gain will be use to supplement the families financial needs.  All members of the Pigy Lestari group hope the start-up funding from DINARI will further advance their business also able to develop.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nMemelihara ternak babi merupakan hal yang biasa dilakukan oleh ibu-ibu yang tinggal di dusun Sumbersari. Tetapi karena keterbatasan modal, usaha yang mereka tekuni ini tidak bisa berjalan dengan baik, sehingga munculah ide untuk membentuk kelompok peternak babi dengan harapan bahwa setelah tergabung dalam sebuah kelompok maka mereka akan memiliki peluang untuk mengusahakan modal usaha dari pihak lain yang peduli dengan keberadaan usaha kecil. Nama \u201cPigy Lestari\u201d akhirnya dipilih sebagai nama kelompok mereka dengan jumlah anggota seluruhnya 11 orang,yang diketuai oleh  Ni Komang Ratiani.\r\nSetelah kelompok Pigy Lestari ini terbentuk maka mereka mengajukan permohonan pembinaan kepada DINARI baik itu dalam permodalan maupun pendampingan oleh dokter hewan. Dari setiap modal yang mereka peroleh, itu dipakai untuk membeli bibit penggemukan, penginduk dan juga stok pakan untuk ternak mereka. Hasil penjualan yang biasa mereka peroleh cukup bervariasi berdasarkan situasi pasar. Keuntungan tertinggi bisa mereka peroleh menjelang hari-hari besar agama karena biasanya kebutuhan akan daging babi cukup banyak sehingga hargapun juga meningkat. Dari satu ekor penggemukan saja keuntungan bersih yang bisa diperoleh sekitar Rp  400.000,- setelah dipelihara selama 6 bulan. Dari setiap keuntungan yang diperoleh ini mereka pergunakan untuk membantu mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga. Semua anggota kelompok Pigy Lestari berharap pembinaan yang mereka peroleh dari DINARI  bisa berlanjut terus sehingga usaha mereka juga bisa berkembang."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":123083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Hace varios a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s estuvo trabajando como chofer de motocarro y autom\u00f3vil, haciendo servicio de transporte interurbano en la ciudad, pero exactamente hace 2 a\u00f1os se compr\u00f3 su motocarro para realizar servicio a domicilio, este trabajo le es muy rentable, ya que al d\u00eda, descontando todos los gastos, gana entre 40 a 50 soles diarios. David inicia su labor a las 6:00am hasta las 8:00pm. En esta \u00e9poca, debido a que los alumnos est\u00e1n de vacaciones, no le es muy rentable trabajar con su moto, entonces cree que mejor ser\u00e1 alquilar su motocarro hasta que mejore la plaza, mientras tanto trabajar\u00e1 como guardi\u00e1n de una cochera de unos familiares, los cuales le dar\u00e1n un sueldo fijo, y m\u00e1s el alquiler de la moto tendr\u00e1 lo suficiente para cubrir sus gastos.

Currently he is living in his in-laws home, until he can save enough money to build his own house. A few years back he worked as a motorcycle taxi and car chauffer providing intercity transport. Exactly 2 years go he purchased his own motorcycle taxi to provide a delivery service; this job is very profitable for David, given that daily, after discounting costs, he earns between 40 and 50 soles. David begins his workday at 6:00am and ends at 8:00pm. During this time of year, due to the fact that students are on vacation, it is not very profitable for him to work with his motorcycle, which leads him to believe that it would be better to rent out his motorcycle taxi until the main square improves. In the meantime he will work as a security guard at the garage of some relatives who will provide him a fixed salary. This salary and the money he will earn from renting out his motorcycle will provide him with enough to cover his expenses. David believes that if he does not work on his motor taxi the parts will breakdown, for which he sees most convenient to rent out his motor taxi until demand improves and he takes up his job again. When David requested his first loan with the Microfinanzas PRISMA bank he committed himself to pay all his quotas, and he has done so up to date when he is his sixth loan.  The money David has requested will serve to purchase a taxi operation permit from the municipality, and with the rest he will purchase tires for his vehicle. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":255131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a taxi operation permit and tires for his motor taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T21:20:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:54Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228385},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423620},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116888},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011810},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595403},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":126.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989644},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":252.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210782}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T04:27:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":87743,"name":"Chea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chea C. has been growing rice for a long time and she is very skilled at rice farming.

Raufshon cycles a relatively small amount of money in his business; that is why, he decided to obtain a loan from MicroInvest to expand his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":289708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T02:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raufshon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":48.92},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":52.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":15.08},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.68},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.31},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.08,"local_amount":45.23,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":56.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120874},{"amount":15.68,"local_amount":47.04,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":58.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36016026},{"amount":16.31,"local_amount":48.92,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":61.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599753},{"amount":16.96,"local_amount":50.88,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-26T07:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994195},{"amount":17.64,"local_amount":52.91,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":66.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215475},{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":55.02,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":68.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644967}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T03:00:18Z","paid_date":"2009-10-10T10:29:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vasilisa Budnikova","image":387310}},{"id":100031,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u0129nh 51 tu\u1ed5i , gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 4 con trong \u0111\u00f3 c\u00f3 1 con \u0111ang \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

Lleva realizando este trabajo por 3 a\u00f1os y le esta yendo muy bien. Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es que le permite tener tiempo libre para poder realizar muchas actividades mientras que sus motos generan ingresos adicionales, cuando empez\u00f3 s\u00f3lo tenia un mototaxi y ahora esta aumentando cada vez m\u00e1s, menciona que lo malo de este negocio es que sus veh\u00edculos se maltratan mucho ya sea por el mal trato de los choferes o por las malas condiciones de las calles de la ciudad, pero bueno es un riego que asume en este negocio, ahora se prepara para poder seguir aumentando su flota, pero primero desea refaccionar bien a sus cuatro unidades.

She lives with her spouse and they have two children who are 7 and 3 years old.  She owns her house where she shares with her spouse the joy of educating their children and providing the best for them.  Besides them, her father lives there too.\r\n\r\nMelita\u2019s work consists in leasing out a mototaxi.  Starting very early she rises to await her four drivers who take the mototaxis to work providing transportation services.  She leases out the mototaxis and earns profits for each one of them.  She\u2019s been in this business for three years and is doing very well.  What she likes about the work is that it leaves her with free time to do many activities while her mototaxis generate additional income.  When she started out she only had one mototaxi but now she\u2019s increasing more each time.  She mentions that the bad thing about the business is that the vehicles are damaged quite a bit due to the poor way the drivers treat them or because of the poor condition of the roads but it\u2019s a risk one must assume in this business.  Now, she\u2019s getting ready to be able to enlarge her fleet but first she wants to service her four existing units.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first MFP loan and she is very happy to know that she\u2019ll be getting financial support because she feels she can advance with her business.  On the other hand she commits to be a good, punctual member of her communal bank.  She hopes to fit in quickly in the communal bank she belongs to because she wants to be very responsible always and not disappoint anyone.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 800 soles to buy another mototaxi since she\u2019s been saving up all this time and has about 100 soles and all she needs still is the amount she requested to be able to have the rest she needs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":920369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy another mototaxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-20T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":126.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":131.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":132.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":141.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":146.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.13,"local_amount":120.34,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":122.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622034},{"amount":47.62,"local_amount":126.99,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:07Z","rounded_local_amount":128.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836127},{"amount":49.4,"local_amount":131.73,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":133.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245891},{"amount":49.74,"local_amount":132.65,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:18Z","rounded_local_amount":134.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385920},{"amount":53.1,"local_amount":141.59,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":143.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099007},{"amount":55.01,"local_amount":146.7,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":148.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713154}],"funded_date":"2011-11-20T13:45:08Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":363156,"name":"Ines","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"In\u00e9s, es una mujer joven de 21 a\u00f1os convive junto a Faustino de 30 a\u00f1os; ambos viven en casa propia y desean tener un buen futuro.

She also has as a goal improving the location of her business and making improvements to her home; this is her dream of prosperity.\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is making a bigger production line more efficient, because she doesn\u2019t have the machinery required to do so and the space where she works is very small.  Even so, she will face up to this situation with her great creativity.  For now she is focusing on increasing the production capacity and organization of her businesses.  This is exactly why she is turning to a Kiva loan, her first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan she will buy wheat flour, plastic trays, cheese, and guava paste.  She will also invest in footwear for orders from her customers.

She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg production, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will further increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she intends to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. \n\nIn addition to profits, Stellah will benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer.

She also plans very soon to set up another store out of her home to sell clothing.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Graciela G. es separada, tiene 47 a\u00f1os y tiene 5 hijos, 2 varones y 3 nenas.<p>\r\n\r\nMaria Graciela desde hace 12 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta ambulante de ropas, esta fue la forma de ganar un poco de dinero para mantener a sus 5 hijos.

She lives in her mother\u2019s house with her two children, aged 6 and 14. Eight months ago, she started a store in her house, as she noticed that it was in a good central location. \r\n<p>\r\nSince that time, she has seen the fruits of her labor. She and her children attend to the customers who come in for the foods that they sell. She only works in the mornings, as in the afternoons she is busy with housework and care of the children. She is very satisfied with the business, and feels constant personal growth. She plans to pursue this business until it becomes a large-scale food distribution.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Helvia\u2019s third loan with MFP, and she is happy to be part of a communal bank. The money from this loan will be used to buy more merchandise for her store, especially \u201cpanetones,\u201d traditional Christmas cakes. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":436603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-27T23:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":313},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":309}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734862},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":315.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124186},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959927},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":315.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992771},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717559},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":315.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751237},{"amount":109.55,"local_amount":313,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":315.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933794},{"amount":108.15,"local_amount":309,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":311.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672696}],"funded_date":"2009-11-28T02:23:56Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":161740,"name":"Maywah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maywah P. is a 39-year old married woman who lives in the village of Cross Catalvas, Maquiling, Sagay City, Negros Occidental.

She married in 1982 and had an excellent example of a close-knit family. Unfortunately, in 2006 her husband died of cancer and Childekan became the only bread-winner for her children. It was a very hard blow for the family, however, Childekan braced herself to make her children\u2019s lives stable.\r\n \r\nFor many people in rural areas, cattle breeding is the main means of subsistence. Childekan took on this activity, which had been started by her late husband. Her success was achieved due to hard work and strong efforts. Childekan managed to increase the number of cattle but had to sell them in order to pay for her children's education. In their own way, her son and daughter do their best to help Childekan in the household. \r\n\r\nNow Childekan is applying for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase one horse, sheep and bull calves for fattening and reselling. With the revenue from the loan, she plans to pay for the next year of her children's edcuation. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.
