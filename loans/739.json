He is married with 4 children who are all school-going. He buys the clothes in bulk from Nairobi and transports them to Kisumu for retailing. He has been in this business for over 5 years now. One of his primary motivations for choosing this business is because of the readily available market due to the high poverty levels in Kisumu town.\r\n<p>\r\nHe buys his stock every 2 weeks and sells the clothing not only in Kisumu Town but also in neighboring markets on the outskirts of Kisumu. He goes to these markets on their specific market days.\r\n<p>\r\nThe post-election violence in Kisumu Town affected him negatively as it meant he couldn\u2019t sell his clothes for quite sometime. There was, however, an opportunity for him as well in this situation since most people now can\u2019t afford to buy new clothes and have to rely on second-hand clothes for survival. He hopes to take advantage of this opportunity by taking a refinanced loan to enable him to carry on with his earlier business. His business had been making profits before the violence enabling him to frequently restock his business and pay his loan as well. His loan repayments have been on schedule and so have been the group repayments.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has been the secretary for his group and has done a good job particularly in ensuring that the group has its loan balances kept intact. The group has also been cohesive and with good repayment rates before the post-election violence. They see the refinancing as an opportunity to get back to their normal business state as soon as possible.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to being cohesive, the group has had good repayment rates in earlier loans and have been having timely meeting on their rescheduled meeting days. Solomon, in addition to his secretarial duties, has played a huge role in energizing the group through constant faith-based encouragements during the violence period.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nDisclaimer: Kiva is working with OI-WEDCO to refinance businesses disrupted by Kenya's post-election violence.  The group above has received loans from OI-WEDCO in the past and is now working to rebuild their businesses and to get back on their feet. Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses. Lenders to this entrepreneur should be aware that this loan may represent a higher default risk, and should be willing to accept this additional risk in making their loan.<\/i>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":146114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To reconstruct and expand businesses after post-election violence","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisumu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.1 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":92,"posted_date":"2008-04-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dennis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joanes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jared","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joab","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dems","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-19T13:32:28Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":205000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":34166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":343,"local_amount":21307.58,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T03:23:49Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":21368.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201923},{"amount":757,"local_amount":47025.76,"processed_date":"2008-06-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":47161.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":242797},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271857},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301114},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331859},{"amount":550,"local_amount":34166.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:47:26Z","rounded_local_amount":34265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365941}],"funded_date":"2008-04-05T13:32:28Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T04:47:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":47263,"name":"Martina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martina is twenty-five years old and a buddimg entrepreneur.

This is 27-year-old Grace D. from Tukuyu. She is single. Grace has been running a \"genge\" business since 2005. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>\r\n\r\nGrace works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Grace currently earns about 300 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase sugar, rice beans, cooking oil,chili, and and other items for her business. In the future, she plans to increase the variety and quantity of her inventory. Grace thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":256315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":319926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To cultivate Irish potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T13:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam\t  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":301837.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773301}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T15:07:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":112819,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel S.

They are street vendors and Juana works Saturday, Sunday and Monday and her husband everyday.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to invest in the business since they are in need of several things.  She cannot specifiy quantities becaught it depends on the price of each item and whether it is purchased wholesale or retail.\r\n\r\nThe problems they run into are when plaza business owners make sales difficult or when sales are slow and they cannot even earn enough to cover their transportation.  But this does not mean that they do not have a goal which is for their children to finish their education.  They also want to set up a stand somewhere in the community or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you to FRAC and KIVA for this loan which will help me get ahead.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":885294,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy leather aprons and bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T10:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2014.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618952},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2014.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573197},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2014.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784909},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2014.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193477}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T10:18:50Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":347257,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita is married with five children, two of whom are in school.

She is married to a driver and has a 32-year-old child. In 2006, Fatu established her cooking utensil business after dropping out of school due to the lack of financial support from her parents. Women were not encouraged to further their education at that time, so her alternative was to start doing business. She started trading in local produce and was able to save 40,000 SLL which she used to purchase household utensils to sell from home.  Within the year, she rented a stall in town and last year she was able to rent a shop to display her stock in larger quantity.  Fatu works 11-hour days seven days a week and earns about 1,000,000 SLL each month. Her major business challenges are transportation costs and foreign exchange. \r\n\r\nFatu is requesting a 4,000,000 SLL loan to purchase pans, flasks, drinking buckets, stoves, food containers, and iron charcoal. She has successfully repaid a previous loan. Fatu hopes that her loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 300,000 SLL. In the future, she plans to build a house and a store outlet to have her own business premises. Fatu thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":902965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase utensils, stoves, and home products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-10-29T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:24Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244513970},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721799},{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124705},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505612},{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:55Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974719},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815289},{"amount":115.63,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444350},{"amount":115.62,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":508981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537083}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T23:57:10Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":355462,"name":"Twisungane Rgt Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fabien fait partie du groupe Twisungane Rgt.

She has 7 children, none of which live with her. Before he died, her husband worked in a cement factory, and, with the help of some day laborers, he farmed in his spare time.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband died, Maria began a small business of selling clothing. With much hard work and enthusiasm she travels to nearby villages every Friday, Saturday and Sunday to sell her wares. The rest of the week she stays home to attend to the garden her late husband had prepared.\r\n\r\nShe has been successful in selling clothing in the nearby villages. This experience has allowed her to grow her business, and to gain very valuable business experience. Every two weeks Maria travels to Lima to buy her clothing for resale. She takes advantage of this trip to visit with her children who live there. They also give her advice about what clothing to buy depending on current tastes.\r\n\r\nThis will be the eighth loan Maria is requesting from MFP. She has shown responsibility and promptness in repayment of the previous loans, and she is an active member of the organization. The funds requested will be used as working capital, to allow her to buy merchandise for resale in the countryside.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by William Farren, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":290821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Working capital - buying clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":6.4,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595822},{"amount":254,"local_amount":793.75,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":803.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640730},{"amount":539.6,"local_amount":1686.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1707.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080203}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T18:12:55Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"William Farren","image":null}},{"id":100547,"name":"Marcos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Marcos P. y su esposa tienen un hijo, quieren darle lo mejor.

With the requested money he will buy tubes to supply 50 people, who need this useful element on a daily basis,  with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":420331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase tubes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-04T21:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eleuterio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":222.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":223.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":232.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":244.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":256.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":260.87},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":276.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":283.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.85},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.9},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.85,"local_amount":222.44,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":226.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843153},{"amount":156.08,"local_amount":445.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":454.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734731},{"amount":3.61,"local_amount":10.31,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":10.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124093},{"amount":85.46,"local_amount":244.17,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":248.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959796},{"amount":89.9,"local_amount":256.86,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":261.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992642},{"amount":91.31,"local_amount":260.87,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":265.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717426},{"amount":96.65,"local_amount":276.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":281.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751183},{"amount":99.14,"local_amount":283.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":288.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933738}],"funded_date":"2009-11-05T00:51:26Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":153973,"name":"Roque","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Roque M. is from the town of Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

She is married and has 3 children.  All of her children are currently in school.  Claire runs a small eatery, which she has had for 2 years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Claire has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more saucepans and stock food.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Claire hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food and school fees.  In the future, Claire hopes to own a big restaurant. Claire is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by managing to provide the home needs in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: \r\n\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":586803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in District 1, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her frozen foods business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 11,000. Christina is borrowing PHP 13,500 to continue to fund the operations of her frozen foods business. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Christina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The city of Manta is known for its beautiful beaches, which are visited by many domestic and foreign tourists during all seasons of the year. On the shores of the Pacific Ocean, it is one of the most important ports in Ecuador and in the Americas.\r\n\r\nIn this place, we meet Ingrid, who is 37 years old and married. She and her husband have two children, aged 17 and 10. The older one is starting at the university this year, and the younger one is in school. Her husband is a master builder. \r\n\r\nIngrid has a small grocery store, and she also sells Esika products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and accessories for women). She sells all of her products in the same store. She works every day from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. She buys the products in Manta, and some of them are delivered to her store.

She also participates enthusiastically in the activities organised by the Fund. After 6 years of borrowing to invest in buying and renting tractors and other farming equipments to meet the demand of the people around the area, her family's economy has improved. Apart from renting, Mrs. Ngoc also sells general goods in the market to increase her family's income. She has just built a new house and is able to send all her children to school. This time, she would like to borrow 15,000,000VND (900USD) to purchase more tractors and ploughs to rent out.

She lives at home with her parents and helps with the household expenses.  She is eager to excel in life, which is why she works extremely hard.  Since she devotes her time to raising livestock, Rosio starts her day at 5am when she takes her animals out to graze.  She handles her work with much love and dedication.  Rosio knows that good breeding and proper nutrition result in better profits when it comes time to sell her animals.  What she likes most about her job is walking through the vast fields where her cattle graze.  This property was given to her by her parents in order to start her business.  She has been engaged in livestock breeding for one year and believes the hardest part is taking her cattle to the city of Puno when it is time to sell them.  Rosio hopes to increase the number of cattle she has in order to generate more revenues so that she can open a butcher shop in the future.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Rosio\u2019s second loan with MFP.  She wants to make her payments on time so that she can qualify for more loans in the future to improve her business.  Rosio knows that her Communal Bank will support and guide her.  With her loan of 800 soles, she will purchase fodder in order to feed her animals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":379505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fodder for her animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":135.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081272},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":135.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997423},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":135.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842768},{"amount":137.84,"local_amount":401,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-23T12:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":408.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734345}],"funded_date":"2009-09-01T17:43:15Z","paid_date":"2010-01-23T12:26:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":137478,"name":"Mary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary N. is the chairperson of her group in Katosi.

She gets up early before she goes to work in order to prepare lunch for her husband who is a driver and her son who is in school. Her work is not very hard but she still would like to have her own business. It is with this goal in mind that they bought a car, which the husband hopes to drive for work. To this date they have paid the loan on this vehicle. Rossi hopes that her house will get electrical service. She would like to sell ice cream, fruit and sodas from her house. She would be able to save her earnings to use to build improvements to her house and in this way improve their lives. This is her sixth loan from MFP. One more time she promises to pay her loan payments. Also she would like to say that she gets along well with the members of the community group. With the loan that she is asking for, she will finish paying the payments on their car. If they finish paying off their loan they will receive documents which will allow them to work without problems from the ministry of transportation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":511713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To pay off the loan for their car and thus obtain the documents necessary to use the car for work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718194},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751869},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934328},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673096},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886926},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":335.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153929}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T18:15:18Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":191550,"name":"Saranhuu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saranhuu is 43 years old and lives with her husband and four children in Hovd province, Mongolia.

She lives in Upper Cambanay, Brgy. Cambanay, Danao City, Cebu City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable and now earns an average monthly income of PHP4,000. Arneledie is now borrowing PHP 18,000 so that she  can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 8th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Arneledie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

In spite of the fact that he has to start working very early in the morning, Carlos is trying to continually grow his business so that he can help with his household expenses.\r\n\r\nCarlos has requested a loan for 1,700 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa.  He will use this money to improve the bathroom facilities in his home so that he can provide better safety and cleanliness for his family.  With a lot of effort and hard work, Carlos tries to provide his family with some comforts and continues trying to get ahead in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":768637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a common family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her stall's regular customers are her neighbors in the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as a result.  \r\n\r\nCarolina hopes to open another store in their area and dreams of being able to give her child a high quality education through her hard work.

When he arrived from his homeland Ancash he didn't have an occupation.  This provides him with an income to feed his family whom he loves very much.  He also has plans to plant a botanical garden of medicinal plants on his small plot of land.  \r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan with MFP.

Paska is a married woman with eight children. Her children are well mannered, and she works very hard to bring them up morally, intellectually and spiritually.\r\n<p>\r\nShe came to Kampala during the difficult times in 1997 when the Northern Uganda conflict made it unsafe for her family to stay. She took refuge in Kampala and eventually relocated to Acholi Quarter. While in Kampala, hard work is a part of her life. She started doing what she could to earn money for her family by selling sugar-canes and breaking stones. She eventually acquired her own pit and was able to earn more through dedication and hard work.\r\n<p>\r\nPaska's luck soon changed when she was introduced to Life in Africa. She joined and quickly started learning how to make paper beads. This brought a wonderful change in her life. She started earning more money, which was used to feed her family, pay for her school fees, and other necessities.\r\n<p>\r\nPaska dreams of constructing a permanent family house in the village.

the tropical Santa Cruz region of eastern Bolivia. Their first loan having gone well, the group now wants to take out a second one, confident that they will continue to work well together. The group says that both the responsibility and the desire to work hard are helping them to develop their small businesses and support their families. Several of the women are teachers who have businesses on the side providing additional income to improve the lives of their families. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses: Noel, Luis and Julio all drive taxis or motorcycle taxis; Raquel owns a copy shop; Teresa, Lucia, Liliana and Celia sell clothing and underwear; Cecilia sells bread; Nancy and Celia sell prepared meals, while Maria Noemi sells Yambal cosmetic products and Rodolfo runs a body shop. Most of the group members plan to use their Kiva loan to purchase more merchandise to sell, supplies for their businesses, or ingredients to make meals.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group's president, Rosmeri B., is thankful for the support that AgroCapital has offered the group.

He and his wife Hilda live in their own home and they have 8 adult children.  They have been able to support their family throughout the years by cultivating potatoes, peas, beans, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulloco<\/a>.  In addition, they raise dairy cows so that they can obtain 3 to 4 buckets of milk each day to produce their rich cheeses, which are well-known among customers for their flavor.  They sell their products in Lima every 2 weeks.  Gaudencio already has regular customers in Lima, which is why he prepares between 40 to 60 blocks of cheese so that he can fulfill his orders.  He sells the rest of his cheese in Tarma at the \u201cDos de Mayo\u201d (May 2) Market, where products are sold at retail.  Gaudencio is very happy with all of his business activities, since they enable him to provide for all of his necessities.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Gaudencio\u2019s ninth loan with MFP.

Together with her husband, she has been able to start her own business, a small hardware store where she sells a variety of products. For the past five years, she has run the business herself, because her husband works as a manager for a private transportation company. Thanks to her husband's help, for instance with supplies of paint and iron goods every two weeks that provide her with materials, she has been able to increase her capital. With this loan, she would like to purchase cement, iron, paints, ceramics, and wire, which are the best-selling products. When these items are out of stock, her customers go to the competition; this is not good for her, and so she expects to increase her sales thanks to this investment. In the future, she hopes to further expand her hardware store, so she will be able to support her three children with their education, as well as covering their daily needs and necessary payments. Jeaneth thanks the institution for its help in improving her life economically. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":474991,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing cement, iron, paints, wire and ceramics because her inventory of these products is low ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-22T14:40:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeaneth Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.29,"local_amount":1125.87,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1176.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874551},{"amount":56.07,"local_amount":1121.43,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1171.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604420},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":1086.03,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1134.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639888},{"amount":60.7,"local_amount":1214.07,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1268.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821670},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":1159.21,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1211.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561678},{"amount":56.13,"local_amount":1122.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770607},{"amount":56.16,"local_amount":1123.26,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204498},{"amount":54.91,"local_amount":1098.28,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:04:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330212},{"amount":47.47,"local_amount":949.18,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":991.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465389}],"funded_date":"2010-01-22T17:00:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:41:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":174718,"name":"Ibrahima","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Ibrahima F. est un yoffois de 41 ans qui habite plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans le quartier de Mbenguene.

She is 30 years old, married and has 4 school-age children. To make a living, Judy owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap,  toothpaste, canned goods & junk foods in the local community. Judy has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Judy joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Judy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Judy is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Judy from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the help of her past 25 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She currently rents her market stall, but if the business develops well after she receives the loan, she plans to buy her own space. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":230028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase Sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazokat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":340.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10230633},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20428638},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27122415},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36017777},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44601821},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52996393},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":170.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63217616},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73646934},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87086362},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-19T09:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97002134},{"amount":50,"local_amount":166.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-21T09:23:48Z","rounded_local_amount":170.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103847002}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T18:49:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-21T09:23:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":80115,"name":"Rolan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolan L., a 25-year-old, lives in Binarzang Quirino, Isabela with his parents.

M. is from the village of Capucao, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. She is 40 years old. Evelyn is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Evelyn raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting cassava for sale. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Evelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have seven children who are 9 to 25 years old. \r\n\r\nThelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loans from NWTF helped her earn a monthly profit of 11,500 Philippines pesos (PHP), uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to fund her various business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and for the expansion of her pig-fattening business. \r\n\r\nThelma B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. \r\n\r\nNelia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fresh fish to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Nelia from PMPC.

She lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her three businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,400.  Theresa is borrowing PHP 12,000 to fund her business operations.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Theresa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has almost never had anyone's assistance in helping her children get ahead, so for 21 years, she has been working sewing dresses in a tailor shop. This has been her only income to support and educate her children, and it has not been easy for her to have the entire responsibility for her family. But her love for her children is what drives her forward from day to day. <P>Bisolima\u2019s work is specialized: sewing European-style dresses for women as well as dresses in the national style. During her long years of activity, she has gained a rich experience in tailoring. <P>Bisolima herself purchases the fabrics required for sewing in the local market of \u201cKorvon\u201d. On average she sews four dresses and makes an income of 100-120 Somoni (about US$ 30-35) a day. <P>Bisolima always dreamed of owning a business and not having to depend on anyone else.
