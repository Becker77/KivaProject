He grew up in a large family and, from early childhood, he helped his parents in the field where his family cultivated vegetables. After serving in the army, Zaydullo returned home and began to work as a cinema operator.  He was 30 years old when he married, and he became the father of five children.  \r\nIn 1995, Zaydullo moved with his family to Kyrgyzstan. Using the money he had earned, he bought a house and started to work at the local state farm.  In order to find additional means of subsistence for his large family, Zaydullo decided to engage in cattle breeding and cultivating vegetables on the plot of land.  Using his starting capital of 3,000 KGS, he managed to raise his floating capital and earn 4,000 KGS monthly. Today, his farm has three bull-calves and still needs to be developed. For this purpose, Zaydullo plans to use this loan of 50,000 KGS to increase the number of cattle on his farm. Eventually,  Zaydullo plans to provide higher education for his children and build a house for his family. Being a very purposeful and positive person, Zaydullo works hard to support his family and provide them with a prosperous future.\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

","en":"Rafo has worked for more than eleven years making kurpachas (traditional velvet rugs) and mattresses, and embroidering pillow cases. She also helped her husband when he opened a beverage factory. After that, she opened her own workshop to sew mattresses, hiring her daughter and her sister.

Everyday income can be used for repayments. Before, she took out loan from a bank and had to pay in lump sum.

Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. \r\n<p>Neema is requesting $US350 to purchase additional stocks of sugar, wheat and maize flour, rice, and beans to enable her to serve more customers in the future and thus hopefully increase her profits from the cafe. \r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":191125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional foodstuffs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-02T20:24:44Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345765},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347917},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970491},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886708},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435968},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130270},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027101},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:42Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613141},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010224},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":40530,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232536}],"funded_date":"2008-08-19T20:24:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64723,"name":"Euk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Euk L., 28, is a rice farmer who resides with her children in Prey Veng, Cambodia.

For Betty, education is very important that\u2019s why the couple did everything they could to earn more income just to send their children to school. Like others, she has also had experience with the many challenges of poverty. She mentioned that she  would have to wake up early in the morning  to harvest rice just so that they have something to feed their children. \r\n \r\nBetty used her first P5, 000 loan to open up a variety store. She gave her best to establish it and hopes to make it a mini-grocery store someday. She plans to request her second loan amounting to P 10,000 that she will use for this grocery. The sacrifices that she has encountered are her weapon to survive, i.e., through ASHI after a year she will begin to have a mini-grocery.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to have a mini-grocery with refreshments situated at their home.   And if possible she can have a branch in the town proper of Tibiao in order to provide employment to others but she needs a working capital of Php 10,000 for her next loan.  Though this is her first time to join a micro-finance institution, she hope that these dreams will come true and that ASHI will in fact give the best direction and opportunity to all members.

Since Don Crescencio had success in the trial, they were encouraged to grow and continued acquiring more clients who asked them for other things such as empanadas and then vegetables, and so they grew the business little by little.

She works with her husband in the same place - cafe Etis. He works as an electrician and she is a cook. They have raised one son who is twenty one right now. At this time he is studying in university. Using his free time he works as a miscellaneous worker in a private construction company in the city of Bishkek. In today's time one profession or job is not enough and Raisa also decided to walk in foot with time. She has managed to find a good use for her cooking skills. And in a way so that it benefits her financially. She has partnered with some stores and cafes so that she will supply them with her own made \"pelmeni\" (dumplings with filling). Besides that she was also able to find clients to purchase noodles for lagman (a dish consisting of long noodles, meat and vegetables), which Raisa will also make herself. For Raisa this extra business has turned out to be a really good thing. Because she does not need to go anywhere. She completes all her orders from home and this is why this job does not wear her out. Besides that Raisa had a few debts. The salary of a cook in cafe alone was not enough to pay off her debts all at once. But after she has started her own business it did not take very much for her to pay off all of her debts. Only a few hours of work during the weekends brings Raisa around 3,000 soms monthly. Many people have to work a whole month for this money. Right now Raisa decided to ask for a loan to buy two bags of flour, meat for the filling and use the remainder of the loan to pay her son's tuition. \r\n\r\nRaisa has four partners in her group:\r\n\r\nNasykat is twenty years old. She works as a bartender in a cafe. Nasykat is not married and lives with parents. She needs a loan to pay her tuition contract.\r\n\r\nZhyldyz is 25 years old. Zhyldyz is not married and works as a waitress in a cafe. At home she and her brother feed and sell cattle. Zhyldyz needs a loan to buy two calves.\r\n\r\nOlga is 52 years old. Olga works as a dishwasher in a cafe and has also recently opened a small grocery store. Olga wants to get a loan and buy two tons of coal and merchandise for the store.\r\n \r\nTurat is 21 years old. He is studying in a polytechnic university and also works as an operator at a gas station. Turat hopes to get a loan to pay his tuition fees.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":441053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy flour and meat for dumplings and noodles, and to pay for son's education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kant","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-12-05T23:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nasykat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Turat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":55000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10101},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10419},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10978},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":11493},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":12009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":234.16,"local_amount":10101,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10267.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730800},{"amount":241.53,"local_amount":10419,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":10591.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118121347},{"amount":254.49,"local_amount":10978,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":11159.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123956999},{"amount":266.43,"local_amount":11493,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-21T07:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11682.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128989808},{"amount":278.39,"local_amount":12009,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":12207.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715617}],"funded_date":"2009-12-07T20:46:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":163314,"name":"K\u00b4alamarka Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco de Emprendimiento KALAMARKA trabaja con nuestra Instituci\u00f3n hace mas de dos a\u00f1os, este banco se caracteriza porque sus integrantes son 50% varones y 50% mujeres, las socias se dedican al comercio y venta de frutas, los socios la mayoria son transportistas.La se\u00f1ora Dur\u00e1n es una participante antigua y ocupa el cargo de presidenta con el prestamo a logrado diversificar y aumentar la producci\u00f3n de frutas que tiene en la localidad de Sapaqui, con este negocio a podido aumentar su capital y brindarles mejores condiciones de vida a su n\u00famerosa familia. la se\u00f1ora VICENTA, Es una nueva integrante y tiene a su cargo la secretaria, ella se dedica a la venta de CDs en las cuidades de La Paz y El Alto, con el prestamo a logrado traer por cantidad CDs,VCDs, mejorando de esta forma sus ingresos.

The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month.  Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC.  The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled.  Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities.  The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Mme Coumba Seck.  They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC.  According to the president, the group has one praiseworthy objective -- to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nSubgroup 3's president is Mme Kanane Rose N., 47 years old with three children.

Trece, Brgy. Tiniguiban, Puerto Princesa, Palawan. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: she runs a restaurant, rents out commercial space and is an authorized purified water distributor. She has three adult children. Cornelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cornelia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her raise her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to expand and improve her restaurant so that she can continue to save up in order to buy a motorcycle for business use. Cornelia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Maricalum, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  vegetable vending and farming. Her husband, Fausto Tabo-tabo, who is 58 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are between 23 and 36 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorentina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She is 45 years old. Nilda is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Millions.\r\n\r\nNilda is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Nilda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general clothing services to local community members. Nilda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nilda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nilda is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Nilda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

America is very grateful for the confidence that is being shown in her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":800406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

She started her business in animal husbandry 20 years ago with an initial sum of 3,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her persistent work, Jukunay's business yields about 5,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products.  She also works on 3.12 hectares of land, where she grows potatoes and barley.  In the summer, Jukunay and her family travel to the pastures (\"jailoo\") of the mountain lake Son-Kol, where they set up a \"yurt\" - national felt house - where tourists and visiting guests can stop.  In order to further develop her animal husbandry business, Jukunay requested a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase three bulls and ten sheep.  She plans to invest the profits into further increasing livestock

Through her business venture she has been able to provide an education for her older son. Now she would like to provide a good education for her younger son.

To meet this demand, she needs to exchange her winter inventory for a spring one.

He is thirty-two years old, married and a father with two kids. Fortunately, both his kids are in school through the help of government free basic compulsory education. <P>\r\n\r\nAmoako lives at Atebubu with his immediate family where he was born and bred. He is a teacher and also sells bags of charcoal. He has been in this business for five years now, earning income to care of his household. <P>\r\n\r\nCharcoal is a very popular source of energy for cooking in many traditional Ghanaian homes. He obtains his supply of charcoal from Awaso which is two towns over from Atebubu where he lives, and he retails it to his customers who come from Kumasi to buy. <P>\r\n\r\nAmoako is a very clever person. He was a student at the University of Development Studies (UDS) in the Northern part of Ghana. He deferred when he was in second year because of financial constraints, thinking that he could get a job that could fetch him high sums of money to pay his fees and other expenses. Unfortunately he could not make it and finally dropped out of school. <P>\r\n\r\nAmoako says he has been affected psychologically.

This is 28 year old Rose M. from Mbeya. She is single with no  children, but she is responsible for supporting two dependants because they are orphans. \n\nRose has been running a vitenge and clothing sale business since 2008. She sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\n\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Rose currently earns about 90USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 250 USD in order to purchase more vitenge in bulk. In the future, she plans to open a new business. Rose thanks you for your support!\n\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Kamardin is 35 years old, is married, and has four children. The last five years of his life he has devoted to agricultural work and on market days he brings his products to the market.\r\n\r\nFor Kamardin the harvest is what he enjoys the most and he devotes a lot of time to sorting the melons and watermelons that he will sell because the price will depend on their size. Agriculture is full of satisfaction for him and his family - even more when the produce sells for a good price at the market. That is his motivation to continue planting.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan that Kamardin has with IMON International, having made his payments on time for his first loan. With the money requested he will buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his farm.\r\n\r\nKamardin is very grateful to those who support him because they allow him to provide well-being to his family.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Occ. She earns her living by operating five business ventures: sari-sari (general) store, buying and selling of vegetables, fishing, farming, and transport. Her husband Arturo P., who is 41 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 1 child who is 9 years old.\r\n\r\nShirley joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Shirley has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to use as funds for business operations so that she can continue to save up for future education expenses for her child. Shirley P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Bugnay, Brgy. Vsta Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by buying and selling nipa, a type of palm leaf which is used in homes and to make items such as baskets. Her husband Josue B., who is 52 years old, works as caretaker of a fish pond and also helps in his wife in her business activities. They have two children who are 18 and 21 years old. The older one is married while the younger is still in school. Merlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she wanted a better for her family. With the help of her 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She has applied for a new loan to buy more nipa to sell, and hopes to generate enough income to help her younger child complete school. Merlinda B. following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells regional produce such as tomatoes, cucumbers and many other types of vegetables from a small stand in the Bellavista market.  She gets up very early, 2am, in order to go shopping at the port and take advantage of the variety of produce brought in from the countryside.  After purchasing the vegetables, she brings them to the market to sell at 7am.   She counts on a good quantity of customers who consume a lot of the regional produce.   What she likes about her work is the selling and the good customer service.   Nuria works to help with the household costs and the education of her children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Married to Juan Apolonio B., they are blessed with nine children. Of the nine, three are already working, and six stay at home. Her husband works as a head of exploration in a mining company and they live in Caloocan City. In spite of the great size of her family, Mary Ann is a determined businesswoman. Her barbecue stand has been helping her family for three years as an added source of income. She became a member of the Center for Community Transformation* just this year, and has already received three loans from CCT because of good attendance in their weekly fellowship meetings and her regular payment of dues.\r\n\r\nShe wants to further expand her business this Christmas season by applying for a PHP 8,000 loan so that she can use it as additional capital to buy more meat for her barbecue stand.

She lives with her husband and two children who are students. For nineteen years Gloria has made and sold tortillas. Her business is very profitable because, as she says, there is no competition in the area. She runs the business out of her home, where her customers come to buy the tortillas on a daily basis. Tortillas are eaten everyday, and up to twice daily with meals. \r\n\r\nGloria is asking for a loan to buy corn wholesale and take advantage of cheaper prices by buying at this time of year. It is very important to her to be able to sell more tortillas as her children are growing and will need extra things. As well, the cost of their education will get more expensive.

She is 43 years old. Josephine is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP whenever she sells her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Miriam, as she herself was a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave their children.\r\n\r\nMiriam operates a variety store while overseeing operations of their tricycle. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Miriam earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and reselling at a piece rate. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her tricycle, a sidecar attached to a motorcycle which is used as transportation between narrow streets and off the highways, is being operated by her husband. Miriam\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers in her store and for her tricycle are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more products such as groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMiriam dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through her hard work in her business. She also hopes to save part of her income to use for future expansion of her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":565159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-07-07T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":583.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94.79,"local_amount":4083.31,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4411.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608177},{"amount":67.71,"local_amount":2916.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3150.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821688},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2333.32,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2520.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088932},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":2333.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2520.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380301},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2333.4,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2520.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816656}],"funded_date":"2010-07-12T09:59:19Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":217201,"name":"Duyen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Duyen T.

dada su cercania con la sierra norte del pa\u00eds.\n\nSe dedica desde hace mas de treinta a\u00f1os a la agricultura, ella cuenta con un terreno de cultivo en donde suele sembrar arroz, cabe resaltar que la zona posee abundante agua en sus canales de regad\u00edo por lo que este cultivo se siembra dos veces al a\u00f1o, a diferencia de la mayor parte de los distritos de la regi\u00f3n que solo lo siembran una vez al a\u00f1o.\n\nEsta actividad es una fuente bastante importante de ingresos para su familia por lo que siempre trabaja arduamente de modo que pueda conseguir una buena cosecha,

fertilizantes y pesticidas.\n\nSu mas grande anhelo es seguir trabajando para poder brindarle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida, Rosa es una persona tranquila, responsable y muy trabajadora, en

district located 2 hours away from the city of Chiclayo. The area is known for its fertile land, and to the rugged terrain it owes to its proximity to the mountains in the north of the country.\r\n\r\nRosa has spent more than 30 years working in agriculture. She has a plot of land on which she grows rice, and which has so much water for its irrigation channels that she is able to plant twice a year. Most rice-growing districts in the region are able to plant just one crop per year.\r\n\r\nRice-growing is very important to the family's income, so she always works hard to ensure a good harvest. To achieve her aim of a good harvest, Rosa has decided to seek a loan for the first time, of 2000 soles ($725) from Edpyme Alternativa. She plans to invest it in the purchase of fertilizers and pesticides. Her greatest wish is to go on working to be able to improve her family's quality of life. Rosa is a calm, responsible and very hard-working woman, and her neighbours regard her as a reliable, trustworthy person.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":581370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and pesticides that will improve the rice crop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oyot\u00fan - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T06:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108214}],"funded_date":"2010-08-14T17:28:13Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":225393,"name":"Marco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl socio pertenece al banco comunal  \u201cPATRON DE SANTIAGO DE SANTIAGO\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Santiago, perteneciente a la provincia y departamento del Cusco.\n\nEl socio es el Sr .Marco;  El tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad,  es soltero y  se dedica a la compra y venta de celulares, el alquila un espacio en el mercado el para\u00edso y hay vende celulares de segunda mano, tambi\u00e9n repuestos y accesorios y algunas veces los repara.

Gumamela, Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business of buying and selling nipa (palm branches) and gasoline. Her husband, Riolly, who is 33 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 7 years old.\r\n\r\nConsuelo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Consuelo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use for the repair and maintenance of her motorcycle, so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her child. Consuelo C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She travels with her products in the surrounding areas of Montecristi.  Mar\u00eda works four days a week from 5am to 12pm.  On the days that she sells, Mar\u00eda leaves the house very early in the morning and goes to Manta in order to bring back the best fish for her customers.  She says that she always likes bringing back only what she needs to sell and then attempts to sell it all because keeping any leftover fish for another day has a high cost since her customers do not like frozen fish.  Mar\u00eda has been in business for more than eight years.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to buy fish for her daily business.  She has participated in 15 loan cycles with the Communal Bank and likes the meetings because they allow her to share nice moments with her friends.

Mariana has a great deal of experience in farming and her workshop.  The location of her business is quite good for selling items.  She has many customers already that rely on her for certain items.  Also, since she now has enough capital, she can ensure that her products are always available.  Many people run out of goods during the day since they cannot afford to purchase any more in the morning due to a lack of capital.  This loan will increase her customer's confidence in her shop. \r\n\r\n<p>Mariana will use the profits from this loan to purchase a plot of land for herself.  She also hopes to help her son open a shop.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount to a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Once they saw that sales were good, they decided to buy soft drinks, crackers, and some candy for children that go past the garden (an early childhood educational facility) in front of their house .

Lucila is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Lucila from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He is married to his wife Julia, who is 56 years old.  Together, they have 7 children, of whom only three live with them at home in their own house, built of quality materials.  The care that they take with their crops always repays them with good harvests.  That\u2019s why they give their crops all the time they need.  In this way, they\u2019ve managed to work for thirty years without a break.  What he enjoys most is harvesting his crops, because for him it is very gratifying to see the quality of his products.  However, what bother him the most is to have to work alone without counting on the help of his family, and that\u2019s why he has to hire laborers.  Along with his job farming, he builds houses while his wife works selling food in their community. Now, however, she is in the capital visiting their adult children.

She started this business two years ago by selling school supplies to children when the school term started, taking advantage of the fact that her house is a half a block from the school.  She is well situated for the children to buy at her bookstore.  Her mother passed this business on to her, in the beginning her mother was the one going to Managua to do the purchasing.  By increasing her merchandise, she expects her sales to increase and therefore her income.  This is due to her offering good products at accessible prices.

Es as\u00ed que todos los d\u00edas, desde muy temprano trabaja confeccionando mandiles o delantales de uso para  la cocina o diversos trabajos del hogar.

A la semana produce de 200 a 300 mandiles y los distribuye al mercado m\u00e1s grande de su distrito, donde tiene muchos clientes que reconocen su trabajo. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de la confecci\u00f3n de mandiles; es que no es muy trabajoso, ni requiere realizar muchos trazos, pero si es muy rentable. Es por ello que en adelante piensa asegurar las puertas y ventanas de su casa; con rejas, para asegurar sus  maquinas de coser. Este es su onceavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y se compromete en pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente, considerando \u00e9ste cr\u00e9dito muy \u00fatil en el progreso de su negocio.

He lives in his parents' home and he most desires to improve his quality of life.  Thus, work is important and where possible he supports his mother and sisters. So, every day, he starts working very early in the morning making leather aprons or pinafores for kitchen use or various household uses. He learned this work from his father when he was a child, and since then his home has become his studio and his workplace. In one week he produces 200 to 300 aprons and sells them in the largest marked in the district, where he has many customers who recognize his work. He most enjoys making the aprons; since it is not very arduous work, nor does it require much designing, but it is very profitable. Thus, in the future he wants to secure the doors and windows of his house; with bars, to secure his sewing machines. This is his eleventh loan with MFP, and he promises to pay all of the quotas punctually, since this loan will be very useful in the progress of his business.  With this loan, he will invest in the purchase of another sewing machine, in order to work with thinner materials. He hopes that his sister will be able to specialize in this activity.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":605533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase another sewing machine, to make thinner stitches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":156.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":170.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":176.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":185.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.38,"local_amount":270.34,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:17Z","rounded_local_amount":283.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449968},{"amount":137.83,"local_amount":367.56,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":385.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588667},{"amount":66.37,"local_amount":176.97,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":185.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463262},{"amount":69.42,"local_amount":185.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":194.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327852}],"funded_date":"2010-10-02T16:08:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":237701,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita C. is from the village of Diamantina, Cabatuan, Isabela.

C. is a 35-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: a general store and a fish vending business. She lives in Purok 5, Culipapa, Hinobaan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002, and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF, and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\nBy working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. Elisa is now borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Elisa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day, to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

To make a living, Victoria owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Victoria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victoria is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Victoria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

and operating a general store.  She lives in the municipality of Narra, Palawan. Jonife joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jonife has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 to buy more stock of fruits and vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Jonife is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He buys used starter motors to fix and renovate.  After such alterations, he sells starter motors at a higher price.

Let's make his dream come true.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She says she bakes at most 1000 loaves of bread in a day. <P>\r\n\r\nYaa needs the loan to buy more bags of flour, sugar, margarine, milk, and firewood, etc. to restock her inventory.

Mirhalim is 51 years old. He has experience of 2 years preparing and selling cookies and different kinds of sweets. He began working with a friend delivering bread.

The business is successful, generating stable, considerable income, allowing Mirhalim to support his family. Mirhalim wants the Kiva loan to be able to buy products and necessary equipment for the preparation of the extra cookies, because at this time he is only supplying the part of the demand.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a far cry from, and in contrast to, when she was a housewife when odds seemed to be stacked against her. With a stable business running, she also rationalized that eking out side-profits constructing and running a rental and retail shop business where she sells blankets and mattresses, would not be a bad proposition.\r\n\r\nP. has managed to reconcile all her duties well and her businesses are all driving a roaring trade.

I. is from the village of Centro 2.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for more than seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide her service. Marites is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

","en":"Doris is 43 years old and lives in her own home with her husband Pedro, age 45, who works as a mason.  Her grown son works and helps with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nEight years ago, Doris and her husband started a furniture manufacturing business.  Since then, she spends most of her time sewing.  On the weekends when her husband is resting, they both will spend some time assembling furniture.  Doris is very satisfied because their business has not experienced any losses since their work is done according to order.  This business has enabled her to do a better job of covering the household expenses.  However, Doris dislikes those instances when her customers delay the delivery of completed furniture because the pieces collect dirt since she lives in a dusty area.  She says that she has several established customers who buy merchandise from her regularly because they know that her furniture will be comfortable and of good quality.  In addition, Doris is an enterprising woman who has future plans to expand her business and produce a higher quantity of furniture.  The money she requested will be invested in the purchase of materials (fabric and wood) that she is lacking so that she can complete an outstanding order and hopefully increase her earnings.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Doris promises to complete her payments on time because she does not want to look bad in the eyes of those responsible for making this loan possible so that she could continue working and moving forward."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":715088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabric & wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":121.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":124.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":146.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.06},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.38,"local_amount":121.02,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":125.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327739},{"amount":95.93,"local_amount":255.8,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":265.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269943},{"amount":32.13,"local_amount":85.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":88.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718637},{"amount":71.76,"local_amount":191.35,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":198.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851430},{"amount":54.8,"local_amount":146.15,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":151.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666717}],"funded_date":"2011-02-21T12:55:09Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":278698,"name":"Sinat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sinat T. is 30 years old and her husband, Mr. Chantha Chhin is 39 years old.

He is a private entrepreneur who sells car spare parts. Sunnatullo is very disciplined. One of his strong characteristics is his ability to listen and persuade, which helps him in his work with customers. Sunnatullo has been in the market for 12 years. His main goal is to provide his family with a decent life and stable future. He has always tried to achieve financial and economic independence and make a career. Sunnatullo is hoping to see his business flourish and succeed. Sunnatullo believes this loan of 8,000 TJS will allow him to purchase spare car parts for his business and will be one of the steps towards his goal. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fee. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
