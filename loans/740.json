It is important to note that since he started his business, he has acquired an abundance of experience due to his great dedication and the knowledge he has acquired, breeding his animals. The reason why Karimjon looks for support to IMON International is that he needs to purchase livestock so he may sell it and in that way, continue with his arduous work with cattle in his sector.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

tale of a certain 45-year-old man who has gained quite a reputation for being a stickler for hard work in his charcoal-selling business. For a decade, M. David, a happily married, sturdy and affable gentleman, has blazed an enterprising trail not only for himself, but also for his fellow upstart business colleagues.\r\n\r\nDavid has been testimony to the fact that, with a strong sense of determination, one\u2019s plans cannot be thrown out of gear. His business has also benefitted a lot from his strong pro-activeness and robust customer relationship skills. As a result, he has established for himself a firm niche in the local market.\r\n\r\nDavid\u2019s dream is to open up other outlets in surrounding villages and parishes so as to solidify his financial base. Given his large-scale distribution transactions over these years of operating, he anticipates this will come to pass.\r\n\r\nIn a week, as a result of his diligence, David makes profits totaling up to 60,000 shillings and he is upbeat that, with this loan, his financial prospects for the future are bright. He wants to buy more bags of charcoal.\r\n\r\nWith this business, all David\u2019s five children have basked in the glow of a good education and the family\u2019s welfare has also improved a great deal.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":554026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more bags of charcoal to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kayunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 32.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-15T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Didas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amuza","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakubu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550000},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":550000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689347},{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903496},{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296969},{"amount":250,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":560625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467264}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T19:51:06Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":211693,"name":"Celina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Celina S. is currently in the business of knitting and selling table and chair sets and is requesting a loan to stock more knitting needles and thread.

He runs a shop in the market, earning income by selling different colored and designed tiles to customers. Nowadays, tiles are in high demand as people like to cover their floors with tiles rather than with marble, etc.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to improve her clothes selling business, which she started fifteen years ago. She purchases clothes from Lahore\u2019s wholesale market, Ichra and Shahalmi, and sells them to her local area clients on profit.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has two children, ages 4 and 8. The elder child goes to school. Joao studies electronic engineering at Eduardo Mondlane University. He lives with his family in military housing, and sometimes he sends his parents some money for household expenses.\r\n\r\nTo continue his studies, he left Inhambane to move to Maputo, where he later began obligatory military service in 1983. Joao worked for the Ministry of Defense and is still working there, where he receives a monthly salary of 16,680 meticais per month. After paying his household expenses, he deposits the rest in his bank account (at BIM).\r\n\r\nHe has already had loans from Millennium BIM Bank, and he paid them off without problems. Joao learned about Hluvuku through friends and coworkers who are also customers of this institution.

He has been rice farming in the sector his entire life. He is also one of the main leaders of the rural associations there. He is hoping he can receive the loan in order to invest in his lands and buy feed for his livestock. F. is proud to receive these loans and be part of a communal bank he helped form. He is pictured with a tractor he rented to work his lands. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the members of the Buena Suerte de Salitre Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Buena Suerte Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the

This work is satisfying, and it enables David to purchase goods for his home. However the most trying feature of this work is dealing with the changes in climate, which can damage the crops. Because of this, farmers like David must buy products that help protect the crops from shifts in the weather. David is motivated by his desire to offer his family a better quality of life. This time, he would like to invest in the purchase of supplies to protect his crops, so as to have a better harvest and sell his crops outside of his hometown.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDavid tiene 23 a\u00f1os, vive en la casa de su madre, junto a su esposa y su peque\u00f1a hija de 1 a\u00f1o.\r\nEs agricultor, desde que se cas\u00f3 demostr\u00f3 que a pesar de ser joven puede solventar a su familia a base de esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n, por ello, siempre est\u00e1 en sus terrenos de cultivos sembrando papa, en lo que ocupa gran parte del d\u00eda, desde la madrugada sale a regar sus terrenos para luego dedicarse al abono o a la fumigaci\u00f3n.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a small piece of land that was given to him and his brothers by his father. He primarily produces rice on his part of the land. He lives with his wife and children on his land, with his brothers nearby. They are a very close knit family who help each other out by working cohesively on their lands. He hopes that with the loan he can make his land more productive for rice, as now it is not level and he needs to rent machinery to level it out. With the extra profits he wants to improve his home which is in poor condition. \r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p> Baldomero is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that it is imperative for the communities it works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui, who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize, or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water from the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds, and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-16T17:39:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baldomero","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-03T02:27:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:25:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21964},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:24:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29291},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:11:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40398},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:21:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65660},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66076}],"funded_date":"2007-05-20T02:27:14Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:50:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14215,"name":"Miriam Deyanira","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Deyanira is a very hard-working and cheerful woman.

This is 25-year-old Hadija M. from Tukuyu. She is married with two children aged four and seven.

Hadija thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

L\u00f3pez is 26 years old and is a single mother.  She sells general merchandise and has been doing so for more than 11 years.  Previously, she sold spices to provide daily food to her family, who survived on this business.  However, Arelis had trouble caring for her mother because of her mother\u2019s health problems.  This caused Arelis to be very tired because sometimes she didn\u2019t sleep because she was keeping an eye on her mother.  Then, the next morning, she would have to get up early to attend to the business.  As a result, Arelis decided to begin selling bananas and decided to continue with this job after seeing the income.  It is because of this that Arelis is asking for a loan for working capital to buy more bananas.

Jos\u00e9 started out in farming by helping his dad, Rodolfo Valvidia, when he was very young.  His dad used to grow cabbages and onions.  Jos\u00e9 learned a lot in spite of the fact that he also had to study.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 started working independently at the age of 18, sowing just over 3 acres of cabbages together with a partner.  Back then he made some losses in his harvests but he at least managed to recoup what he had invested.  He didn't give up, however, but planted cabbages again.  This time he managed to make $1,000 US profit though, of course, he had to split the money between himself and his business partner.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 then decided to work with one of his brothers and they rented a plot of land from their grandmother so that they could work with the family.  Jos\u00e9 also raises livestock which he has been buying with the profits that he has made from his cabbage and tomato crops.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has requested this loan to maintain nearly 3 acres of tomato crops.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She's married and a mother of two boys, ages 5 and 3. She lives on Tacna Avenue in the town of Mazocruz. In 2002, she decided to join the Generation 2000 Community Bank, and with her initial loan she purchased outfits for infants, jackets, and wool pants. Teresa was orphaned at age 12, and the next year she started selling gelatins. When she turned 21, she started a family and began selling clothes, making sweaters and cloths for TVs.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

family in the village of Kokzhar in the south of Kyrgystan. 15 years ago he launched his cattle raising business with a starting capital of 10,000 KGS. Tireless work and dedication   allowed him to grow his business, which now brings him a monthly income of 20,000 KGS.

However, luck was on her side, and in the year 2005, Anne teamed up with her cousin Fridah Wanjiku and together, they rented a stall and they agreed to share the rent.  Anne deals in the sale of shoes and an assortment of other items, while her cousin deals in the sale of clothes, hence their businesses are complementary.  During the holiday seasons like the upcoming month of December, the demand of clothes and shoes are always high because this is when many people buy things as gifts for their families, both in urban and rural places.\r\n\r\nAnne\u2019s business has been growing due to the high population in her area, and she finds that she always runs out of stock due to the high demand of the items in her stall.  She now needs to purchase stock of men\u2019s shoes, ladies\u2019 shoes, children\u2019s shoes, plastic items, cutlery, and also bedcovers. Wamaitha is therefore requesting a loan of USD 775, with which to increase her inventory.  With an increase in her stock, she will be able to increase her profit, hence resulting in more income.  She also intends to employ an additional person to help her around the boutique. The repayment period for her loan will be 10 months."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":78505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stock of assorted shoes, assorted plastic items, cutlery and bedcovers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":26536,"name":"Mshikamano Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"(Left to Right) Sulemani C., Hassani B.

We are four women who all live in the city of Tegucigalpa.  I'm Johanna B., I'm 23 years old and I'm the coordinator of the group.   Glenda Xiomara is 34 years old, Zonia C. is 29 and Nancy M. is 27 years old.   We are all young and work making and selling tortillas.  Glenda sells clothing as well.  Very early in the morning, we make the first batch of tortillas which we pack and sell.  In the middle of the day, we make another batch to sell from 4 in the afternoon onwards.   The demand for the tortillas has grown a lot and we can hardly cope with all of the requests.  We need the loan so that we can make greater quantities and increase our sales and our income.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":255842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional hair products for her salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T05:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elinaike","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436383},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130655},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027452},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613453},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010533},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232829}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T11:00:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":87999,"name":"Cecilia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cecilia del Carmen M. tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es acompa\u00f1ada y junto a sus tres hijos menores de edad reside en el municipio de Apopa, departamento de San salvador.

All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nThese women intend to use this loan to buy 180 kg of onions, 200 kg of salt, 10 boxes (2 kg each) of tomato paste, and a large quantity of various condiments.  Supplies are gotten at the Fana marketplace in order to be sold retail at the local ZAFINA marketplace, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed essentially of women.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, the group members hope to make a profit of 25,000 francs CFA that they will use to buy some small ruminants.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":279330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mama Issouf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnagale  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussokoura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":116666.66,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":118950.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033686},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621054},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020019},{"amount":116.68,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242764},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678321}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T15:09:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":96191,"name":"Las Poderosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal \"Las PodeR.\" esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Carmen Cecilia y conformada por 12 miembros los cuales se dedican a actividades de venta de productos como dulces, tarjetas, cosm\u00e9ticos, electrodom\u00e9sticos y al servicio de mensajeria, secretaria y soldadura de arco y oxigeno.

Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, the Mongolian nomadic tent. Her husband operates a taxi service in their town. Currently, Tsetsgee operates a Mongolian fast food restaurant and second-hand shoe-trading business. She has been operating her restaurant since 2007, and has built a stable operation. She also opened a used clothing business in 2008. Over the years, she has been expanding her businesses. Her shoe repair business is seasonal, and does not operate during the winter.

She plans to start with sodas, then move on to water, carbonated water and lemon-flavored water. Ada will use her 1000 PEN (USD 325) to buy water tanks and installation tubes. \r\n\r\nAda became an Arariwa client when she was 18 and worked with the institution for three years. She returned about two years ago because she likes its mandatory savings program (in which clients are obliged to save 5% of their loan amount in a collective savings account). She has pledged to repay her Kiva loan in full and on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy water tanks and installation tubing for a new business manufacturing drinks and carbonated water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Calca - Calca - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":235.49},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":244.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":254.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":264.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.53},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.53,"local_amount":235.49,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":237.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409856},{"amount":79.76,"local_amount":245.4,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":247.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918314},{"amount":82.86,"local_amount":254.96,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":257.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139153},{"amount":85.85,"local_amount":264.15,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":266.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564772}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T15:07:06Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":108495,"name":"Abduaziz","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0437 \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 1962 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0412\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442. \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 18 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u0423\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b  \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438  \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043a \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0442\u0440\u0438- \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0430   \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u043a.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
