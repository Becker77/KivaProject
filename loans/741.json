It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with Claudia, 37 years old, and they have 3 children from their relationship. They live together in a house that is their own and where happiness reigns. Julio is a man who works every day for the welfare of his children. His work consists of working the land. He is a farmer and he has 6 hectares of land where he cultivates cocoa and coffee. These are native plants to the jungle region of Valle Rio Apurimac. Seventeen years have passed and today he continues with the business to forge a future for his children. In turn, they help him during the harvest and he also hires farm hands especially because this work requires a great deal of effort and expediency to harvest the entire product to sell to the distributing companies. They pay him very well for each kilogram of product that he sells. He considers the most difficult part is having to transport his products from the fields to the city of San Francisco. That is where they give him better prices for his products. For the moment the priority is to purchase more cocoa seeds as he has enough room to plant them.

Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento y con el comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen, insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus alimentos, pues su mayor desaf\u00edo es no tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para comprar de contado y en un importante volumen, que le permita sostener unos buenos inventarios y disminuir los costos del transporte.\n","en":"Aid\u00e9e, 40, is a very hard working woman living in the town of Soledad with her spouse.  She has five children ranging in ages from 5 to 27 years.  For the last 18 years, since she received the house she currently lives in from the national government because she was the victim of erosion, she decided to sell coffee and sugar taking advantage of the fact that her mother was known for working in the market.  A grainer financed her initial purchases.  When Aid\u00e9e\u2019s mother disappeared her banana selling business passed down to her and this is where she gained most of her experience.\r\n\r\nLater on, noticing business opportunities in the neighborhood where she still lives and striving to be able to pay closer attention to her family obligations, she decided to set up a food selling business because it was difficult for her neighbors because there was no gas and they had to work so it occurred to her to offer prepared meals cooked over firewood.  Her clientele dates from back then and she has gradually gained position in the market until this day when she has better infrastructure and a good clientele composed of housewives, employees, independent workers who consume the fried fast food and lunches she prepares daily; most pay cash though she does have a few credit customers.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to do more adjustments to her locale installing a comfortable terrace that\u2019s protected from the sun and the rain so that her customers can find a place of rest and pleasant refuge in her place of business.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is her first.  She will buy ingredients in larger amounts to prepare her meals because her greatest challenge is not having sufficient working capital to pay cash and in significant volume that will allow her to keep good stock inventory on hand and to diminish transportation costs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":808830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" to buy meal preparation ingredients in larger amounts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-12T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aidee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":43602},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46673},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":47568},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":48480},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":49409},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50356},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":51321},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":52305},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":53307},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56979}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.16,"local_amount":43602,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":46174.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320476},{"amount":28.01,"local_amount":46673,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":49426.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803592},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":47568,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50374.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614675},{"amount":29.08,"local_amount":48480,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:17Z","rounded_local_amount":51340.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568627},{"amount":29.65,"local_amount":49409,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52324.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779966},{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":50356,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:39Z","rounded_local_amount":53327,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188359},{"amount":30.8,"local_amount":51321,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:39Z","rounded_local_amount":54348.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324586},{"amount":29.57,"local_amount":49281,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52188.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140427},{"amount":67.98,"local_amount":113310,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":119995.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338953}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T17:21:11Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:37:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":319114,"name":"66 Thieu Do Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Them works in agriculture, farming\u00a0food.

By using a very efficient method of tying a horse onto a pole that is connected to a bucket of ingredients to mix, it saves a lot of time and labor for the brothers. Afterwards, the brothers take the mixture and place it into a mold that can make four stones each time. Then they lay the molded wet clay onto the ground for it to dry, which usually takes two days. The final process after it is dried is to fire it in a large kiln. Each day they make about 3000 stones. \r\n<p>\r\nFrancisco and he\u00b4s brother are a hard workers; they work from 7 am until 5 pm everyday. Francisco and his brother have a stable group of clients in Carapegua that depend on them to supply the stones that are use in constructing houses. They are in need of a loan to purchase lumber for the kiln in order to fire the stones."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":51340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase lumber.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Carapegua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.8 -57.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2007-07-28T03:25:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-11T04:12:47Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-08-30T09:25:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-30T21:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":48386},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-01T00:53:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-30T21:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":60995},{"amount":32,"local_amount":32,"processed_date":"2007-10-30T10:28:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-30T21:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":74217}],"funded_date":"2007-07-28T04:12:47Z","paid_date":"2007-10-30T10:28:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19171,"name":"Yashar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yashar is 40 years old and a resident of Aghsu region, located in the central part of Azerbaijan.

The members plan to use the loan for various purposes. Mr. Thy S. is the village bank president, selected by the members. He is 29 years old and the father of two children who are enrolled in the local school. He is a farmer who owns a piece of land where he cultivates both rice and vegetables to earn his living. His wife, Mrs. Kong Chrean, is a pig breeder. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand it; thus, they decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets for breeding. They hope to increase their income and improve their living conditions with this loan. \r\n\r\nAll the members in this village bank loan have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

Mahkamboy is dedicated to agriculture and the sale of cultivated vegetables, which means that he can be around his family, helping to raise their quality of life and educate his three children. Mahkamboy has been characterized as a person who is hard working, since he has been working in agriculture since he was very young. This kind of work requires effort, dedication and above all, strength, as it can include heavy work, meaning that people get tired quickly.

For this reason, he is asking for help in order to be able to receive more credit from IMON International.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She expects to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 120'000 (ca US$ 240), to be used to repay the loan and to help with the family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":281741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy peanuts, yams, and various other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sanankoroba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52079.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033702},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52079.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621070},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52079.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020035},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52079.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242780},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52079.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678355},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52079.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112447}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T19:39:46Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":97019,"name":"Bummi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bummi sells crates of drinks in retail to her customers.

Her eldest child is a grade five student and her youngest child is five years old.\r\n\r\nRosemarie knew that she had to be hardworking to achieve her dreams of sending all her five children to school until college and to build a stable house someday. She knew that she had to have a business of her own since she has no one to depend on to sustain the needs of her children and to give them a better kind of living - eating regular meals with enough food and better clothing. Her husband, Alexis, understood where his wife's feelings were coming from because he is in prison.\r\n\r\nRosemarie, came from a very poor family. She wanted to have her own business if her children were not to experience the bitter experiences that poverty had given her. When ASHI came one day and knocked on her door, she embraced the opportunity of loaning to achieve her vision of having her own business.\r\n\r\nNow, her loanable amount is bigger and she has more options to enhance her business of buying and selling first-aid medicines. For the loan she has applied for now, she will not only be changing her own family life but also the lives of poor families in their village. Her business gives people access to first-aid medicines and provides services such as checking their blood-pressure.\r\n\r\nWith all of the adversities caused by poverty, Rosemarie's hope is with the loans she can obtain from ASHI.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":351855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural

Bank is located in the city of Cuenca.  This city is known for its writers and artists as well as for it beautiful architecture.  It also has beautiful scenery and an uneven terrain.  Its cold climate contrasts with the warmth of the kind and cordial people like our members.\r\n\r\nFlor V. lives in the outskirts of the city of Cuenca.  She is an active member of the Alianza Unida Communal Bank.  She is 41, married, and has three children.  They are 23, 21, and 15.  Her oldest son works and helps with the electricity payments.  The second child attends the Catholic University of Cuenca.  Her last child goes to the Instituto IEISA.  They maintain a good family relationship with each other.  They have their own house, but they do not live in it because it is very far from their work and school.  They live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nFlor has been a business person for five years.  She has an audio and video stand (she sells CDs and all types of music and movies), which is in a rented location.  She tells us that this season business is down a bit, but she is sure that it will soon improve.\r\n\r\nFlor has been working with the Foundation for eight years.  She tells us that the loans have allowed her to increase her business.  With this loan from the ESPOIR Foundation she will buy movies, musical videos, and educational videos, etc. to stock her business with merchandise for children and adults.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to see her children become good professionals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":410310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy movies, musical videos, and educational videos,  for children and adults","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor America","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":220,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.3,"local_amount":113.72,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":116.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789412},{"amount":24.33,"local_amount":23.78,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":24.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679858},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":28.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679859},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":28.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074430},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":27.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":28.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074431}],"funded_date":"2009-11-01T19:31:28Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":150400,"name":"Kanoumafin Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Kanoumafin est compos\u00e9 de six femmes mari\u00e9es majoritairement dans des familles monogames avec en moyenne 52 ans et 4 enfants.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Alma has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Alma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the fourth loan that Alma has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

By working hard in her pig-fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,500. Prudencia is now borrowing PHP 19,500 to purchase feed for her pigs.  This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Prudencia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been selling corn for six years and is able to earn PHP 7,280 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her businesses, Analyn is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan. She will use this money to buy essential ingredients to sell corn, such as corn, sugar, and margarine. She also plans to expand her business by selling other nutritious food such as sweet potatoes, peanuts, Indian mangoes, and bananas. The loan will benefit her greatly as it serves as the finances to sustain such business ventures.\r\n\r\nVacations are difficult for Analyn's business, as they are to other micro-entrepreneurs' businesses, since there are fewer customers. Nevertheless, Analyn works hard to make sure she helps her family with its daily needs. She continually looks for innovations or expansion in her business, because the bottom line is that she wants to become successful.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":741349,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is married to Tyron, a messenger, and is the mother to their child. Together with her husband, she manages their household while operating her business, working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMary Jane operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Mary Jane earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Aside from the store she has a food stall, where one can buy home-cooked meals. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 933 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 16,000. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. A portion of the loan will be used to buy quantities of products like meat, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Jane dreams of being able to give her child a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet every week. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":849235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-20T04:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":6400.02,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6793.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005403},{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4266.98,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4529.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764571},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4266,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4528.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571692},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1132.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529242}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T05:47:41Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eva van Emden","image":1021631}},{"id":331431,"name":"Houen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Houen, 56 years old, is a farmer with $8 per day for her income.

passion for working the land and making it produce.  He has many hectares of farmland outside of his community, areas which are quite far from his home.  However, thanks to his little horse, he can travel quickly and without difficulty to his small farm.  He tells us he has a great appreciation for his horse, who is also good company when he leaves very early from his house.  Fortunato is the one who supports his household, yet he is currently worried about his crops given his inability to use a fumigator.  This leaves them vulnerable to attack from pest infestations and disease.  It is for these reasons that he seeks a loan, so that he can buy a fumigator and the necessary fertilizers for his farmland.  <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":211059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a fumigator and fertilizers for his farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-07T19:50:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-21T23:04:03Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336083},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957279},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227529},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422764},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115987},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010948}],"funded_date":"2008-10-07T23:04:03Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":72459,"name":"La Victoria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo denominado La Victoria se inici\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2.008, entusiastas mujeres forman parte de un excelente grupo,  cuentan con una comisi\u00f3n bien conformada, el grupo es integrado por 16 se\u00f1oras, la mayor\u00eda de las integrantes realizan emprendimientos orientados al cultivo de: lechuga, tomate, perejil, acelga, rabanitos, etc. para su posterior venta al mercado, la mayor\u00eda de los pobladores de la zona donde ellas viven se dedican  a la horticultura.<p>\r\nLa clasificaci\u00f3n de actividades es como sigue:<p>\r\n1- Zunilda Ygnacia Q. \u2013 Venta de verduras.<p>\r\n2- Elena O.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

conformado por 13 socios, pertenecientes a la ciudad de Temuco. Ellos se dedican principalmente a la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de alimentos como sopaipillas, mote con huesillos, hot dogs, empanadas, churrascos, almuerzos y desayunos preparados, almac\u00e9n, minimarket, fotocopias y venta de muebles.\nLa socia entrevistada fue Damaris, quien es la secretaria de este grupo. En la foto se encuentra en el 4\u00ba asiento de izquierda a derecha en la 1\u00ba fila. Ella tiene un minimercado en su misma casa y es una herencia de su mam\u00e1. \nDamaris invertir\u00e1 este pr\u00e9stamo en comprar mercader\u00eda y apartar\u00e1 lo que le falta para hacerle un cobertizo a su negocio, para de esta manera prepararse para la lluvia del invierno. Su sue\u00f1o es ampliar su negocio y poder alg\u00fan d\u00eda entregarlo como  herencia a sus hijas. Tiene 2 hijas, una estudiando en 4\u00ba a\u00f1o medio y la mayor que le ayuda en el negocio. \nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Damaris de trabajar con Fondo Esperanza es conocer a m\u00e1s personas emprendedoras igual que ella, ya que as\u00ed aprende de las experiencias de sus compa\u00f1eros y se pueden aconsejar mutuamente. Adem\u00e1s comenta que le ha servido mucho la educaci\u00f3n sobre el manejo del dinero en el negocio.\nTemuco es la capital de la regi\u00f3n de la Araucan\u00eda. La ciudad se ubica a 670 kil\u00f3metros al sur de Santiago (capital de Chile) y posee una serie de balnearios lacustres y una flora y fauna nativa muy llamativas. Cabe destacar que en esta regi\u00f3n habita el 50% de los mapuches, pueblo ind\u00edgena, existente en nuestro pa\u00eds.\n\n\n","en":"This bank is called \u201cCamino al Futuro\" (Path to the Future) and is comprised of 13 members from the city of Temuco.  They primarily work in making food like \u201csopaipillas\u201d (a type of fried pastry), \u201cmote con huesillos\u201d (a traditional Chilean summer-time drink), hot dogs, empanadas, barbecued beef, and prepared breakfasts and lunches.  Some members have grocery stores, mini-markets, provide photocopies, or sell furniture.\r\n\r\nDamaris is the member that was interviewed.  She is the secretary of the group.  In the photo she is in the fourth seat from left to right in the first row.  She has a mini-market, which she inherited from her mother, in her house.  \r\n\r\nDamaris will use the loan to buy merchandise.  She will put aside what she needs to make a shelter for her business.  That way she will be prepared for the winter rains. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her business to be able to someday give it as an inheritance to her daughters.  She has two daughters.  One is in her fourth year of high school, and the older one helps with the business.\r\n\r\nWhat Damaris likes the most about working with Fondo Esperanza is meeting more entrepreneurial people who are like her.  That way she learns from her colleagues' experiences, and they can give each other advice.  She also says that the education about managing money in business has helped her a lot.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. The city is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (capital of Chile). It has a series of marshy spas and very colorful vegetation and wildlife.  It is worth stating that 50% of the mapuches, indigenous people, that exist in our country are living in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":521074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Beer, drinks, and some of the loan for a shelter from the rains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-04-09T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Ernesto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ram\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Constanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ferm\u00edn ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1141465,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74074},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":78910},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":79430},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":79963},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80496},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":78897},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83460},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82108},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":82654},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83200},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83759},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84318},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":84877},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85319}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":148.61},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.69},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":437.76,"local_amount":232414,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":233497.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136672673},{"amount":608.04,"local_amount":322816,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":324320.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144706787},{"amount":564.13,"local_amount":299506,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":300901.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890321},{"amount":540.07,"local_amount":286729,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":288065.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159630704}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T02:36:56Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":196215,"name":"Melania Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  Se\u00f1ora.

M., is a rickshaw driver by trade.  He provides transport services to his passengers and earns income for the family. \r\nShe has given birth to three sons and three daughters. Her two elder sons are illiterate and do different works to financially support the family. Her eldest son performs his duty as a rickshaw driver. He drives a rickshaw on rent while the second son works at a gas station for a very little income. \r\nDue to their jobs, Sakina is able to send her younger children to school. She wishes that they could complete their education and make their futures bright.  \r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her eldest son. With the loan, her son will buy a rickshaw. If he has his own rickshaw, he will be able to work longer hours and earn a good income. \r\nShe is very hopeful that by purchasing a rickshaw for her son, her family\u2019s living standard will be improved. \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 3rd loan application. In previous loan years, she has proved herself as a responsible client and paid her installments on time. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":624044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy a rickshaw","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Kasur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.115556 74.446667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-10-23T21:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sakina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phaban","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khursheed","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":6850},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182495305},{"amount":79.91,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630240},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191373147},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790579},{"amount":79.91,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232409},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:53Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098829},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169232},{"amount":79.91,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216451976},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615931},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":6850,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6865.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985059},{"amount":75.83,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":6514.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232743904}],"funded_date":"2010-10-24T02:13:33Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:20:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catherine Jenks","image":265268}},{"id":245387,"name":"Yoem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yoem C., 36, is a villager who lives in Kompong Tom Province.

However, in spite of the problems and difficulties, she works very hard to care for her 10 year-old daughter Aime, with whom she lives in a rented house in the town of La Merced.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working woman, in spite of the difficulties she has suffered, continues working hard since she says that she would like to be an independent woman and she has a lot of plans for the future.  One year ago she started running a public telephone business where people make calls to different places in Peru and elsewhere in the world.  This business is very profitable since her premises are in a strategic location.\r\n\r\nTania mentions that she is thinking of buying out her partner in her public telephone business so that she doesn't have to depend on anybody.  She is certain that with the support of her son Harry, who lives in the capital, she will be able to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nThis is Tania's seventh loan from MFP and she feels grateful for all the support that she receives from the other members of her community bank.

They have 2 daughters: Nicol and Sherly, who they are bringing up with great love in their own home. With the vitality of youth, he works at a variety of jobs during the day. He learnt to farm when he was young, and when he was only 14 he began farming the land that he inherited from his father. With time, he added new products to his harvest, such as: potatoes, peas, a root vegetable called olluco, and beans. He tends this with great dedication: he likes to plow the earth and sow the seeds that will grow in the following months. He doesn't like having to haggle over the prices in the main market in the town of Tarma, where he sells his produce. At the same time, he also raises livestock and has 4 milk cows. He makes 4 cheeses a day and sells them on Thursdays and Fridays in the markets that are held in his community. In parallel to this, he has 8 sheep which he is fattening to later sell for their meat at a good price to the local butchers. He is doing very well with his various businesses and he wants to save enough money to offer his children a better standard of living. He belongs to the community bank \"Los Pinos de Antabamba\" and this will be his second loan from MFP, from where he hopes to get the financial support to achieve his objectives. He promises to make the repayments on his loan once a month, as he did with previous loans. Cesar will use the money to buy 5 sacks of organic fertilizer to put on his pea crop, which is growing without problems.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cBackground:  The Daw Thiow group is a group of young tailors in Oussouye who have long been active in local development, having chosen as their business sewing and the sale of clothing.  \r\n<p>\r\nObjective:  To contribute to the care of our families and assure continued development of our association.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness activities:  Purchase of cloth and production of clothing for sale in the local community and region.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abContexte : : Le groupement Daw Thiow est un groupement des jeunes tailleurs Oussouye  qui travail depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps dans le cadre de d\u00e9veloppement et Ayant choisit  pour activit\u00e9 ; la couture et l\u2019exposition vente..<p>\r\n Objectif : Contribuer \u00e0 la gestion de nos familles et assoire une bonne politique de d\u00e9veloppement dans notre entourage.\r\n<p>\r\n Activit\u00e9s : Achat  de tissus et confection d\u2019habit vendu dans la commune et dans le  d\u00e9partement\u00bb\r\n<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":51464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cloth, lace, etc. for traditional clothing production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Oussouye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.5 -16.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-07-28T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Younous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-12T14:43:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63294},{"amount":190,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":190,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79992},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106850},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136683},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179275},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206865},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-11T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234735},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-07-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263545},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-08-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292466}],"funded_date":"2007-07-29T14:43:08Z","paid_date":"2008-08-11T09:00:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19203,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena has a little business selling a variety of items.

From 1987 to 1997, his business was prosperous and he increased his working capital to US$ 400. \r\n\r\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Equator province was invaded by the war from eastern Congo, and people were forced to leave their homes. He and his family moved to Mbandaka, the main town of the province. From 2000 to 2003, he continued running his business there with restriction due to the war. In 2004 he fell sick and was very often hospitalized for almost a year. He suffered from malaria and bronchitis. He used almost all of his business working capital for medical care. \r\n\r\nAfter recovering, Ferdinand decided to change his business and started to sell lamp oil in 2005 once again with a working capital of US$ 15. He worked very hard, and with good management he increased his working capital to US$ 300 in 2007. After learning through a friend about Hope\u2019s loan program, he decided to join one of its groups in the same year. \r\n\r\nFerdinand has already received five loans from Hope that he repaid correctly. With his next loan he plans to extend his business by adding others items such as bracelets and earrings. His dream is to purchase second-hand appliances from Europe and sell them in Kinshasa.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 47 years old. Lilibeth is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLilibeth is married and has 4 children. To make a living, Lilibeth owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Lilibeth has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nLilibeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilibeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Lilibeth is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Lilibeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma.Aileen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,500,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy products for the store to sell to customers. In addition to her business, she serves in her community as the Barangay Kagawad of their Barangay near to her home.  Ma. Aileen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

However, the output is rarely enough to satisfy the whole family. To help the difficult situation, two of her daughters decided to work as sewing staff in a garment factory in Phnom Penh and send a part of their monthly salary home to help their parents.\r\n\r\nIn the coming months, one of Chhun\u2019s children is going to get married, thus, Chhun will take responsibilities to manage the party. Consequently, Chhun would like to ask for some funds to prepare the wedding party of her child, which will come soon.

T. is 52 years old and native to the Matutuine district in the province of Maputo.

She grew up with her parents.<p>At 19 years old she married and had 6 children.  She has suffered great pains from the civil war between Frelimo and Renamo having been kidnapped by the enemy army, and even today the effects of the war continue in her memory.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to the access to credit she has been able to structure her life and without it her life would have continued to be very difficult.  With her activity she is able to support a family of 8 people, between children and grandchildren.  Despite having an official husband, he seldom helps the family due to his low monthly income.<p>With this loan of $1,125US she intends to purchase inventory both of new and different products following the necessities of her customers.  It should be noted that by her great entrepreneurship she sells on foot at different markets each week in the district of Matutuine.  In the future as her age increases she realizes that she is not going to be able to handle the various trips to sell at the markets so she intends to build a small commercial establishment in the village of Bela Vista.<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nRaquel T., de 52 anos de idade, natural do Distrito de Matutuine, provincia do Maputo, durante a sua inf\u00e1ncia n\u00e3o teve possibilidade de estudar, devido a distancia que tinha da casa para escola e sendo mulher por questoes culturas havia descriminacao entre filhos e filhas, tendo frequentado at\u00e9 3\u00aa classe.

The broom are made from a long grass which grows in the forest. People that live in the outskirts, especially along the railway, have businesses making brooms and selling them throughout Phnom Penh city. The couple began making and selling brooms in 1998. They have three children, all of whom are employed as garment factory workers.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>She told a loan officer that every month she needs to spend around US$80 on food and US$15 on utility.

Pictured here is 36 years old Tatu M. from Mbeya. She is married with three children who are between the ages of three and 10. \r\n\r\nTatu has been running a business selling used clothes since 1997. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers. These retailers then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost. Furthermore, western or modern clothing is becoming more appealing Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee and one family member. Tatu currently earns about 60USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to purchase more used clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of clothes and to open another business. Tatu thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more used clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Tatu N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maria is a coordinator for her group, La Nueva Esperanza (The New Hope), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nMaria has six children, and all but one have moved out of her home. Along with her youngest, a 15-year-old, Maria cares for a local 18-year-old girl who has a child of her own. Two of her children are currently studying in towns around the Dominican Republic, and the others now have families of their own. Maria lives in a batey called L. Blocks. Bateyes are communities built by sugar companies for their workers, and are usually very humble accommodations. Life in a batey can be harsh; they are difficult to access, receive no running water, lack sufficient sanitation, and have little to no electricity. \r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling vehicle necessities, including spare tires, oil, and gasoline. Maria also hopes to expand her business by selling prepaid cell-phone cards. Both her auto supplies and her cell-phone cards help the community have better access to the outsiD. world, and both are in high demand.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza, and she has been a hard-working borrower for over three years.

Juana works in her home crafting wool garments and other products. Nora also works in the crafting of wool, along with some of the other members who share this activity. Other members work selling sports clothing for women and children. Lourdes works selling stuffed animals. Others work selling salt at the open markets in the area. There are also members who work making jewelry from gold and silver. While there are other similar businesses in the area where the members are developing their businesses, the influx of consumer markets and the continued urban growth make it so that the development of their activities is not adversely affected; on the contrary many members are hoping to grow and extend their businesses which is why they are asking for a loan. The members are asking for credit to be able to buy goods in greater quantities; others to buy materials for construction to enlarge their small shops and to give better service to their customers; other to buy raw materials to increase their working capital. This group is in their second loan cycle and so most of them already know each other and have experience working with this type of loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":421732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise and raw materiales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T08:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia De","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":29900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5688.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5830.59},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5976.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6125.76},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6278.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":813.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":854.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":897.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2501.42,"local_amount":17495.32,"processed_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":17559.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678723},{"amount":875.84,"local_amount":6125.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6148.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073213},{"amount":897.74,"local_amount":6278.92,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6302.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909114}],"funded_date":"2009-12-14T00:39:50Z","paid_date":"2010-03-16T08:13:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Machelle Wilson","image":261196}},{"id":154591,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda A. is a 40- year old businesswoman from Baseco Compound, Port Area, Manila.

She lives in her parents' home, and wishes to help them with their household expenses. Although she is still very young, she has decided to work very hard so she doesn't have to depend on her parents; she feels it is time for her to get herself ahead. In order to do this, she makes woven handicrafts, which she sells from a booth in Explanada Laguna Temporal [Seasonal Lagoon Esplanade], a fair location in Juliaca. What she likes most about her job is weaving and making handicrafts. She has been doing this for two years, and she considers transporting the handicrafts to the sales point to be the most difficult part, as it makes her very tired. In the future, she hopes to have a large store for handmade clothing, where she can sell in a more relaxed manner and give better attention to her customers. This is Maritza's third loan with MFP. She has been very punctual in her payments and has never had problems with her communal bank, where she spreads joy that keeps the other members happy. With this loan of 3,000 soles, she will buy better materials to make more woven goods and increase the quantity she has in stock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":476188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials for woven handicrafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T19:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124522},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960263},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993107},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717893},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751568},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934036}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T06:09:17Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":175325,"name":"Ceferina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cerefina A. is a resident of Quisao, Tanay, Rizal.

He is married to Odette Nyonga and they are blessed with three children and all are below the age of 15 years old. He and the family live in a small house of three rooms. He lives in Nitop III, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nAdolf has faced some challenges in life. Amongst which are the inability to meet the basic necessities of his family, like clothing, feeding, transportation and educating himself and his children. It is difficult to raise capital to start up a small business that will sustain him and his family. He plans to invest this loan in a transport business, by buying a motorbike for transporting people and goods from one place to another. He believes the business will succeed because the previous loan he took was repaid by the income raised from an old bike of his, therefore he concludes that he is sure the business will succeed. He is certain that this business will succeed because the roads around the area of residence are poor, therefore the bike is a paramount way of transportation. The loan will help his community because they will be able to afford a considerable means of transport at cheaper fares. \r\n\r\nAdolf will plough back his profit into his business and use part to care for his family. He also will use the proceeds to pay his children\u2019s school fees and cater for the family. He prefers GHAPE because of the training he frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":614101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is 52 years old. Cerila is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Cerila owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, instant noodles, and snack foods in the local community. Cerila has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Cerila joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Cerila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Cerila is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Cerila from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

","en":"Manuel, age 54, lives in the village of Luis Vasquez in the San Pedro Sula municipality.  He has been married to his wife, Zulema, for 30 years.  She is a seamstress.  The couple has a 20 year old son and a 28 year old daughter.  The couple and their son contribute to the family expenses.\r\n\r\nManuel started as a paid helper in woodwork.  When he had the knowledge of how to work with the wood he decided to become independent in order to have better income for the family.  His family motivated him to become a contractor.  That way, with a lot of effort, he managed to have his own house.\r\n\r\nFrom his house Manuel makes carvings from all types of wood in order to make doors, closets, tables, and desks.  He also builds kitchen and bedroom furniture.  He also cuts molds for windows and doors.  He is an expert at his work because he has almost 35 years of experience.  He works ten hours a day laboring over his product.  He says that when there are blackouts he is not able to work.\r\n\r\nManuel has requested two loans from two previous cycles.  He has noted the improvements in the business, the increased stability, and the pride in his family.  Manuel has been able to offer better products and to build them more rapidly for his clientele.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 20,000 lempiras Manuel will buy raw material to continue his work making wood products.\r\n\r\nIn the future he foresees renting a place to put his business in order to get more contracts.  That way he will continue to manage improvements for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":913884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture
