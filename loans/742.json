Because her husband's salary is not sufficient to cover the family daily expenses and the purchase of a water tank, Laila needs to take a loan from FATEN in the amount of $2,000. Taking this loan will enable her to share the expense of purchasing a water tank that will help to irrigate crops well so the family will have better crops and increase their sales. This will also increase the family income and offer the family better living conditions.

She has been in this business for a period of one year and she got her initial capital from an informal rotating savings arrangment which her group used to have. This is commonly referred to as a \u201cmerry go round\u201d.   This is what she has been using to finance her business and ploughing back profits into her business.  She is 29 years old and married with two children.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHer business location is in a place called Maseno in the Kisumu district.  Her business is near a university (Maseno University) and most of her clients are from the university community.  She hopes to use the loan to increase her business stock so that she can carry more clothes in inventory of several varieties more consistently. This has been necessitated by the growing market due to increased dependence of the increasing student population on nearby clothes. Her clothes are preferred since they are cheaper than new clothes.  She also intends to diversify into selling juice after having established and learned that it is a fast-paying business in the locality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMaureen uses the proceeds from her business to supplement her family's income as her husband's income is small.  Her husband is employed in junior ranks and hence has little money to support the business.  She saves part of the income for her children and ploughs back the rest to the business. This is her first loan both for her and for the group.  She is a sub group leader and has displayed good leadership skills.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThough this is the first time the group is taking a loan, they have displayed a high degree of cohesiveness during group preparation and training.  All members of the group come on time and have shown commitment to follow group policies and procedures.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe location of Maureen's business is very strategic as it is close to the university student community who are most of her customers.  Most students and the community around can't afford to buy new clothes and hence her business has a high chance of growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4700,"image":{"id":96029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase stock of clothing materials.

This is 43 year old Leocadia M. from Mwanza. She is married with five children, between the ages of fourteen and twenty. Leocadia has been running a Furniture business since1990. Her business is selling beds, tables, and chairs. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by two employees. Leocadia currently earns about 300usd a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 1200usd in order to buy a wood working machine. In the future, she plans to increase her inventory of furniture stock. Leocadia thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":257015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy a wood working machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T00:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leocadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130725},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130726},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027514},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613515},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010594},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232880},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664680},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105411},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:39Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022556},{"amount":115,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":150937.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867805}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T01:30:45Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":88499,"name":"Luzviminda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Luzviminda A. is a pig farmer.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":320541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase items in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-17T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1001625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773321}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T20:14:42Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":113075,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonarda C. is a banana vendor.

What she likes the most about her work is to talk to her customers since this way her long working hours pass by faster. She has been doing this activity for 4 years. She considers having to sell during winter and autumn the hardest part of this work because the severe cold weather during these seasons has for may times caused her to be ill. Even so, she knows she must continue to work. \r\n<p> \r\nIn the future, she hopes that she will be able to rent a location where she can sell her \u201cpollimote\u201d more comfortably. This is Emiliana\u2019s first loan with MFP. She feels a responsibility to repay on time so that she can access another loan.

Wilfreda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Wilfreda is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to pay the tuition fees of her children.

This town has been long known for the unique beauty of its surrounding nature.  Tourists from many countries come here to enjoy the clean mountain air, skiing at ski resorts and also just look at the nature, mountain trees and majestic mountains of Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nTamara is fifty-eight years old.  She lives together with her husband, oldest son, daughter-in-law and youngest daughter.  Tamara\u2019s husband is retired and spent the last few years on permanent rest.  The oldest one is a taxi driver.  The second son is a student.  He goes to one of the universities in the capital.  The son\u2019s salary is obviously not enough for the whole family, and Tamara and her husband are involved in a domestic business.  They grow potatoes and milk, five to six liters, per day, and this yields them close to two thousand som per month.  Also, Tamara sells eggs.  Once Tamara and her husband took twenty tons of potatoes to Kazakhstan and successfully sold it.  They were able to buy a kashar (barn for livestock located at the bottom of the mountains near a pasture).  So everyone in the family stays busy.  Tamara needs some help.  She needs a loan in order to buy diesel fuel for field work.  It is needed to prepare the field for sowing potatoes.\r\n\r\nDjumakul S. is fifty years old.  She raised five children.  Djumakul tried to provide for her children all her life and to this day, finds no rest.  Even now, she works at a school as a server at a buffet.  Her salary is only eight hundred thirty som.  Djumakul\u2019s husband is involved in electrical and welding work, and one of the sons is involved in agriculture.  This is why Djumakul hopes to obtain this loan and help her son buy diesel fuel for field work.\r\n\r\nKenjekan R. is forty-eight years old.  She has six children.  The oldest daughter is twenty-seven, and the youngest son is eleven years old.  Kenjekan works at the village outpatient clinic, and the husband retired and does not work.  She hopes to get this loan in order to buy diesel fuel and help her son with field work.\r\n\r\nJyldyz U. is twenty-five years old.  She has two twin sons.  Her husband works as a tractor-combainer driver, and Jyldyz sells five liters of milk daily, which helps the husband support the family.  She requested this loan in order to buy diesel fuel for spring field work.  They plan to plant wheat.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":521307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of diesel fuel for field work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tup","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-04-20T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tamara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djumakul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenjekan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3517},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3832},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3953},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4092},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4397},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4606},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4758},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5025},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5290},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5530}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.15},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.73},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.16,"local_amount":3517,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3573.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715795},{"amount":85.15,"local_amount":3832,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3893.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748641},{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":3953,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4015.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931616},{"amount":90.93,"local_amount":4092,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4157.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670627},{"amount":97.71,"local_amount":4397,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4467.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884277},{"amount":102.36,"local_amount":4606,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4679.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151410},{"amount":105.73,"local_amount":4758,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4833.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446442},{"amount":111.67,"local_amount":5025,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5105.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585628},{"amount":240.44,"local_amount":10820,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10992.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721499}],"funded_date":"2010-04-22T19:34:00Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:00:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":195871,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is widowed with eight children and all her children go to school.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Chuka area of Kenya. Today, this humble mother of three children sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \n\nDairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a humble time milking her cow and also feeding. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \n\nPeninah believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production.

But they have three children, the eldest two live elsewhere in order to study - they're currently living on land that her mother-in-law gave them while they acquired their own.  Four years ago Lilia and her husband decided to set-up a business buying and selling fruits and in all this time they have realised that it is very profitable.  While her husband continues to work with the citrus fruits (previously they only worked growing fruit), she selects the fruits and prepares the packing of the product, that she takes three times a week to a market in Lima.  Lilia wants to make the most of her business, with the aim of buying and building their own house in a bigger town.  On the days when she goes to sell their products she earns between 150 and 200 soles, from which she pays the rent, the hire of her stall and buys food for her home.  During all this her husband prepares oranges from their land which had been planted 5 years ago and today they harvest the fruits of these plants in order to pay for the further education of her children.  This is her 5th loan con MFP, of which she has been able to make repayments without any delay. The money which she is asking for will be invested in the purchase of fruits in big quantities so that later they can sell them boxed-up, as this way they'll earn more than normal.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":257082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fruit wholesale for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T12:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228401},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423636},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116905},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011826},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595420},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989667},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210790},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640419},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080083},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":102.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996403}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T12:36:53Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":88515,"name":"Saweda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 56 years old. In 1973, after graduating from high school, Olga entered accounting school.  Later, in 1983, she started studying Russian Language and Literature at the Institute of the Humanities.  In her senior year, Olga married and her sons were born one after another.  In 1987, after she graduated, Olga was sent to teach Russian in Boroldoy villiage.  After working there for more than six years, Olga decided not to return to Bishkek but to live in the village. In spite of the fact that Olga's family was city dwellers, once they got to the country they built themselves a family farm.  They bought a calf, then a cow, and they cultivated a small plot of land that the rural administration has allocated for growing feed. \r\n\r\nOlga\u2019s hardest time was 2004.  Her eldest son died, and then a bit later, her husband died of a heart attack. In a short time Olga lost two of the closest people in her life.  After her son and husband died, Olga found herself unable to function.  Eventually, her teaching work gave her reason to continue living. \r\nIn January, 2010 Olga applied for her first loan from Bai Tushun and Partners, and received 30,000 som (KGS) which she used to buy cattle. Now Olga\u2019s family farm contains two cows. Olga plans to take out a second loan for 60,000 som (KGS) to further expand her herd.\r\n\r\nOlga believes that her students will attain greatness in life and become some of the world\u2019s most outstanding figures.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":756572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her husband works in Costa Rica, which helps her because of the monthly remittances he sends her.\r\n\r\nShe began her business with her own efforts when she went to Costa Rica to work, but she had to return because she couldn't neglect her children.  With her small savings she bought a refrigerator and began selling flavored ice cream and sodas, and as her business grew she invested in buying other types of products to sell, such as sweets, bread, cleaning products, and soup.  It has gone very well for her.  Today she has had her store for five years, and little by little she has gotten back on her feet.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy rice, sugar, oil, cosmetics, canned goods, and bread.

Nder is a tiny farming village on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, whose colorful history as the capital of the ancient Wolof kingdom of Walo is still celebrated in Senegalese folklore.  In this arid region, profitable cultivation of Nder\u2019s main crops of yams and peanuts relies on irrigation, but capital for investment in irrigation pumps has always been scarce.  The Gouye Ngalla association therefore submitted the following application for a microfinance loan: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe state having established a general support framework for community development associations since the 1960\u2019s, our group quickly realized that grassroots community development will not be a reality unless our members are effectively mobilized and organized for this purpose.  Taking into account the extremely difficult socioeconomic context characterized by: 1) migration out of rural areas due to the lack of promising local development alternatives, and 2) The absence in the Di\u00e9ri zone of any hydro-agricultural system established by the state or managed by the local government, the group rolled up our sleeves and decided to rely on our own efforts and on those of our strategic partners in order to achieve our goals. <p>\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to provide the members of the group with a motorized irrigation pump with a capacity of 300m3\/hour, which can irrigate 10 hectares of fields and will be managed by a pump attendant who will ensure its maintenance and proper functioning. <p>\r\nThe team responsible for this project will keep track of its progress and will begin to repay the loan without difficulty as soon as the first harvests begin.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French : <p>\r\n\r\n\u00abL\u2019\u00e9tat ayant d\u00e9fini le cadre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019intervention des associations de d\u00e9veloppement depuis les ann\u00e9es 1960, \u00e0 cet effet le groupement a vite compris que le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 la base ne sera une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que si les membres ne seront fortement mobilis\u00e9s en s\u2019organisant en cons\u00e9quence. <p>\r\nCompte tenu du contexte socio \u00e9conomique tr\u00e8s difficile marqu\u00e9 essentiellement par : <p>\r\n\u2022\tL\u2019exode rural faute d\u2019alternative de d\u00e9veloppement endog\u00e8ne prometteuse. <p>\r\n\u2022\tAbsence d\u2019am\u00e9nagement hydro agricole con\u00e7u par l\u2019\u00e9tat et g\u00e9r\u00e9 par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u2019encadrement dans la zone du Di\u00e9ri ; le groupement s\u2019est retrouss\u00e9 les manches, pour compter sur ses efforts propres et sur ceux de ses partenaires strat\u00e9giques pour atteindre l\u2019objectif qu\u2019il s\u2019est assign\u00e9. <p>\r\n\r\nObjectif du Pr\u00eat : <p>\r\n\r\nIl s\u2019agit de mettre \u00e0 la disposition des membres du groupement un groupe moto pompe d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 de 300m3\/heure pouvant irrigu\u00e9 10 ha de culture et sera g\u00e9r\u00e9 par un pompiste qui assurera l\u2019entretien et le fonctionnement. <p>\r\n\r\nPour le Remboursement : <p>\r\nL\u2019\u00e9quipe de suivi du projet fera des descentes dans tous les projets et d\u00e8s la fin des premiers r\u00e9colte commencera \u00e0 faire le recouvrement des cr\u00e9dits sans difficult\u00e9.\u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground : <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

Since he and his wife are unemployed, selling sheep is the only  source of income in his family. Mutton is in very high demand all across Azerbaijan and people use meat in their daily life. During all summer Mammadkhan grazes his herd on the mountain. He lives on mountain alone from June to August. During those three months the sheep are getting fat and they can be sold for a higher price than they were purchased. \r\nMammadkhan works very hard to cover all his family's  needs. However it is getting harder to keep such a big family each year. Now he has decided to establish financial income for  his family and increase the number of sheep in his herd.

Victoria thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, sugar, cooking oil, soaps and beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T20:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130740},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027528},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613529},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010608},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232894},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664691},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105418},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022563},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867812},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52543.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757013}],"funded_date":"2009-02-13T23:58:26Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":92627,"name":"Ismoiljon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Since he was very young, T.

Ever since he was young, he imagined he\u2019d be in the business of selling produce. And, fortunately, he realized this dream. At the age of 26, he began to sell vegetables in small markets. Nevertheless, little by little, he saved money so he could set up his own shop. Thanks to his efforts and the love he has for this business, Ismoiljon\u2019s business has been growing gradually. Nevertheless, Ismoiljon believes it is the time to inject more capital into the business so that he can buy at wholesale and obtain better prices. As a result, he is soliciting a loan of $ 1100 USD, which he will repay in 6 months.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zokir is 31 years old. He is married with 3 children. For more than 10 years, Zokir has been working at baking \u201clepeshka\u201d- traditional bread. He believes that this business is profitable and is not subject to seasonality. He  gets up early and bakes the lepeshka and other bread so that people have the fresh bread on their tables for breakfast. All the input materials like  flour, salt, and yeast he purchases in the local market. <P>\r\n\r\nNow due to high demand, Zokir wants to increase the number of his breads he bakes so he is requesting a loan of 6500 Somoni. The loan will be spend for purchasing flour and charcoal for baking the \u201clepeshka\u201d.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jennelyn is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn July 2009, Jennelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jennelyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jennelyn from HSPFI.

His business is located at his home and has been working in this type of business for 8 years. Thanks to his income he has been able to cover his families costs and other obligations. It should be noted that Senor C. suffered an accident on a machine while he was working for box manufacturing factory packing Puros. He cut four fingers on his right hand and it was there he felt it was time to look for another source of income as he couldn\u2019t continue working there. Until now, he has supported his wife and 4 children, some of whom, with lots of sacrifice, have managed to graduate and  others who are still studying. He needs to replace his corn grinder. \r\n<p>\r\nEsteban S.\u2019s income generating activity is selling different flavor ice creams.

This is what Marjorie C., 32, seeks to prove in her life. She reached high school and is now an entrepreneur and mother to two children who are both in elementary school. Her husband, Ritchie, works as a cutter in a restaurant. Their family currently resides in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nMarjorie sells fresh fish to her community. She also sells fashion accessories to her friends, neighbors, and business acquaintances. Her four years of experience in these businesses give her the skill of knowing the tastes of her valued customers. These business efforts enable her to earn 6,200 PHP monthly. \r\n\r\nTo help continue operation of her businesses, she would like to request a 10,000 PHP loan. This money will truly help her grow her business as it will give her the capability to purchase more fish, as well as quality accessories for her customers. For Marjorie, this loan is one step toward improving and eventually expanding her business.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of challenges surrounding Marjorie, so much that she considers her life in flux. The turmoil they have at home and with the rest of her family seems to rob her of the peace and focus she should be having in her business. She is also concerned with her husband, who just got in an accident. Adding to these burdens are the customers who run away from their debts. Still, despite all this, Marjorie strives to fix her eyes on God, the source of her inner peace. She prays for increased savings as her business becomes prosperous. She also never stops praying for a good life and a better future for her children. Marjorie also desires to have her own house and lot.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":713519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fish and fashion accessories for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-16T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marjorie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2906.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814241},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2906.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256806},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2906.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123499},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1999.96,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2179.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194781}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T08:55:23Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":277852,"name":"Dolgorsuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dolgorsuren is 34 years old and lives with her parents and son in Uvurhangai province, Mongolia.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

What she most wants is to offer her family a better quality of life. Since she was very young, Delia has had a taste for clothing. This is why, over the course of time, she decided to work selling clothes. She currently has a hard work week, taking clothes to sell in the different areas around the departments of Ayacucho and Cusco, as that is where she gets the best prices for her clothes. It is her responsibility to buy and transport her stock from the city of Lima. What she most likes about her work is showing her customers what is in fashion in the different cities of Peru, as she feels that this gains her the confidence of her customers. She has been doing this work for 33 years and thinks that the most difficult thing is having to transport heavy bundles of clothes to different markets, but, even so, she is not defeated as she knows that her family depends on her doing this work. She will use the loan she is requesting to buy more clothes, and she will have to travel to Lima to select good quality clothes and she hopes to be able to depend on the support of her financiers. In the future, she hopes to have the same strength, and so she has asked the Almighty to keep her in good health so that she can keep working with the impetus that characterizes her. This is Delia's second loan, and she is very happy to know that she can count on the support of her financiers once more. She is an active member of her community bank.

He worked in an insurance company for ten years but the company went bankrupt. In order to meet his family's needs, he then started to work as a construction worker. Prior to his involvement in this business, Yermias gained some training in carpentry.\nYermias decided that he could not depend on his income as a construction worker because it was unstable. He therefore started another business selling pigs to generate more income. He has been running the business for years. He is now thinking of expanding the business by raising chickens. He would like to purchase two boxes of chicks and fodder. Therefore, Yermias is requesting a loan from Kiva partner TLM amounting to 3,000,000 IDR. He is hoping that his loan application will be approved by TLM soon.\n

Ser madre y negociante son dos actividades que tiene que desarrollar todos los d\u00edas, sin descuidar ninguna de ellas. Se levanta de madrugada para preparar los alimentos y los \u00fatiles de sus hijos a quienes acompa\u00f1a todas las ma\u00f1anas al colegio, para luego salir a su puesto dentro de una galer\u00eda donde vende ropa. Esta actividad es muy agotadora por la gran concurrencia de personas, pero en estos dos a\u00f1os ha tratado de adaptarse a este negocio, el cual es muy rentable, pues el precio con el que adquiere su mercader\u00eda es c\u00f3modo y le da la facilidad de vender a un costo mayor que cubran sus gastos de inversi\u00f3n, sin la necesidad de elevar los costos por prenda, siendo accesible para las personas de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos. Con el tiempo, Rosa tiene planeado tener una cadena de tiendas para vender y administrar  su negocio en diversos lugares de su ciudad. Ella es cliente de MFP desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, este es su treceavo cr\u00e9dito, y le agrada el equipo de trabajo que conforman en su grupo. Solicita este dinero porque quiere mayor cantidad de prendas de vestir para venderlas y tener gran diversidad de modelos que llamen la atenci\u00f3n de sus clientas, quienes cada vez son m\u00e1s exigentes por la moda que es tan cambiante.","en":"Rosa is 36 years old, married and lives with her two children in her mother-in-law\u2019s house.  Her mother-in-law included a room in her will for her son and family to live in.  She must be mother and businesswoman every day without neglecting either activity.  She gets up at dawn to prepare the food and school materials for her children.  She takes them to school every morning and then goes to her stall inside a mall where she sells clothes.  It\u2019s a very tiring job dealing with a large number of people but she has tried to adapt to it in the past two years.  The business is very profitable since she gets the merchandise at a convenient price to easily sell at a higher price and cover her investment costs.  She doesn\u2019t need to increase the cost of the clothing so it is accessible to people with few economic resources.  Rosa plans to have a chain of stores to sell clothes and run her business in different parts of her city.  She has been a client of Microfinanzas Prisma for 7 years.  This is her thirteenth loan and she likes the team that makes up her group.  She is requesting this money because she wants a larger amount of clothing articles to sell and a greater diversity of styles to get the attention of her customers.  They are more and more demanding with fashion that is always changing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":291382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T21:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":115.23},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125.32},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":130.1},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":136.8},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":142.97},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":149.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.61},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.03},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.61,"local_amount":115.23,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":124.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012286},{"amount":43.08,"local_amount":125.32,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":135.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595868},{"amount":44.72,"local_amount":130.1,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":140.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990135},{"amount":47.03,"local_amount":136.8,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":147.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211261},{"amount":49.15,"local_amount":142.97,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":154.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640771},{"amount":51.41,"local_amount":149.58,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":161.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080233}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T23:18:09Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":100835,"name":"Faustina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustina A. is 27 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 6 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Janice owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fried foods in the local community.  Janice has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately $850 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2004, Janice joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Janice has successfully repaid a previous loan of $2000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  Janice is now requesting a new loan of $2000 WST which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Janice plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Selling of used shoes is a very big market in Ghana as brand new cloths are very expensive for the economically active poor. In addition, second hand shoes are seen as being of higher quality and more durable than the store shoes. Therefore selling used shoes has created a market for many Ghanaian women like Christiana. She takes stock of her goods from the nearby city center called Kumasi and she started her business two years ago. She wants to use the loan to buy more shoes to increase her inventory. She believes this loan would help her to save more for her children\u2019s education and to rent a store for her business.\r\n\r\nShe is the leader of a trust bank group called \u2018Anigye\u2019 which literally means joy.

She lives with her children; Omar, 20; and Katy, 27.  Her older children; Sime\u00f3n, 38; and Joel, 33; are independent.\r\n\r\nShe has been making handicrafts for four years.  She learned how to do this by going to a training shop.  From the first moment, she liked the work.  She is very happy with the scheduling freedom that she has and the enjoyment she gets from doing the work.\r\n\r\nShe is currently working on an order for party clothes for the Gamarra business center, which is one of the most well known centers in the city of Lima.  Her primary job is decorating the clothes with beads.  The good part is the Cervandicia do not work alone.  She has six people who help her embroider; she could not finish the large quantity of clothes by herself.  This work requires good eyesight and patience to be able to put each bead on the needle and give it a pretty finish.  Each outfit takes an hour, and it takes almost all day to complete a good quantity.  Cervandicia will continue to work hard to expand her business and have a larger shop.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She has always been very punctual with all of her payments, and she has not had problems paying on time.  She will use the money she is asking for to buy fabric and a larger quantity of beads and threads etc.  Every time their price increases, and it is better to buy them wholesale.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":350767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-12T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cervandicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77.06},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":81.54},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":84.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":90.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":39.87,"local_amount":113.9,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":121.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211984},{"amount":14.64,"local_amount":41.84,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":44.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641512},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":81.54,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":86.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080952},{"amount":29.69,"local_amount":84.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":90.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997093},{"amount":30.66,"local_amount":87.61,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":93.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842448},{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":90.27,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":96.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734012}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T01:59:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":125427,"name":"Normat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K. Normat is a humble man who earns a living in the cattle-farming business. He is the father of three children, who motivate him to work harder every day to be able to meet their needs. It is important to note that this business requires a lot of physical work, mainly because he needs to transport the animals from one point to another, crossing long distances under the exposure of the sun. This can cause illnesses and can weaken the body. Nonetheless, Normat continues to work hard and has now come to IMON International to obtain the loan that will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell in his area.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Eseta has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Eseta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Eseta is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Eseta is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Eseta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He depends primarily on the income from his farm to cater for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nMuhoi is 44 years old and married with 3 children, who all attend school.\r\n\r\nMuhoi has requested a loan of 55,000 Kes through Juhudi Kilimo, for poultry farming. This loan will allow him to buy layers and chicken feed, which will enable him to expand his poultry farming. The extra income from the the sale of eggs will help improve his family's livelihood. In the future, he would like to expand his poultry farm and raise broilers as well. He says that diseases and the high cost of chicken feeds against low prices of eggs have been his major
