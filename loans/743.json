The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is  Lwiza M. from Mbeya. She is 43 years old, and married  with 5 children between the ages of 15 and 25.\r\n\r\nLwiza, an orphan, has been running a genge business since 1995. A genge (grocery store) is typically a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nLwiza works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days a week.  Lwiza currently earns about $80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $300 in order to purchase items in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. \r\n\r\nLwiza thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania, through micro-leasing. The organization supports the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 35 years old. Marisa is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marisa raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Marisa has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marisa joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Marisa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase feed for the pigs. This will be the second loan taken out by Marisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":463266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase feed for the pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Clarin, Plaridel Mis.

Many young people have migrated to cities and other countries in the hope that they can help their families secure a better future.\r\n\r\nOur member makes a living raising animals--chickens, pigs, cattle--that she only sells when she needs money.  She also farms her land, growing maize mostly, work that she has done diligently for forty years.  The business hasn't grown, though, because she hasn't known how to do it.\r\n\r\nAna Maria, 60, has been a widow since her husband died of a brain tumor 12 years ago.  She and her husband had ten children, eight of whom are married and independent.  The other two, who are 20 and 17 years old, work at construction jobs, helping their mother when they can.  They also study at a night school.  Ana Maria is worried about her 20 year old son who is ill with no-one knows what and they have to spend money every month to buy the medications they hope can help him.\r\n \r\nAna Maria has been a member of her community bank for eleven years.

Her goal is to spend more time on the business so that she can expand it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":510319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy products to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-22T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"  Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946581},{"amount":78.34,"local_amount":77.83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":78.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674801},{"amount":180,"local_amount":178.85,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708977},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892273},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632658},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846721}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T01:03:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":191466,"name":"Kim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kim S. is 48 years old and she is a villager who lives in Svay Pear village in Takeo province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

D\u00edaz is an inhabitant of the municipality of Malambo. She owns a general store, which has been part of her plan for her life since she was very young. She started with a store owned by her mother, where she learned to appreciate independent work, and her efforts have become a basic component of her family life, her personal income and the sustenance of her household, which made up of her husband and their 4 children, ranging from 11 to 24 years old.\r\n\r\nShe began by independently selling a variety of merchandise when she got married, and she has gradually added display shelves and more products until the store became what it is today: a general store and her great legacy, which she protects with care, because it is a significant source of income for the development of her family and a model of entrepreneurship for her children. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and with her Kiva loan, she will buy household products, paper goods, cosmetics and fashion items which she needs to include in her range of merchandise. When she began with the Foundation, she started with $1,000,000 COP, which she gradually increased; today she hopes to receive $1,500,000 COP. Ana says that the loans from this organization have helped her to build up a credit history and buy a public transport vehicle, which today is another source of income for her household. In addition, her enterprising spirit has led her to create a business together with her children, in the field of water purification and technical disinfection. They offer this service to various companies, and she was also able to formalize the business through the Foundation with the Chamber of Commerce. In the three years that she has dealt with the Foundation, she has seen the increase in her capital reflected in better educational conditions for her children, and with respect to the business, better infrastructure, since she now has 5 display cases. Her main customers are her neighbors in the area. Her greatest dream is that her children will be able to finish their degrees at the University, and that they will continue strengthening themselves as businesspeople, which will make them very independent. Her greatest challenge is controlling the family's expenses so that they are not excessive and end up consuming not only her earnings but also her business capital.

La tienda de Teodocia es una de las m\u00e1s visitadas en la ciudad de Tarma, desde muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana abre su tienda en espera de que sus vecinos lleguen a comprar las cosas que necesitan. Ella es una vendedora muy alegre y atenta, ya que siempre recibe a sus clientes con una sonrisa y esta dispuesta ayudarlos en sus compras. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es conversar con sus vecinos, lleva 11 a\u00f1os en este negocio y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda dentro de su tienda sin poder salir. Con el tiempo, espera poder ampliar su tienda y llenarla de m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, para poder ofrecer a sus clientes una mejor variedad de productos. Es el noveno cr\u00e9dito con MFP y esta dispuesta a pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a su banco comunal, donde es muy querida por el resto de sus socias.

She opens her store very early in the morning and waits for her neighbors to come and buy whatever they need.  Teodocia is a very cheerful and attentive saleswoman.  She always greets her customers with a smile and is ready to help them to make their purchases.  What Teodocia most enjoys about her work is chatting with her neighbors.  She has been in this business for 11 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to remain in her store all day without being able to go out.\r\n\r\nOver time, Teodocia hopes to be able to expand her store and fill it with more merchandise, so that she can offer her customers a better range of products.  This is her ninth loan with MFP and she is ready to make her repayments on time since she doesn't want to cause trouble for her community bank where she is very well liked by the her fellow members.  Teodocia will use the 2,000 Peruvian soles she has requested to buy more products in order to better stock her store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":739559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She sells mineral water so that people do not have to drink water from the faucet. And because many families typically cook their own meals at least three times a day, Nena saw the opportunity to sell liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to meet their cooking needs. She has been in business for ten years and manages without hired employees. Every month she earns Php10, 000. Because she needs  financial help for her business, she has applied for a Php 25,000 loan. She will use this money to purchase grocery items, mineral water and stocks of LPG. She believes that increasing her inventory will lead to a more successful business. \r\n\r\nNena is determined to work hard and love what she is doing to bring the success she strives for. It is her dream to make her business prosper and expand in the future. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

one of the produce markets in Ivano-Frankivsk.  He previously worked at a brick factory, but was forced to find work at the market after the factory closed down.  Currently, Ivan sells vegetables, such as potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and also seasonal and nonseasonal fruits, citrus fruits, and also fish in the winter.  He always offers a wide variety of fruits and vegetables at low prices, and besides, there are not many competitors with similar products at the market.  Ivan has been involved in selling products for four years.  His monthly income is 7,000 hryvnia.  Previously, this market, where Ivan works, was disastrous.  Recently, however, local government decided to legalize and beautify this market and subsequently started to build neat kiosks-booths, each one of which costing 25,000 hryvnia.  Ivan wants to invest the money, received from Kiva, into the purchase of a new retail kiosk.  He needs to pay his first installment for the kiosk soon.  Ivan plans to work in the new kiosk, and his wife would work in the old kiosk, which will be relocated elsewhere.  As a result of this expansion, Ivan hopes that his sales will increase by 1.5-2 times.  In the future, Ivan wants to purchase a car, which is becoming more and more necessary for running the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":912731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is married and has two grown daughters. After graduating from a college of commerce, she started working as a market vendor. Today she runs her own business selling scarves and swimwear in the central city market. Presently, Tatyana has about $1,000 of working capital. Her monthly profit amounts to $150-200. \r\n\r\nTatyana has been in this trade for five years now. There are very few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Tatyana has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Tatyana has established a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity. She has repaid every loan she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any defaults.     \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan for $800 to re-stock her inventory before the spring\/summer season. She is planning to purchase bright silk, chiffon and satin scarves, soft shawls and one and two piece swimsuits. Compelling prices and a wide range of fashion choices to suit every taste and lifestyle will attract many new clients to Tatyana\u2019s business. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and pay for her daughter\u2019s college tuition. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0422\u0435\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u2013

Every morning she bikes around 20-30km away from home to nearby villages to collect recycles.  She then sells it to the recycling company, earning 3-4USD a day.  The change in income is not a whole lot, but at least it's stable.  This year Mrs. H. decided to open a small breakfast restaurant.  The job is rather difficult, but the good thing is that she will not to go too far every morning like before, which is better for her age.  Furthermore, her two kids can also help out in their free time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.

Maryjane has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Maryjane is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Maryjane from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Vilma M., one of CCT's community partners, not only sets high expectations but also takes concrete steps to achieve them. Vilma, 48, graduated from college and is married to Diomedes, a Philippine National Police (PNP) officer. Together they have four children, one of whom does not yet attend school. The three others are already studying.  The family lives in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nVilma runs both a carinderia (street-side food stall) and a sari-sari (variety) store. She caters to the physical needs of her neighbors with cooked meals and retail items like soap, shampoo, and seasonings, among others. Every day, Vilma earns around PHP350 with these two small-scale enterprises.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her businesses, Vilma would like to apply for a PHP17,000 loan. She will use the money to keep her carinderia in good shape and to replenish the stocks in her sari-sari store. Vilma envisions transforming the small store into a big grocery. Vilma also wants to raise chickens and pigs for additional income.\r\n\r\nVilma does not highlight her trials but keep focusing on her expected outcomes. Ultimately, she wants to see her family's home renovated and her children graduating from college.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":652642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She and her husband have two children who are 17 and 22. They currently attend school.\r\n\r\nShe runs a retail business in Kwa Zulu Natal of Emandini in South Africa and sells live chickens and cold drinks at her home. She explains that she has been in this business for three years.

This is why she has become the main source of support in her house, and she had to postpone her dream of becoming a great professional for awhile.  Her wish is to have a career after finishing her secondary studies, and this is what drove her to work in a shop that manufactures sweaters, where she offers her sewing services.  She works every day from very early to very late and is one of the most outstanding workers in the shop.  Nancy is very happy because this work that she does lets her save to be able to start studying at the university in her beautiful city.  Nancy hopes to continue supporting her parents and to support her studies, and this is why she is requesting a loan of $200 to invest in a small sewing shop in her parents' home.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":319946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Secretarial

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

En la actualidad solicita un cr\u00e9dito  $ 1.500.000  el cual ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de hilaza para hamacas, hilo fino para bolsos y lana para elaborar mochilas y comprar mercanc\u00eda como ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos y calzado que adicionar\u00e1 a su negocio. \nLa mayor parte de la ni\u00f1ez de Olga la vivi\u00f3 en un corregimiento de San Jacinto Bol\u00edvar llamado Bajo Grande hasta sus 10 a\u00f1os, de donde fu\u00e8 desplazada y huy\u00e9ndole al conflicto armado que ocurri\u00f3 en ese momento, se vino a vivir a San Jacinto, pero hoy todo eso es parte de su historia. La se\u00f1ora Olga ha recibido dos cr\u00e9ditos con la fundaci\u00f3n, los cuales ha pagado muy bien. Su negocio ha servido de mucho a su familia, debido a que los ingresos de su esposo no son muy altos y ella siempre ayuda con los gastos del hogar.

Gracias a Dios est\u00e1n superando esta situaciones y espera un futuro m\u00e1s promisorio para ella y su familia. \n\n","en":"Olga Isabel P. A. is a 26-year-old woman with a 6-year-old son. They live in San Jacinto, in the department of Bol\u00edvar, where she has been making handicrafts, such as hammocks, backpacks and bolis (frozen juice pops) for the last 4 years.  She is currently requesting a $1,500,000 COP, which will be invested in purchasing hammock cord, fine thread to make handbags, and wool to make backpacks. She will also buy such merchandise as apparel, cosmetics and footwear to expand her business. <p>\r\nOlga spent a large part of her childhood living in a small town in San Jacinto Bol\u00edvar called Bajo Grande, until she was 10 years old and was displaced while fleeing from the armed conflict at that time. She then came to live in San Jacinto, but this is all a part of her history. Ms. Olga has obtained two loans, which she has already repaid, from this institute. Her business has been very beneficial to her family because her husband's income is insufficient and she always helps with the household expenses. Olga dreams of obtaining her own house, expanding her business, and in so doing increasing the family income. Her greatest challenge was having to leave her town in order to save her life because she had to withstand difficult moments and financial hardships. She and her husband now live in apart for job reasons. Thank God that they are now overcoming these difficulties, and she now hopes for a more promising future for both her and her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth

in San Jose, California. Before opening her own business, Monica spent five years working for a watch salesman at the market and refining her own sales skills. However, she worked long and difficult hours and did not retain control over the profits she made. In 2001, Monica decided it was finally time to become her own boss. Getting started was difficult, she said, especially figuring out things like permits, but she is glad she did. \r\n\r\nMonica\u2019s stall is now open for business Thursday to Sunday every week, and she has one employee who helps her on the busier weekend days. A $3,500 loan from Opportunity Fund will allow her to increase her inventory and consequently boost sales. To help manage the growth, Monica\u2019s husband, Paul, will begin working at the stall with her. Until recently, Paul made a living selling paintings. He explains that the market for artwork has suffered recently. The couple is excited to have the opportunity now to work together at Monica's stall. \r\n\r\n\"I already have the satisfaction of working for myself, but I hope my business grows more,\" said Monica when asked about her goals for the future. She is proud of her success and that it enables her to send money to Mexico to help her parents and to support her sister's education. While she has a few cousins in the United States, the rest of her family lives in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMonica first learned about Opportunity Fund from a brochure that a cousin gave her. Her experience has been very positive and she hopes to get a slightly larger loan in the future. \"I am very grateful to Opportunity Fund,\" says Monica, \"because I'm going to keep moving forward with my business.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":562744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Suemalo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Suemalo needs a loan of WST$2900 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Suemalo joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Suemalo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Sherzod is grateful to everyone supporting him.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Buenavista, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. She is 51 years old and married to Francisco P., a farmer. They are blessed with three children, one of whom has a family already while the other two are still attending school. One of Nieva's dreams is for her two children to finish their education so that they are able to earn a good income and help her in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nWhile her children were growing up, Nieva realized that she could not rely totally on the income her husband earned from farming. This is because it could sometimes be very volatile and dependent on so many external factors, including the weather, that may affect the volume of production. Added to this was also the increasing expense of educating her children. This is why Nieva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 so that she could access capital to start a general store. Using her loans over the next few years, Nieva continued to expand her operations, and began to include frozen products. She now earns an average monthly income of 12,000 PHP \u2013 a very respectable income that has been a great help in improving her family's quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her last loan, Nieva borrowed 11,000 PHP, which she used as additional capital for her general store and frozen products. She paid off that loan on time each week until it was fully paid. This time, she is borrowing another 11,000 PHP, which she intends to use to restock her general store and purchase more products to sell. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams, and earning the respect of people in their community. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" \u2013 to be called \"Honorable\" is a mark of respect that everyone hopes to attain in their lifetime.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":419770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To restock her general store and purchase more products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Valladolid, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T13:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3520,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3813.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849006},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1760,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1906.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739674},{"amount":10,"local_amount":440,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":476.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129094},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5280,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5719.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965890}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T01:37:59Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":153953,"name":"Delfina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She informs us that the government provides food for the children in addition to paying for the rental of her house.

This locality is recognized for its economic activity since here one encounters a large number of factories -- it's the industrial park for the city of Cuenca.\r\n\r\nRosa Ubaldina has been a member of this bank for 3 years, motivated by an ex-member of the little bank.  She has lived in her own house with 5 children, ages 20, 18, 15, 13, 10, in the Parque Industrial sector in the city of Cuenca, since her husband migrated to another country some 10 years ago to offer a better future for his family. \r\n\r\nRosa is 42 years old and for the last 2 years, she has dedicated herself to domestic matters in different homes of the locality.  She doesn't have a fixed schedule and only works 3 days a week.  On the remaining days she cares for a baby in her own house and takes care of activities in her own home.\r\n\r\nShe has benefited from various loan cycles in her communal bank and the money obtained was utilized for expenses such as education, basic food, etc.  With her new loan request she will pay the bills for basic services such as water, lights, and telephone.  Her goal is to travel in order to reunite with her husband and to work hard to advance her children. \r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica is 25 years old, the single mother of a 2 year old boy whom the father recognizes and helps maintain economically.  She lives in a family member's house with her son.\r\n\r\nShe has been working for 8 years with the Foundation and it was her mother who informed her of the benefits offered by the institution from the publicity available in her community.

This will be the eighth loan taken out by Rodney from CEVI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She lives in Brgy. Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She earns an average income of 20,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Ruby is now borrowing PHP 20,000 for home improvement.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Ruby aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She is 50 years old. Consolacion is married and has 9 adult children. To make a living, Consolacion owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Consolacion has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Consolacion joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Consolacion has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Consolacion is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Consolacion from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fidela C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Aigul is very child-loving by her nature, which helped her to choose an assortment of goods with close attention to comfort and style. Such an attentive attitude to all details of her business led Aigul to expand her business. She took three loans from Bai- Tushum and Partners, which helped her to make her business more successful. These loans were used as intended and repaid without any delays. \r\n\r\nNow Aigul is applying for a loan of 40,000 Kyrgyz Soms to broaden her assortment of goods. With the revenues, she plans to renovate her daughter\u2019s room. In the future, Aigul wants to open a big children\u2019s shop with high-quality products and service.

This brave and dedicated woman is a coffee farmer.  Every weekend she tends to her crops fertilizing them and removing weeds that grow among her plants.  She has been in this line of work for 4 years and what she enjoys the most about it is being able to dedicate time and effort to something of her own.  She sells each harvest of coffee beans at the Alto Palomar Cooperative.\r\n\r\nDany isn\u2019t just a farmer.  Three years ago she started working as an educational promoter for the Peruvian State\u2019s social services; she teaches reading, writing and ways of improving psychomotor skills of children older than 3 years.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is sure that all the members of the communal bank will be able to get ahead together.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy several sacks of manure to spread among her coffee plants.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":677505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-25T17:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dany ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718369}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T21:23:34Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":265268,"name":"Homero","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Homero G. is a business coach for entrepreneurs. He began \"G. NT, Inc.\" because he saw that people within the small business community needed assistance bringing companies to scale. He has always been interested in the difficulties that businesses face, so when he learned about coaching, he knew this was the perfect job for him. Homero says his competencies are in understanding growth and in teaching, which makes him a successful coach. He helps entrepreneurs build infrastructure in their businesses and teaches them about leadership and communication. He works individually with entrepreneurs to develop a program that is based on their specific goals and needs. Homero likes to work with a business for about a year in order to identify problems, talk through the issues, and implement solutions with the entrepreneur. He works with established businesses as well as emerging ones.  \r\n\r\nHomero says that the success and growth of the businesses he works with has to do with the commitment of the entrepreneur. As for his business, he is in the process of writing a growth plan. At the moment he is the only coach at the firm, but he is developing a framework to teach others how to coach. Homero wanted a loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana in order to help expand his presence on the web, which is another important way to grow the company.  \r\n\r\nHe describes his coaching as \u201cnot so much listening, but having the hunger to hear what people say in their own contexts.\u201d He was trained as a social scientist, so he has a strong theoretical background in organizational behavior that helps him succeed at his job. Homero deeply believes in what he does because he knows how important these businesses are to the entrepreneurs who run them. Small business owners invest their whole lives into building their businesses, which is why growth is so important for them.

Milcerio is a farmer, work that he's done for 30 years.  He tells us that before he heads out to his fields, he feeds his donkeys and horses--useful for carrying heavy loads at harvest time--and the 25 head of sheep that he owns.  He grows potatoes, olluco, beans and peas on 5 hectares of land and sells what he harvests at the Tarma wholesale market.  What most bothers him are the plants that he loses to frost and worms.  He doesn't dwell on the problems that he faces, though, choosing instead to fight and overcome them.  He will soon harvest a crop of Andean-variety potatoes and he's sure that he'll be happy with the results.  He's driven to work in part for his children, all of whom are good, hard-working young men and women and still in school.

He has been a solar lamp distributor for NOTS Lampes Solaire for the past three years.  Last year Daniel used Kiva funds to purchase solar lamp inventory worth $20,275.  He successfully paid back his Kiva loan and now hopes to increase the loan size to $53,000 in order to purchase 2.500 solar lamps from NOTS Lampes Solaire and sell them to cotton farmers on credit.\r\n\r\nPrior to selling solar lamps, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company. He started his own company because he believes that solar lamps are very useful for rural families who live in his region. Daniel\u2019s main customers are farmers from Sikasso, the southernmost region in Mali. The majority of his customers do not have access to electricity - they light their homes with kerosene, flashlights and candles instead.  To charge their mobile phones, they walk long distances to a kiosk and pay money.\r\n\r\nOn top of being dangerous, time-consuming and toxic, these energy sources are expensive. They cost a family about $80 per year or 10% of their annual income!  And during the rainy season it is even worse, as kerosene is often not available or is very expensive.\r\n\r\nA d.light solar lamp lasts for about five years and costs $25. Purchasing a solar lamp saves families time and money (about $375 over 5 years!) and is much safer and healthier.  The environment also benefits \u2013 no more toxic waste or dirty CO2 emissions. \r\n\r\nDaniel recently signed an agreement with the Union of Cotton Producer Cooperatives to promote solar lamps to the 15.000 cotton farmers in his region.  He conservatively estimates that he can sell 2.500 lamps to these farmers.  When the farmers sell their cotton harvest, they can pay Daniel for the solar lamp.\r\n\r\nYour Kiva investment will help bring light to approximately 10,000 lives and help Daniel to provide for his family and expand his business.

One of her daughters is 20 years old and works helping her mother, and her other daughter of 16 is currently in her 5th year of secondary school.

Her business is located in Honduras, and she has had it for the 24 years. Maria started with the business of washing and ironing for charge and with the money she made from this business, she invested in her new business. A friend of hers who had known about the clothing business started her off with 4 dozen pairs of pants, and later on she gained more and more clients. It is because she needs to satisfy these clients that the loan she is asking for will be used to buy products like backpacks and women\u2019s and men\u2019s pants, for which she will need to travel to Honduras in which it will be more feasible to acquire such products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":240767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T08:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858677},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399932},{"amount":69.88,"local_amount":1324,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1383.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091918},{"amount":35.67,"local_amount":676,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":706.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985315},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445926},{"amount":52.78,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956573},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T22:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3134.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174001}],"funded_date":"2008-12-20T08:16:35Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T22:53:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Capetola","image":null}},{"id":84159,"name":"K\u00e9w\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"K\u00e9w\u00e9 S., 40 ans est mari\u00e9e avec 05 enfants en charge.

Aside from her hawking business she also supplies home appliances like blenders, rice cookers and cooking utensils on credit to workers.\r\n\r\nAma says the selling of cosmetics is very lucrative and therefore she wants to expand her inventory to enable her to make a good income for her family\u2019s needs. Her dream is to be able to see her kids through education to the tertiary level as her legacy for her kids to aid them in their future lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":358164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cosmetics to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Kasoa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-07-24T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":70.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73670785},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":70.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87109360},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":70.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97025514},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":70.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103870058},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":70.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110759375},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":70.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118148080},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:59:32Z","rounded_local_amount":70.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123986218},{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":70.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017043},{"amount":47.2,"local_amount":66.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-23T08:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":70.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742113}],"funded_date":"2009-07-25T15:46:22Z","paid_date":"2010-05-23T08:00:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":129225,"name":"Valentine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentine is 33-years-old.

Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":586795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

C. is a widow who lives in the municipality of Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a butcher shop.  Emerita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emerita has been incrementally improving her family's quality of life by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000, which she intends to use to buy more meat to sell in the market so she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Emerita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has one son called Roberto who is 6 years old and currently in pre-school.  Oralia sells napkins for tortillas and for covering food.  She requested her loan to buy napkins and stock her business.  Oralia started her business three years ago.  It was her mom who taught her how to sell napkins.\r\n\r\nMany salespeople from different communities come to the Tepalcingo street market to sell their products.  It was there that Oralia saw napkins being sold by the dozen.  She used some savings that she had to buy several dozen napkins with which to start her business.  She started to sell her products in the Tepalcingo street market which is located in the town center, 15 minutes from her home.\r\n\r\nThis business is very important because it helps Oralia's family financially.  She feels proud to be able to work in her own business, take care of her young son and serve her customers in a kind and friendly manner.  She is happy to be receiving this loan from Kiva because she will use it to stock her business so that she can grow and have a range of different types of napkin to offer her customers, who are housewives.

Hoa","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Minh Phu is a partially mountainous area. The portion of soil suitable for farming is very small, thus, the people in this village is the poorest as compared to other villages in Soc Son. Before joining the TYM Fund, Mrs. N. Thi Hoa's family was one of the poorest, as their income came from just a small area of farm land and a few chickens. She wanted to purchase a cow to facilitate farming but did not have enough money. It was even more difficult to improve her family's economy. In 1998, she discussed with her husband and joined the TYM Fund to start borrowing money. Her first loan of 1,000,000VND (about 64USD) was used to breed ducks and pigs. After a while, her family's economy slowly improved, and the more important thing is that she was able to accumulate an amount of capital. Since 2003, she has always been borrowing the maximum amounts allowed to expand her model of breeding ducks and pigs, so her family's economy has continued to improve further. Currently, she has 10 pigs waiting to be sold to butchers and about 500 pigs giving eggs everyday so it is convenient for her to repay the loan. Her monthly income from raising livestock is about 5,500,000VND (about 354USD), part of it is used for her family's spending, so she has purchased enough basic household equipments. She could also afford to construct a concrete house and is now preparing to build a second storey. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150.00USD) to invest in raising livestock.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMinh Ph\u00fa l\u00e0 v\u00f9ng \u0111\u1ea5t b\u00e1n s\u01a1n \u0111\u1ecba, ru\u1ed9ng \u0111\u1ea5t tr\u1ed3ng l\u00faa \u00edt ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu l\u00e0 \u0111\u1ea5t g\u00f2 \u0111\u1ed3i n\u00ean cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng c\u1ee7a ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n n\u01a1i \u0111\u00e2y kh\u00e1 v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 v\u00e0 ngh\u00e8o nh\u1ea5t huy\u1ec7n.
