The community is distinguished for being full of ponds, there are ponds everywhere. The members of the group comment that the community is very big in territory and people, and for this reason it was divided into 3 localities a few years ago. Boreje 1st neighbourhood to which this group belongs, 2nd neighbourhood of Boreje, and Barrio el salto are the localities which were previously one. The members of the group are 7 women who work at home and at their businesses. Some of them raise chickens or sheep, and others have a grocery store. The people of this community of Boreje are very simple, respectful, and never refuse to greet anyone even if they don't know each other. The names of the 7 members are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.-Anatalia M. L., Mrs. Anatalia is 53 years old, raises chickens and has a grocery store.\r\n2.-Angelica S. M., is 35 years old and has a grocery store\r\n3.-Teresa F. Gonzalez, is 41 years old and raises chickens\r\n4.-Ma Julia S. S., is 40 years old and raises sheep\r\n5.-Maria Catalina A. Marquuez, is 65 years old and raises sheep\r\n6.-Florentina C. C., is 31 years old and has a mobile phone business\r\n7.-Maribel S. C., is 25 years old and raises sheep\r\n\r\nThe 7 women have known each other for a long time. Some of them are next-door neighbours, and others live a little farther away but they see each other daily. The members decided to call themselves by this name because they had chosen other names but they were all taken by other groups. They therefore chose the name of their community, and that's how this name was settled on. Mrs. Anatalia became the representative of this group and she tells us her story.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anatalia is married, currently raises chickens, and in her house she has opened a curtain to be able to sell soft drinks, snacks, and canned goods - a general store, in fact. Her children no longer live with her. She had 5 children; 2 have already married, 1 daughter is in a relationship, and two more work in Mexico city. They visit her every 8 or 15 days, depending. In her house are only herself and her husband, and what she earns is for the two of them. About her business she says that the chickens are no difficulty for her since she has experience taking care of animals. What worries her is the store, there are times when she gets discouraged because there are no sales, there are things that don't sell, and other days sell more or less. As the sales are low, there are no earnings and no more money to invest. What you sell is what you invest. She is requesting this loan to be able to invest more and sell more, so that people see the store full and can choose what they want to buy. Mrs. Anatalia's dream is to start selling fruit and vegetables because no one sells fruit and vegetables and she believes that it could be good in her business. Mrs. Anatalia's husband is a builder and only works when he can be contracted as well as in the countryside.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":691843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chickens and invest in a grocery store\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-17T17:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anatalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3007.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430841},{"amount":500,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6014.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850094},{"amount":500,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6014.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292368},{"amount":500,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6014.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160626},{"amount":250,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3007.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233504}],"funded_date":"2011-01-17T20:08:19Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa C","image":null}},{"id":269866,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is 34 years old and married.

The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \r\n\r\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \r\n\r\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit and then extend credit to their customers.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1449284,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2890,"youtubeId":"fPWuc5-0E1s","title":"Kiva Borrower AVEC-Mali from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1449284},"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Green"],"use":"to buy solar lamp inventory that they will sell in their communities.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Mopti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":28825,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avec-Mali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":14000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":28825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":14000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janessa Karawan","image":1204200}},{"id":672086,"name":"Igimbi Agahikaine Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Matia is a Ugandan aged 64 years married with twelve children and living with four of his grandchildren that he is taking care of in Kagadi.\r\n\r\nMatia deals in cattle and goat trade as his stable source of income and also from sale of produce.

Salim was born in 1968 in Khujand, Tajikistan. He is married and responsible for three people including his wife and two children.\r\n\r\nVery dynamic, serious, and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his flock and repair his enclosure. This will enable him to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, some of whom buy animals from more than 20 km from his village.\r\n\r\nWith this goal in mind, Salim is requesting a loan that will serve him as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments. \r\n  \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Women). She lives in a modest home with her long term partner. She says that her most difficult challenge is not having her own house and she wants to build one. She enjoys doing business and is excited to receive her first loan with Esperanza. She started her business when she realized she needed extra income and save US$90; she has now had her business for a year. Santa plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying chicken, beef and pork for her butcher shop. She will use the profits to buy a washing machine and to save to buy a vehicle.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate joined us because she wanted to improve her business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and the tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

San Francisco; por circunstancias de la vida no pueden tener hijos. Juan, es bien centrado en sus responsabilidades como esposo, sus padres a temprana edad le ense\u00f1aron la actividad del comercio y creci\u00f3 con esas dotes; hoy compra productos a los campesinos como: cacao, caf\u00e9 y frutas de la zona, actividad que viene ejerciendo desde hace 30 a\u00f1os de manera independiente. Una vez comprado dichos productos de cacao y caf\u00e9, son  almacenados hasta obtener una buena cantidad para luego transferirlos a las empresas acopiadoras en donde obtiene un buen porcentaje por cada kilogramo que vende. Esta actividad le resulta rentable, gracias a ello pudo comprarse muchos bienes. Actualmente cuenta con su propia movilidad lo cual le facilita el traslado de los productos hasta el centro del almacenamiento. Los meses de enero, febrero y marzo son \u00e9pocas de lluvia y derrumbes en las carreteras, eso obstruye el pase del producto, por el cual lo perjudica en el trabajo. Su plan pr\u00f3ximo y por el bien de su negocio es comprar otro carro, porque el que tiene es muy antiguo y ya no esta en perfectas condiciones por lo cual necesita uno nuevo para continuar con su trabajo. Este es su tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, ha sido muy puntual en sus anteriores cr\u00e9ditos; sabe que tiene que pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, para as\u00ed acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito en el futuro. Con mil nuevo soles renovar\u00e1 la fachada de su casa, para ofrecer el servicio de alquiler de habitaciones, ya que lo considera muy rentable. \n\n","en":"Juan H. is 52 years old and was born in San Francisco, in the department of Ayacucho. He is married to Fortunita, who is 60 years old. They have their own house on Santa Rosa Avenue in the district of San Francisco. Due to circumstances beyond their control, they are not able to have children. Juan is focused on his responsibilities as a husband. At an early age, his parents taught him sales and he grew up with this gift. Today he buys produce like local cocoa, coffee and fruit, which he has done independently for 30 years. Once he has bought cocoa and coffee, they are stored until he obtains a good quantity and later he transfers them to gathering companies and gets a good percentage for each kilo he sells. This activity is profitable because he is able to buy many goods. Now he has his own vehicle, which makes it easy to transport the produce to the storage center. The months of January, February and March are the season of rain and landslides on the highways, which blocks the passage of the produce and hurts his business. His new plan for the well being of his business is to buy another car, as the one he has is very old and not in perfect condition, thus he needs a new one to continue his work. This is his third loan from MFP, and he has been very punctual in his previous loans. He knows that he must make his payments punctually in order to get more loans in the future. With 1,000 soles, he will renovate the front of his house so he can rent rooms, which he considers very profitable.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":704263,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Restore front of house and be able to rent rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":73.24},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":73.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":76.18},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":78},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":81.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":90.4},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":96.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":99.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.88},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.6},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.19,"local_amount":67.18,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":69.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887282},{"amount":27.16,"local_amount":72.41,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":75.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327658},{"amount":27.6,"local_amount":73.6,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":76.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196193},{"amount":28.56,"local_amount":76.18,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":79.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269869},{"amount":29.52,"local_amount":78.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":81.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549886},{"amount":30.32,"local_amount":80.86,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:52Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718543},{"amount":31.73,"local_amount":84.6,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":88.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350011},{"amount":32.73,"local_amount":87.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":90.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850568},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":90.39,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:19Z","rounded_local_amount":94.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665800},{"amount":108.29,"local_amount":288.8,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":300.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620974}],"funded_date":"2011-02-01T01:36:22Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":273979,"name":"Boboto Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"R\u00e9gine is the leader of a community bank named \u201cBoboto Plus\u201d, made up of eleven members firmly united to receive loans from the micro-finance institution, HOPE DRC, in order to develop their businesses.\r\n\r\nR\u00e9gine sells shikwanges (a kind of bread made of manioc flour), which are Kinshasa\u2019s main food.

Her daughter, as noted, is the other member of the duo.\r\n\r\nMarta began the business with a little capital from the sale of jewelry. The business has done well and she is motivated to continue investing in it. Thus she needs capital to stock up on groceries.

It is in the La Banda de Silcayo district, San Martin province, San Martin Department.  She is 36 years old and in a common-law marriage.  She has an 11 year old son who attends elementary school.\r\n\r\nShe always lived in the countryside helping her parents along with her husband.  When her son got older and had to go to school they left to live in the city.  That is when she found herself needing to generate her own income by washing her neighbors\u2019 clothes.  She does this to support her husband with her son's education\r\n\r\nShe has been working with her communal bank for three years.  With her first loan she bought a grill to sell food that is roasted on the grill in the evenings.  In the mornings she buys and sells farming products at a market in the city.  She buys things like bananas and grains (bean, cacao, corn, and coffee) in order to continue generating income to contribute financially to her household and her son\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 1,300 soles from this loan to buy farming products (bananas, cacao, corn, and beans) in order to sell them in the mornings.  She will also use them as ingredients to prepare \u201cjuanes\u201d (seasoned rice wrapped in a green bijao leaf. Seasoning typically includes turmeric and cumin, giving the rice a warm flavor and a yellowish color. Most juanes also contain a small piece of chicken, a slice of egg and an olive or two), roasted on the grill  to sell at night.\r\n\r\nElza is a tenacious and enterprising woman.

has always been tied to the textile business.  His family has been working in clothing manufacture and sales for several years.  One of his brothers holds a sales position in a large commercial center.  It is for this reason that, after leaving behind his business of selling groceries for one and one half years,  Efigenio contented himself with the manufacture of hats and pouches.  He has spent three years already in this line of work.  It is not his first foray into the textile industry; before he worked selling groceries, he bought and sold ready-to-wear clothing.  Efigenio lives with his wife, who is employed as a domestic worker, and with his twenty-year-old son.  In the future he plans to continue with his clothing manufacture business, making it grow and contracting personnel when he installs more machines in his shop.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nEfigenio siempre ha estado vinculado al negocio de textiles.

Es por esto que, luego de dejar su negocio de abarrotes en el que duro a\u00f1o y medio, se animo a invertir en la confecci\u00f3n de gorras y canguros.

Nelly hopes to invest the money in maintenance of her motorcycle, which is very expensive because of the different repairs that it needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":230904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance of her motorcycle rickshaw","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-29T02:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594983}],"funded_date":"2008-11-29T06:13:51Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":80579,"name":"Harrison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harrison T. produces soap and sells it at Abrobeano near Elmina.

She works each day in their fields of crops, cutting the grass to sell to their neighbors who raise cattle.  They sell great quantities which allow them to have daily income for the family.  Because of this, Mauricia leaves her house early to prepare for her sales.  Each morning she goes to the town plaza with all the grass she has cut.  Therefore, it's not just her neighbors that buy from her, but also other people from areas farther away.  Mauricia's goal is to expand her reach by taking her grass to the city to sell it in a bigger market, allowing her to become a bigger trader of grass for animals.  Additionally, she would raise her own animals and spend more time helping her husband make bricks for a few hours each day.  This is the fifth time that Mauricia has taken a loan with MFP and she is very content with the service she has received so far.  Also, she has learned the habit of saving through the recommendation of other people that work like she does in a communal bank.  The amount she is requesting will be used to buy better grass cutting tools, to invest more in the transportation fee that she pays to move her packets of grass and to buy a milking cow.  The tools are valued at 50 soles, the transportation fee for one season will be approximately 300 soles and with the rest she will buy a cow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julie Lutz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":258559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cow and better tools for cutting grass","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-20T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3057.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080095}],"funded_date":"2009-01-20T03:03:42Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Lutz","image":270837}},{"id":88771,"name":"Ma.

She is 46 years old and married.  She went to school until the 7th grade.  She is the mother of 4 children with ages between 26 and 11, and the youngest 3 are in school.  Lina left Chibuto for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, when she was 14 years old with her oldest brother who was working for the registry office and was transferred to work in that district.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived in Namaacha Lina enrolled in school.  The following year she became pregnant with her boyfriend and had to interrupt her studies because at that time it was prohibited to go to school while pregnant.  She moved in with her boyfriend.  Two years later they married, and he abandoned her 5 days after the wedding emigrating to South Africa and leaving a letter that only was discovered 6 months after alleging that he went to search for work.\r\n\r\nLife became difficult and without knowing what to do she asked for help from her brother who arranged a job for her in the registry office as a servant where she worked for 5 years.  With the money collected she began her own business of selling capulanas [a kind of robe\/dress].  She buys them in Maputo and resells them in Swaziland.  Her business was growing, and she was unable to satisfy the demand of her customers.\r\n\r\nShe discovered our services [Hluvuku] and solicited a loan in the amount of 20,000MT to increase her inventory.  Today her best products are sheets, blankets, duvets, and curtains that she buys for 400MT, 500MT and 350MT, and resells at 1,000MT, 1,250MT, and 3,000MT respectively.  She has had a monthly income of 8,000MT per month and is able to save 3,000MT since she isn't responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan through Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The first two loans were used to purchase products (clothing, sheets, duvets, and blankets).  This time Lina intends to use 20,000MT to the same end and is confident that she will be able to pay it off before maturity so she can request another loan to finish the work on her kitchen.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":281255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and sale of various clothing and bedding","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lina J\u00falio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1054.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1102.6},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1152.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1204.54},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1258.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1315.9},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1375.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1502.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1570.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1641.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1715.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1793.23},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1874.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.79},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.22},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.61},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.48},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.88,"local_amount":1054.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1089.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27100749},{"amount":42.72,"local_amount":1102.6,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1138.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35994941},{"amount":44.66,"local_amount":1152.44,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1190.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44577717},{"amount":46.68,"local_amount":1204.54,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1243.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52971082},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":1258.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1300.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190909},{"amount":50.99,"local_amount":1315.9,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1358.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618790},{"amount":239.61,"local_amount":6183.43,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":6385.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056639},{"amount":86.27,"local_amount":2226.31,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2299.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971587},{"amount":174.39,"local_amount":4500.88,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4648.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816585}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T03:25:19Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":96963,"name":"Jamaima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jamaima E. has a small boat that she and her husband, Erlando, use to fish for a living.

Lydia's husband worked in a manufacturing shop that made household furniture from native materials, such as ratan. She sold relief goods, such as clothing, shoes, and bags, to people in their village. Felix received only a small profit from his output despite the hard work it entailed. Lydia's business was unstable because she did not have sufficient business capital. Because Lydia and Felix felt that they could not afford to live in Manila with its high standard of living and still send all of their children to college, they decided to return to their own province in Antique.\r\n\r\nBecause Felix had experience in furniture-making, enhanced by years of working in Manila, he and Lydia thought of opening their own furniture shop in the Province. Lydia agreed to her husband's idea and she was delighted once again, because she can have still her own business buying and selling relief goods while partnering with her husband in the furniture business.

They hired one of Felix coworkers from Manila to work with them. \r\n\r\nLydia believes that, someday, her loan from ASHI will make their business successful because she maintains an excellent record of repayment and attendance at center meetings.

She is widowed and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Sonia owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sonia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI, and is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Sonia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

On one side, he has a small field in which he usually plants lemons. In addition, raises animals to sell to dealers who often visit the area. With this work, Daniel helps his family get ahead and tries to give them a better quality of life. \r\n\r\nDaniel wants to buy a pump in order to irrigate his crops more efficiently, since water for farming use is scarce in his area and people generally rely on wells for irrigation.

This shows in his business, which is a computer shop. At 32 and having graduated from college, Albert is doing well making his business grow. He currently lives with Judalyn and their son in Tanza, Cavite. \r\n\r\nAlbert makes it a point that people who have the same passion as he should have easy access to the Internet. Thus, every day he opens his shop for online users in his community, whose ages range from elementary students to middle class working professionals. His shop is located adjacent to his house so that he can manage it more efficiently.  Albert has been successful for four years now even without the aid of any employees. Monthly, he earns an estimated net income of Php 9,200.\r\n\r\nTo help him improve his business and continuously feed his passion, Albert solicits the help of CCT by applying for a loan worth Php 11,000. He intends to use this loan to purchase another computer for his shop. With this fund, he can also be equipped with ready money to purchase any necessary spare parts for his existing set of computers. According to him, this loan will definitely increase his profits and lead to the creation of an additional branch. \r\n\r\nCertainly there are times when trouble occurs, not just with his computers but also with his health. These are the struggles he currently faces. Nevertheless, Albert fights these struggles head on, knowing that his faith in the Lord and his undying passion will carry him through. It is his desire to have a healthy life and a strong family relationship. He also aims to have his own house as he strives to support his son all the way to college.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":778784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy a computer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":733.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":796.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195131},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":3666.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3981.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474139},{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":2933.32,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3184.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636920},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":2933.7,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005230},{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":733,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":795.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764407}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T02:04:26Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":306781,"name":"Lucia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucia Del Carmen tiene 49 a\u00f1os, su actividad es la compra y venta de calzado.

She lives in Church Center Bamenda, Northwest region in Cameroon. She is separated with 3 children. With the difficulties she had in the matrimonial home she was unable to cope with the situation. Her parents died when she was still young. Shetu Ndjrumbomenyi was unable to continue her education. Her last resort was to get married, which could provide a solution to her problem, but later turned out to be a negative. Since she separated from her husband, the husband has never supported her nor provided needs for the children so she is the sole person that provides for the basic needs for herself and the children. \r\n\r\nBefore joining GHAPE, she was roasting fish, but without capital. She usually borrows and sells before paying, which earns her little income. Given a new loan, Shetu Ndjrumbomenyi plans to continue her business and even expand. She has a good site with more customers who are ready to buy. The profit she will obtain from the loan will enable her to pay her children's school fees and also provide the family with basic needs. \r\n\r\nShetu Ndjrumbomenyi prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the interest rate and repayment modalities offered. It is better when compared to other financial houses found in her locality. This, along with the training GHAPE gives its clients before a loan is granted, has also encouraged her to join GHAPE.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

M. was born in the province of  Cabo Delgado in the north of Mozambique. He is 50 years old, married, and has 5 children who are 26, 24, 21, 20 and 7 years old. All of his children are currently in school. Avelino only studied through 6th grade under the old system of education, and didn't continue because at that time there was no chance for him to do so. He lives with his family in their own house and helps to support a niece who lives with them.\r\n\r\nHe left Cabo Delgado in 1975 to comply with the obligatory military service. Later he built a family in the Boane district, where he currently lives. He is retired from the Ministry of Defense and has a monthly pension of 6604 Meticais. He doesn\u2019t employ any household help. He uses the money from his pension for household expenses and also saves some in his bank account.  \r\n\r\nAvelino has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is his 6th loan, for the amount of 16,000 Meticais. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, iron, blocks, sand and other items) in order to continue working on a home improvement project. His earlier loans were for 6500, 8500, 12,500, 7050 and 15,500 Meticais and were all used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to finish his house, in order to offer his family better living conditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain,

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Evelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Evelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

A college graduate, she runs a small business selling women\u2019s clothing in the central city market in Kherson.

She has promptly repaid a total of seven loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d. Her attentiveness and creativity have helped her develop a good understanding of what her clients need and want. They always feel complimented when she goes out of her way to help them with their selections. This has naturally boosted Olga\u2019s sales and led to growth in her business.\r\n\r\nOlga is requesting a loan for $1,000 to enable her to significantly expand her business by purchasing a new vending facility. She is also planning to re-stock her existing kiosk and purchase a supply of inventory for her new vending location. Olga is hoping to reinvest generated income into further expansion of her business. She believes that consistent growth will help her provide a stable source of income and continue to secure her family\u2019s well-being.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u2013

Reina owns a tortilla shop, which is located in her own home.  She has been in this business for some time, due to the fact that she is a single mother and her mother has a serious illness.  This is why Reina must work very hard to continue progressing and trying to help her tortilla business grow, as it is the only source of income that she has.  Reina requested a loan from Integral with the hope of being able to improve her business conditions.  With this loan, she will purchase more corn and with purchasing it at wholesale price, it will be at a lower price.  This will be of great benefit to her, as it will help her meet higher demand and provide her with higher earnings.  This gives Reina a lot of hope, since she will have the necessary money to provide her mother with all of the medical treatments that she needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

elaborar las pupusas, ella se traslada en autob\u00fas durante 40 minutos a una ciudad del oriente de pa\u00eds para comprarlos, puesto que ah\u00ed los adquiere a mejor precio.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Alejandra esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo a Fundaci\u00f3n Campo para comprar ma\u00edz, fr\u00edjol y otros ingredientes que necesita para elaborar las pupusas. Adem\u00e1s, ella quiere reparar el lugar donde vende las pupusas ya que actualmente lo hace debajo de una ramada de hojas de pl\u00e1tano, ubicada al otro lado de la calle donde ella vive junto a sus hijos. A pesar de que cuando llueve se moja todo su negocio, el lugar es estrat\u00e9gico para su venta ya que por ah\u00ed pasan los autobuses y le compran las personas que viajan a otras ciudades.\n\nCon la ayuda del prestamo ella espera obtener mejores ingresos, para ella y sus hijos logrando tener una seguridad econ\u00f3mica para una vida mejor.\n\nEn un futuro, la se\u00f1ora Alejandra desea tener una crianza de cerdos y que sus hijos le ayuden para tener otra fuente de ingresos y asi seguir mejorando su condici\u00f3n de vida.\n","en":"Sra. Alejandra is 45 years old and a single mother with three children.  For the past seven years, she has been selling \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pupusa\" target=\"_blank\" >pupusas<\/a>\u201d (a traditional dish in El Salvador).  She learned this trade from her mother.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to acquire the supplies needed to make \u201cpupusas\u201d, Alejandra must travel 40 minutes by bus to a city in the eastern part of the country.  She buys her products in this area because the prices are better. \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Alejandra is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy corn, beans, and other ingredients needed to make \u201cpupusas\u201d.  In addition, she wants to make repairs to the place where she sells her product, which currently consists of an arbor made of banana leaves and is located on the other side of the street where she and her children live.  Even though her business gets soaked when it rains, the location is a strategic place for selling since buses pass through that area and people traveling from other cities buy her food.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith the help of this loan, Alejandra hopes to generate more income for herself and her children so that they will have financial security for a better life.  In the future, Sra. Alejandra wants to raise pigs and have her children help her so that they will have another source of income.  This will help them to continue improving their living conditions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":877508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corn, beans, and other ingredients.

He lives in a traditional family among other households in the district of Hamdallaye, in Segou. Mamadou holds a vocational training certificate as a customs officer, but due to a lack of employment opportunities, he opted to switch to a different career in order to enter the work force. He became an apprentice cameraman working with professionals at the Office for Radio and Television of Mali (ORTM). After several years of training, he branched out on his own to work as a cameraman. His main strength is in the quality of his services.\r\n\r\nIn order to be better equipped to meet customer demand, Mamadou is seeking his first loan from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso to purchase a camera, which he plans to buy in Ghana. He works for cash, and his clientele consists of both men and women. He expects that this loan will help him to earn a profit of 40,000FCFA per month. This will allow him to handle customer demand and make loan repayments to Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":991440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy a camera.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":13636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140114},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-25T08:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757080},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-18T08:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251841},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410839},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448992},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502747},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268428},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498841},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102892},{"amount":27.28,"local_amount":13636.36,"processed_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243170},{"amount":27.27,"local_amount":13636.4,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":13771.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624759}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T22:15:24Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":696747,"name":"Murodullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\nMurodullo was born in 1981 year.

She lives in a nuclear family in Sanankoroba, located 20 kilometers from Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali. She works as a teacher at the kindergarten of the children village SOS (VESOS) in Sanankoroba. To increase her income, she decided to join the loan credit of Kiva's partner Soro Yiriwaso. After three solidarity loans (group loans) that were repaid without problem, she's seeking her first personal loan. She intends to use it to buy 10 handbags, 10 pairs of shoes, and various other items at a market in Burkina Faso, where she goes get her supplies once a month.

She pays for transport costs for the products she buys in Mengo Kisenyi for her shop in Busega, on the outskirts of Kampala. On average she receives about 20 customers a day. She has been in this business for two years and with MCDT for four years, servicing her tenth loan and working with the same group mates.  Helen uses public transport to and from shopping. Her challenges include customer defaults and the ever increasing price of poultry and animal feed. Helen wants to use this loan to buy more bags of animal and chicken feed.

an active member of the Nuevo Porvenir (New Future) Community Bank, located in the parish of Cumbe, southwest of the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. This place is known for the fine craftwork that is woven there, and its original name is Cumbipirca, which comes the Quechua words meaning \"finely woven.\" Delfina is a 51-year-old single mother of five children, ages 30, 17, 14, and 12-year-old twins. Her eldest son is married and lives on his own. Her other children are still in school. None of the children know their father, and he also doesn't help them economically, so Delfina is in charge of providing for her family. They do not have their own home and live in a borrowed house where they only pay for basic services (electricity and water). Delfina sells roasted pork Tuesdays and Saturday in Cumbe's central plaza, and Wednesdays and Friday she sells coffee and empanadas at the livestock fair. She has 15 years' experience and tells us things are going well. Delfina says she joined the community bank a year ago, had to withdraw because of situations out of her control, and then returned. She is now in her second loan cycle, and with the loan she is requesting from Kiva partner Fundacion Espoir, she plans to use a portion to purchase pork, flour, lard, oil, etc. to make her meals, and to use the other part for her children's education. Her dream is to buy some land and build a home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

This work is profitable despite the pitfals inherent in all work, such as the theft of the animals.  Luz is looking to improve her livestock and she wants to have more animals.  This is her third loan request with MFP and her wish to continue forward in her communal bank and to increase her sales is big.  With the funding she will buy more cattle for her cowshed and she will start to improve her livestock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

The challenges she faces in business are unstable prices, especially for vegetables, the high cost of pesticides, a lack of proper spraying gear and fluctuating weather patterns, which affect her crop production. \r\n\r\nShe appreciates how far Juhudi has brought them and prays to manage her loan repayment well. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":587482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand her cereal business and vegetable farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-08-22T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":5833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.94,"local_amount":5835,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5915.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142450},{"amount":72.94,"local_amount":5835,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":5915.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437303},{"amount":72.94,"local_amount":5835,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5915.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576663},{"amount":159,"local_amount":12720,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":12894.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450210},{"amount":132.6,"local_amount":10608.31,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":10754.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030184},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":5833.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5913.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668248},{"amount":110.79,"local_amount":8863.36,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":8985.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446787},{"amount":72.94,"local_amount":5835,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5915.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535733},{"amount":72.94,"local_amount":5835,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":5915.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221857440},{"amount":35,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2838.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227073739}],"funded_date":"2010-08-23T05:27:11Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:39:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":228966,"name":"Parsinante Ole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Parsinante Ole P. is 27 years old.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":722816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her business is located at a busy area near a college known as Eregi in Kakamega. Kakamega is a rich agricultural land with sugarcane growing as the main farming activity. The region is in the western part of Kenya and is well known as the sugarbelt region. \r\n\r\nBeatrice sells fruits, vegetables, maize, beans and others to local people. She has been in this business for fifteen years now. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is financial constraints.
