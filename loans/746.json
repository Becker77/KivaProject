This will allow her to better meet the expectations of her ever-growing clientele.  The previous loan was properly repaid. \r\n\r\nShe foresees earning a monthly profit of 150,000 FCFA which will mostly be used to increase her working capital, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":965130,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fabric and spare parts for her sewing machines.

As a single mother, she has been working in the capital city for the past years to earn money and support her two children who are now in high school. She recently returned to her hometown and opened a small store on the property where she was born. Housed in a movable building, her store is the only one on that side of the village and offers drinks, snacks and necessities to nearby residents. She hopes eventually to expand her business to include a sauna and also to construct a home for her family on the same property. Her philosophy, however, is that careful planning is required and that her business will only grow in a stable fashion with gradual steps.

She's been raising chickens in a small shed in the rear of the house for two years. The business is going very well because she doesn't work alone: her husband also helps. This business is profitable because her chickens are ready to sell in less than 45 days and she sells them at a good price. She also has loyal customers. In the future, Carla would like to build another shed because the one she has only has room for 100 chickens, and she'd like to raise more. Her communal bank is called \"Trabajando juntos\" (\"Working Together\") and this is her seventh loan with MFP. She tells us that recently there have been some problems in her group, but she hopes they can be resolved quickly. Apart from that, she promises to be responsible in making her payments.

Her husband works as a delivery driver in order to help with the household expenses.  The couple has one dependent child.  Jacquelin\u2019s plan for her family includes providing a good education for her child as well as a decent home.  She has been working as a domestic employee for a year.  She easily tires from having to cook, clean, and iron for different people, but she does whatever it takes so that she can have a larger home in the future.  Jacquelin previously worked as a cashier and dispatcher at a grocery store before her employer went bankrupt because of low sales.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest challenge is not being able to purchase all of her construction materials at once because she does not make enough money and her husband\u2019s salary is used to cover their daily household necessities.  Jacquelin thanks AFODENIC for approving her second loan.  She will use the funds to purchase materials such as stone and cement.  Her first loan was used to buy enough materials to finish a room, but she would like to complete the construction of the entire house so that she can provide better security for her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":420767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T22:50:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaquelin Sugey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":890.09,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":920.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601742},{"amount":40.52,"local_amount":810.41,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:32Z","rounded_local_amount":838.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003187},{"amount":34.98,"local_amount":699.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":723.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841343},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874258},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604156},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:09Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639620},{"amount":56.4,"local_amount":1128.03,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1166.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821393},{"amount":23.6,"local_amount":471.97,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":488.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561409},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770371},{"amount":40,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":827.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204278}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T12:18:07Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":154161,"name":"Ngozi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngozi sells groceries and has been in the business for two years.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosita has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Rosita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosita has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: vegetable sales and fish vending. Her husband Rolly, 47 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children, 9 to 15 years old. Bebilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bebilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy more stock of vegetables and fertilizer so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Bebilyn M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF  :In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Therefore, Svay R. is requesting a loan to purchase pigs to fatten to add more profit.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":623152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase piglets to fatten","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Thom","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2010-10-22T18:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Svay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":318375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191576234},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195863985},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201561879},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206173803},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211247324},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-19T07:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216995126},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-18T07:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222109561},{"amount":25,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":106125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227063051}],"funded_date":"2010-10-22T23:42:35Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:29:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":244991,"name":"Carlos Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos Andres tiene 46 a\u00f1os, es casado, tiene un hijo, vive en la ciudad hermosa del Cusco, Per\u00fa y desde hace mucho tiempo que participa en el banco comunal \u201cPatr\u00f3n de San Sebasti\u00e1n\u201d de la Unidad de Micro finanzas Arariwa.

She is married and has five children, aged 19, 18, 16, 14 and 11. In 2000, she established her dairy business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supoorts her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase a young dairy cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sanam plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about ten liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women (Patan BPW). Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. It operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

On the other hand, what she does not like about her work is that some of her tenants leave the rooms in a bad state of repair.  In spite of this, Sheila has plans to expand her business and build, or fit out, a mini apartment which she plans to rent out at a higher price.\r\n\r\nThis will be Sheila's first loan from MFP and she hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goal.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time.  Sheila will invest the sum that she has requested in fixing up and painting the walls of her rental rooms.  She will also fix the drainage.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":921743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy paint and to fix the drainage in her rental rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-19T20:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sheila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":134.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":132},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":143.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":149.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":151.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":159.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.45,"local_amount":129.19,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":130.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622049},{"amount":50.25,"local_amount":134.01,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":135.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836143},{"amount":49.5,"local_amount":132,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":133.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245907},{"amount":53.97,"local_amount":143.93,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":145.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385936},{"amount":55.99,"local_amount":149.3,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":151.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099020},{"amount":56.96,"local_amount":151.9,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":153.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713168},{"amount":59.88,"local_amount":159.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:16Z","rounded_local_amount":161.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202090}],"funded_date":"2011-11-20T10:15:08Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":363860,"name":"Arlen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlen is 33 years old and lives in Goaw, Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.

This is all because she wants to achieve her dream of giving her children a good education. <br \/><br \/>Irine is a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpments. She has been farming for the past 10 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, maize, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Irine is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nandi Hills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Irine could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Irine, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Irine believes that this loan will be of much help and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Irine to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children. <br \/><br \/>Like Irine, many women smallholder farmers wait for your help.

She left school during Grade 9 to get married.  She started making meatpies with her sister-in-law.  Her apprenticeship lasted only four days.  Since then she has been in high demand from services and NGOs (Non-Governmental Agencies) when they hold workshops and colloquiums.  She has many clients as she is well-known in her neighborhood.  In the evenings, she has many customers where she sells.\r\n\r\nTo make the meatpies, she uses the following:  3 kilograms of wheat flour; 1\/2 kilogram of ground meat, 30 eggs, butter, and 4 bowls of water.  Once everything is mixed to a paste, she places and cuts the wheat-flour paste in which the ground meat is embedded.  Once they are cooked, the meatpies can be eaten.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her ever-increasing clientele, she is turning to the microfinancial institution Soro Yiriwaso.  She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 30 months.  She has three previous group loans and one previous individual loan, which have all been repaid.  This will be her second individual loan.\r\n\r\nShe will buy 50 kilograms of wheat flour, 3 drums of oil, 15 flats of eggs and meat on a daily basis.  She buys her ingredients locally at the main market in  S\u00e9gou.  Binta Soutoura sells for cash and on credit, both to men and women.\r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 45,000 FCFA with this loan, which will allow her to contribute to some of the family's expenses.  Her goal is to have a house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva

He keeps the larger bulls to lease out for plowing and, this way, generate the necessary income for his family.  Dedicating himself to livestock has been more beneficial than farming, given that earnings are generated more frequently and there is less risk of loss.  For the future, William plans to have a well-outfitted stable where he can house a greater number of animals.  This is his first loan through MFP.  He is very enthusiastic about working with his cooperative bank where, as a new member, he promises to be very active and work towards the common good of the members.

She lives with her husband in a nuclear family in the 3rd district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  She did not attend a modern school due to societal reasons.  She instead attended a Koranic school, but she dropped out after having mastered a few <i>suras<\/i> for praying.  \r\n\r\nWith the aim of participating in the economy, Adam started with several revenue-generating businesses along side her older sister, who used to be a major shopkeeper of S\u00e9gou.  Rich with these years of experience, she eventually advanced on her own, continuing in the same business as her sister for the past twenty years.  She enjoys a large customer base and recognition.  Her sales capacity is due to the quality of her merchandise and her affordable prices.  \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital, in order to make more profit, she turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  She has had an association with it for 42 months.  After three solidarity loans and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.  She intends to use this new loan to buy 20 men's outfits (suits with pants) in Burkina Faso.  She accepts cash or credit from customers composed of women and men.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions making a monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA.  This profit will enable her to fatten cattle and sheep.

She also has 7 tricycles for rent as an additional business. She lives in Barangay Punta Tagda, Zone 5 Hinigaran, Negros Occidental with her husband and their 2 children. The children are 9 and 15 years old and are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and tricycle rental business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP35,000.\r\n\r\nAmelia is now borrowing PHP40,000 so that she can use the additional capital for her general store and to purchase an additional tricycle. This will be her 16th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Amelia aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives with his family and 6 siblings. He is a relatively new business owner - he started working as a flooring worker almost three years ago.  His story illustrates the day-to-day challenges many people are facing in trying to help their families with their business income. Despite his situation, he feels positive about his business potential for the coming year because during those three years, he has been able to build a good business reputation. He is requesting to borrow $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy tools for a project renovating a small building. And he will also purchase a small car to facilitate his transportation to the projects he works on. In the future, he looks forward to taking on bigger projects in his community. \r\n \r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

He also wishes to prepare his children and see them achieve a university level career. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":603616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers to plant corn and beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito, San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-09-20T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209670}],"funded_date":"2010-09-20T17:15:33Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":236803,"name":"Candida Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"C\u00e1ndida es una mujer esforzada, dedicada al comercio, desde hace varios a\u00f1os, iniciando con dinero prestado.

In the future, Thikaymai plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

As any good man living in the country he is dedicated to farming, which is his main source of income, like many in the area.  For three years he has been working the land and obtained many things, among which is his own 3-acre patch of land on which he grows coffee and bananas.  Everyday he works from the early morning hours taking care of his crops because he knows the money he gets for his produce will depend on harvest quality.  He sells his crops in the La Merced market which is where he gets the most money.  During coffee season he sells his product to a co-op in the Sanchirio del Palomar community.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his work is harvest time, when he can reap the fruits of his months of hard work.  He also works as a farm laborer on other farms, where they pay him extra for the care he gives to crops.  In the future he hopes to be able to save enough money to buy a house.

He is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his parents and siblings as a primary source of income. The living conditions in the Endebes, Kitale area are very tough and one needs to have tough skin in order to survive. Paul has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. \n\nBecause of the hardcore poverty in his village, Paul started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 3 years. Paul's sources of income are from producing vegetables, maize, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, which is a problem for Paul. The Endebes area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. \n\nPaul with great humility is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Paul is very determined to succeed, and because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans to accumulate profits to provide a secure future for himself and for his parents and siblings. Paul's dream is to provide a secure future for his siblings. Through your loan you will help him realize his dream.\n\nPaul promises to make his payments punctually and is thankful to all those who will support him in acquiring the motorbike, all he can tell them is \"Thank You\".\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2038443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike, for the speedy transportation of his farm produce to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1759.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1811.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1864.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1918.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1974.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2032.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2091.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2153},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2215.92},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2280.68},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2347.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.93},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2486.54},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2559.21},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2634},{"due_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2710.98},{"due_date":"2017-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2790.21},{"due_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2871.75},{"due_date":"2017-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2955.68},{"due_date":"2017-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3042.06},{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3130.96},{"due_date":"2017-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3222.46},{"due_date":"2017-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3316.68},{"due_date":"2017-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3413.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.64},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.92},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.16},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.81},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.47},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.16},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.34},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.11},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.72},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.31},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.22},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.17},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2439,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p> Pedro sells one of the most popular foods in Ecuador, crab (<i>cangrejo<\/i> in Spanish). The crabs he sells, which are in the picture, are found in mangroves along the coast of Guayaquil. His father taught him how to catch these animals when he was 9 years old and he has been doing so ever since. Due to the unfortunate and strenuous economic situation his parents faced, Pedro did not go to school past the third grade. He cannot read and write, but out of the necessities of his job he has become good at math. Pedro no longer catches the animals himself to sell, instead he purchases them from wholesale distributors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> He needs the loan in order to purchase larger quantities of crab. The holiday season is a great time to sell because people have dinners known as \u201ccangrejadas\u201d where family and friends sit around a large table and break open crabs while talking and listening to music.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> This business plays a major role in the life of Pedro. He has 5 children, although two of them are already independent. His two grown children work with Pedro and also lack a formal education. Pedro hopes that with the extra profits from this business he will be able to fix up his home. Currently it is made out of a bamboo like wood and is situated near the coast where the tide often brings in water to his house.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

Jes\u00fas is a small community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project. The bank provides credit and educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations because it's a cold and very mountainous area (with altituD. ranges from 6,000-17,000 feet above sea level), it's difficult to grow crops there, and it lacks an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>BCR Coraz\u00f3n D. Jes\u00fas is located the community of Soccos in the Anco district of Churcampa province. The population's main activities are growing either corn (lower altitudes) or potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes), and raising guinea-pigs, pigs, and chicken. Soccos faces many difficulties due to its remoteness, lack of public transportation, and access to markets, and receives very few public and social services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bank has completed its first loan cycle in just half a year of existence. A total of 3,600 soles (about $1,240.00) has been loaned to nine women. The loans range from 100, 200, 400, and 600 soles and, in one case, 1,000 soles. The group was also able to save over 1,700 soles (about $590.00) in this first cycle and will continue to save in the future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During their first cycle, the members have learned to love and value themselves as people. They have learned\u2013sometimes for the first time in their lives\u2013to save, and have received some training about how to improve the quality of their lives. Most members have small grocery stores or sell at local weekly markets, but every member has a different testimony.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dora Z. D. C. runs a small grocery store and also sells ice-cream. With her loan of 600 soles, she will buy new supplies for the store. When asked about her future, she says that she wants to improve her small store and that everything she earns and saves is for the education of her children so they can keep studying and become professionals. She is saving to buy a glass showcase for her products and more items to sell.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mar\u00eda Soledad Q. M. buys and sells fruit at small, local weekly markets. She also has a small field where she produces pacay, oranges, and lime-fruits. And, if it's not enough, she buys and sells tara and cochinilla, which she takes to the markets as well. With her loan of 600 soles she will be able to buy more fruit to sell. With her savings she wants to improve her business, send her children to school, and make improvements to her house.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucia S. S. has the smallest loan of the group (100 soles) and runs a small business buying and selling animals like pigs. Sometimes she sells the meat of cows or bulls in Soccos or one of the local fairs. She also has some terrain where she cultivates corn, potatoes, wheat, barley, and olluco. But most of the production is for auto-consumption. Lucia\u2019s dream for the future is to buy a bull (improved) to use to raise cows. And, like all the women, her dream is for her family--to improve their quality of life and for her children to go to school. She will use her savings to buy school supplies because a new year is starting. Lucia says she has also learned some specific things in FINCA. She learned to say sorry and not fight over small issues, she learned not to gossip, not talk badly of someone, and to be more calm when talking with her husband and children.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":136216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy new supllies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-09T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Dorita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mecatla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Leonarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-24T21:57:39Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":209,"local_amount":601.92,"processed_date":"2008-04-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":604.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":190822},{"amount":209,"local_amount":601.92,"processed_date":"2008-05-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":604.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":218340},{"amount":209,"local_amount":601.92,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":604.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247299},{"amount":209,"local_amount":601.92,"processed_date":"2008-07-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":604.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275918},{"amount":209,"local_amount":601.92,"processed_date":"2008-08-24T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":604.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":305457},{"amount":205,"local_amount":590.4,"processed_date":"2008-09-24T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-07T07:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":592.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":336462}],"funded_date":"2008-03-10T21:57:39Z","paid_date":"2008-10-07T07:07:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":43400,"name":"Oluwakemi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oluwakemi A. is a typical businesswoman.

T. is a 70 years-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitele-K Fou.  She is widowed and has 7 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Katarina owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a bakery.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from baking & selling a variety of baked goods in the local community.  Katarina has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately $350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Katarina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Katarina has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase baking equipment.  Katarina is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional cooking ingredients.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Katarina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cuidar sus cultivos, lleva 8 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos hasta Tarma, ya que los sacos que lleva son muy pesados y la cansan mucho. En adelante, desea comprar nuevas tierras para incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Este es el quinto cr\u00e9dito con MFP y espera ser muy puntual en sus cuotas, puesto que no quiere darle problemas a su banco comunal, en el cual se siente muy contenta. Con los tres mil nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s abono para mejorar sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"Jovita, 25, is a young, very unassuming, hard working mother.

They have three children who are between 8 and 25 years old. \n\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,700, uplifting the family's standard of living. \n\nThis time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

Suyono has a food stall business that sells meatballs, chicken soup called \u201csoto\u201d and \u201cgado-gado\u201d (a kind of salad eaten with peanut sauce). This business was inherited from his father. It has been running for 11 years. Suyono is married to Desi and blessed with a daughter: Putri, who is 8 years old and in the second grade of elementary school.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for Suyono in running the food stall business is the increasing price of meat in the market. With the capital that he currently has, the quantity of meat that he is able to buy is lower. In order to generate more income, Suyono is thinking to improve his business by selling fruit ice, but unfortunately Suyono does not have enough capital to do so. \r\n\r\nHe learned that TLM would like to help entrepreneurs like him.  He is applying for a loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM to purchase a refrigerator to store the fruit, a blender and some wood to create a small table. Suyono hopes TLM will approve his loan application to improve his business.

This is 27-year-old Haika C. from Mbeya. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 3 and 9. Haika has been running a business selling phone accessories since 2005.<p>\r\n\r\nDespite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country (forgive the label, there remains no consensus on an acceptable definition), it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general. Not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids, street sellers. It can probably be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people because there are few landlines, and followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Haika currently earns about $60 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $475 USD in order to increase stock of phone accessories. In the future, she plans to increase phone accessories and varieties of phones in her business.

She lives with her two children, who are ages 10 and 4 and who study at the elementary school, and her mother who is 70 years old. Reina works making and selling tortillas, which she sells Monday through Sunday, more around midday than in the afternoons. Her mother helps her so she is able to work more efficiently in order for her to be able to help the many customers who fill her business, especially during peak hours. This business has been a great help for Reina and her whole family. She is requesting this loan in order to buy a larger quantity of corn and, also, to buy cans of propane gas to be able to keep some in storage for occasions during the year when gas is running short which can be detrimental for her business.

This business, although it has not produced many profits because of nearby supermarkets and street markets, has enabled her to live, covering her basic necessities (food and bills).  She lives with her husband.  With this loan, she will purchase merchandise, since, due to the recent earthquake of February 27 of this year, Mercedes lost 90% of her merchandise because of a small collapse of one wall in her house.  She suffers constant pain in one of her legs because of varicose veins, but she has been able to keep herself going by keeping up with her business, including her dream to have a small bakery.  Loans have very much helped Mercedes to get ahead in her business.  She also very much enjoys the relationships among her fellow group members, the good treatment from her consultant, and classes about how to correctly help clients.  \r\n<br>\r\nLinares is an important urban center in the Maule region, located in the central region of the country.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating \"tricycle\" (three-wheeled) transport services. Benedicta is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Benedicta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benedicta is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This will be the first loan taken out by Benedicta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Each day she rises very early to prepare the stuffed potatoes, which leaves her little time to attend to her children as the preparation is more work over time.  Since she kept having more children and it become difficult to care for them and work, her husband found a job in construction and she decided to change and sell \"salchi-papas\" (a fried sausage and potatoe snack) which she sells from Monday to Friday from 5pm until 9:30pm and Saturdays she works cleaning houses, while attending to her children in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWith FINCA Carolina's business has changed and she has learned to save.  She buys ingredients wholesale so that she can earn more.  She does not like to pay if other members lack resources, but she knows the rules of the village bank.  She needs an 800 soles loan to buy oil and potatoes as ingredients for the preparation of the salchi-papas.\r\n\r\nCarolina dreams of finishing the construction of her home and putting in a small grocery store.  She has made a goal to achieve this in two years and with the help of her family and hard work, hopes to do so.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kahn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":257068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of oil and potatoes as indgredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T03:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":217.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397259},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":217.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088963},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":435.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982299}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T05:12:14Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:12:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kahn","image":986682}},{"id":88511,"name":"Tith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Tith K. lives in the Thlos village in Takeo province.

With this loan, they would like to buy raw materials, such as brightly colored fabrics, buttons, zippers, thread, embroidering materials, yarn, etc. to make a variety of pretty dresses, which they hope to sell more of this Christmas. \r\n\r\nThey would like to thank the institution for the support it has provided with this loan, which has benefited their workshop greatly, helping it grow in sales and become a bigger attraction to new clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":449433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buying raw materials to make dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T22:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.24,"local_amount":1024.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003335},{"amount":49.96,"local_amount":999.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841502},{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":1015.84,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1056.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874424},{"amount":49.91,"local_amount":998.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604303},{"amount":51.2,"local_amount":1024.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639767},{"amount":46.9,"local_amount":937.8,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":974.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821551},{"amount":53.73,"local_amount":1074.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1117.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561559},{"amount":46.27,"local_amount":925.46,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":962.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770495}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T00:35:03Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":166620,"name":"Sakina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina is thirty-nine years old.

Her husband is a pensioner and her elder son is currently a guest worker in Russia, usually sending about 250 dollars monthly.\r\n\r\nMisirat\u2019s family deals in livestock. They have three milk cows, one horse and a few sheep and also produce milk and milk products such as yogurt, sour cream and kefir (a fermented milk drink). For this loan she is planning to buy a milk cow. In the future she hopes to increase the number of her milk cows and produce enough milk to have supply agreements with kindergartens.\r\n\r\nMahpuba, 51, is married and has four children: three daughters and one son. Her elder two daughters are working in Russia as salespersons and her husband works in a tobacco plant as crew chief. She is asking for the loan to buy a milk cow. \r\n\r\nJanysh is the youngest member of this group. He is just 26 years old and is married with one little daughter. His wife is a member of a farming collective. Janysh lives with his parents, but he hopes in near future to buy proper land and build his own house.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a 10,000 Philippine peso loan.

Hanadi's husband, Ahmed, runs an electronics accessories store selling items such as batteries, electric machines cords, etc. Hanadi's husband needs to improve the store, adding shelves and showing windows as well as purchasing more goods to sell and increase his returns.\n\nHanadi is a housewife and helps her husband by working in the store. The store serves a good number of clients, and selling more goods will be helpful to improve it and have better income.\n\nHanadi's husband appears here in the picture as Hanadi is not comfortable having her picture online since she comes from a conservative background.\n\nImportant information about this loan:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit our FAQs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":633412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

It is the fourth time that this group has requested financial aid from Alid\u00e9 so that they can increase their business volume. Alphonsine is 60 years old and married to an accountant called Godens. The couple has three children, all educated, one of whom remains a dependent. Alphonsine lives with her husband and dependent child. She covers the various family expenses together with her husband. She did not attend school and now has an activity selling various groceries (corn, bread) as well as clothing, in her neighborhood; this allows her to provide for her family's needs, as well as her own, without any difficulty. Alphonsine has been carrying out this business for the past seven years. She gets her supplies in Benin. With a view to responding better to customer demand, she would like to increase her stock. In order to do this, Alphonsine is requesting a fourth loan from Alid\u00e9 together with the other members of the Alodononzo group. The first three loans have all been fully repaid.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.
