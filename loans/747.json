She is married to Gabriel P., an electrician, and is the mother of three children, two of whom are already working and settled down with their own families while the youngest will graduate from high school at the end of the school year. By the grace of God, Eleuteria has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. A dream for most Filipino parents like Eleuteria as she herself was once a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nEleuteria operates a canteen and a small variety store and oversees the operations of a gown-for-rent business. In the Philippines, the whole working community and majority of families only eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal way of living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nEleuteria dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":625014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings.

She began her business a year ago. She learned in a course from the municipality that she took nearby. She began with a few things with her savings from selling tlacoyos (a Mexican snack). Every day she went out to sell her tlacoyos of fava beans, cheese curds, and kidney beans in the center of the community where she lives. Her business is important because she likes what she does and it generates income for her. She feels proud when she dyes hair, curls it, or does hairdos and the customer likes the result. Her clients are relatives, friends, and neighbors from the community. She is planning to expand her business and to buy all the supplies, furniture and materials necessary for her work, to give her customers better comfort and the services that they request. She thinks she will succeed by making an effort and saving, and with the loan she is going to stock up on all the materials.

She is an experienced farmer because she has been engaged in farming for 26 years.  She typically earns in the neighborhood of $4.00 per day through her effort.

from Tanzania! Asiah is a 40-year-old married woman with two children (ages nine and 16). She and her husband are also responsible for two more children under the age of 18 who are orphans related to the family. Asiah has two businesses: a photocopy shop and a beauty salon. She established the salon seven months ago and is already earning $US400 from the profits at the salon. Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. \r\n<p>Asiah is requesting a loan of $US275 to purchase necessary items such as hair products, wigs, and cosmetics for her salon. She hopes to pay back this loan in six months.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional beauty salon inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T01:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asiah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T16:16:30Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":344467},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347923},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970497},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886714},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435974}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T16:16:30Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64733,"name":"Aida Camara","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"AIDA CAMARA S.

She is married to Mr. Fedelito C. and is blessed with two children; a girl of 6 years old in kindergarten 2 and a boy of 3 years old in kindergarten 1. \r\n\r\n\tEarly in 1990, she decided to go to Manila to find a job.  In 1994, she decided to resign from her job and started to establish a sari-sari store out of her savings.  She got married in 1997 to Mr. Fedelito C., a construction worker.  Early 2008, the couple decided to go to Ozamiz city due to the economic situation in Manila. Upon her arrival in Ozamiz City, her elder brother gave her a small amount of initial capital for her business to support her family.  The sister of her husband also gave the opportunity to her husband to drive their motor cab to generate income for the household.  She started up a sari-sari store in her residence with the money given to her by her brother.  She buys grocery items and also engages in E-Load business.\r\n\r\n\tWhen she heard that Paglaum MPC was expanding its membership in their barangay, she decided to join in order to have additional capital for her sari-sari store and also to be able to have savings deposit and insurances for her family.  She produced her 1st cycle in Paglaum MPC last July 2008 in the amount of P 7,000.00 as additional capital for her business and also engage in food vending to be sold in her neighbors.  A portion of the proceeds was used in the repacking chlorine and tawas to be delivered to the public market and to different grocery stores in the city.  Unfortunately, an emergency befell her family; that\u2019s why she defaulted in her weekly payment.  However, despite of what happened she will find other sources and able to recover all her losses.  \u201cThat was a lesson to learn, if I have enough savings maybe my capital shall not be diverted to use for emergencies.\u201d she said.  Now she availed her 2nd loan in the amount of P 4,000.00 for additional capital of her existing business. \r\n\r\n\t  She\u2019s hoping that that someday she will able to expand her business, especially for repacking chlorine and tawas for the whole province in Misamis Occidental, but also in the nearby provinces.  She dreams that in time her daughter will become a nurse and her son will become a policeman.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":259818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Some of the teachers will invest in businesses in order to supplement their monthly salaries. Some of them will use their loan to buy furniture, like a bed or chairs, while others will use it to pay school fees either for themselves or for their children. \r\n\r\nAlfred B. C. (fifth from right) has been a teacher for over thirty-one years and is now the headmaster of RC Teko (Lower). Alfred was born in Yoni, a small town in the Tonkolili district of northern Sierra Leone. He is fifty-seven years old, married and has eight children. Three of his children are already grown-ups and three are still attending school. Mr. C. will use his loan to buy house building materials such as corrugated iron roofing, nails, sand and cement.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":293467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Ayda started this business because she does not have a university level education and has only completed studies up to 6th grade. \r\n<p>\r\nIn spite of not having the opportunity to complete her schooling she refused to stop fighting to advance in life. She is the mother of two. As a result, she began selling plates of food like gallo pinto (combined rice and beans), tajadas (fried plantain slices), empanadas (pastries filled with meat, chicken, etc), tacos and enchiladas. Over time her customer base increased and so did her variety of menu items. \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason she is requesting financing in order to buy grains, fruits and other supplies.

She is the coordinator for her group, La Solucion (The Solution), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nAyde and her husband live with their two children in Samana, a small town in the northeastern region of the Dominican Republic. Life in the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Ayde runs a successful mobile clothing business. With this loan, she plans to purchase new shirts and undergarments to sell to her friends and the women in her community.\r\n\r\nThis is Ayde\u2019s second loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve her home life for her family. She hopes to purchase a radio and new dishes for her home, as well as new school supplies for her children. Ayde\u2019s profits also have allowed her to have fun activities with her family, such as ordering pizzas or going out for ice cream. In the past, these types of activities would not have been possible.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: cosmetics sales, fish vending and buying and selling livestock. Her husband Daniel S. Jr. is 53 years old and works as a fish vendor to earn his living.  He also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have four children between the ages of 8 and 19.  \r\n\r\nWilme joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Wilme has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to purchase cosmetic products and fish to sell so that she could continue to save up for her children's future education. \r\n\r\nWilme S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking on the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She is wearing a beige jacket and has short, wavy hair.   \r\n\r\nShe has been working as an artisan for 30 years, specifically in wood carving and woolen fabrics and knits.  She usually buys her materials at a market in the city of Cauquenes.  There she buys wool, wood and tools.  She says that she has a large number of customers that she knows.  She makes her sales during the year from her house, but during the summer season she sets up and sells her products at a craft fair located in a municipal gymnasium. \r\n\r\nWith the loan she will buy wool for her knits and fabrics.  Her goal is to have an established local for her business in a tourist area where she can offer and sell her crafts year-round. \r\n\r\nMiriam lives with her husband and three children, ages 22, 20 and 7.  Her older children work in a dependent manner.  She would have liked to have studied for a career in business administration, but she says that now it is too complicated as she has to work.  She is motivated to continue working at her business as her income helps her family and will allow her to give her children a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the services that Fondo Esperanza has given her, especially the loan, since it has helped her to invest in her business.

They live in Monterrico in the district of Sivia. Alberto is a great man, very talented when it comes to farmwork as at the age of 14 he already had a small coffee-growing area where he spent his time with the final objective of obtaining the fruits and subsequently selling them and in this way obtaining an income with which to cover his food costs and some of his education expenses. Over the years Alberto continued with his farmwork setting aside his studies for a lack of economic resources. Thus the only option he had was to work his plot of land, continue growing coffee and, thanks to his parents' instruction, currently produce a large amount of coffee beans. Generally he works alone but at harvest time he always needs the help of manual labourers.\r\n\r\nAlberto is grateful and happy for now being a good farmer as thanks to this he is managing to achieve economic stability which means that he and his 4 children can have a dignified life. This will be his first loan with MFP and he agrees to make the repayments on time.\r\n\r\nAlberto is grateful to the members of his communal bank for developing a good working relationship together.

She cares for them lovingly and together with her husband Claudio, aged 50, they want to prosper and improve their income in order to pay for higher education for their children.  In their small suburb of Villa el Salvador, Paulina has a butcher shop which supplies all her neighbours; it is very busy and she usually sells all the meat she has in stock.  She has had this business for 10 years with which she has been able to feed her children and pay for their schooling, but she feels that it will not be sufficient to pay for their higher education and therefore she wants to open a butcher shop in downtown Juliaca, where she could sell to many more people.  She enjoys talking with her clients, but it is very difficult to bring the meat all the way to her neighbourhood which is very far from the city, but at the same time her eagerness to prosper does not wane and she is prepared to work very hard to reach her goals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The official name of this borrowing group is Wisma Cempaka 1 (MUK-0018).\r\n\r\nDewa Mas is married and has four school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community.

In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*****************************************************<\/b>\r\nDewa Mas Ayu M.

Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":523389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dewa Mas Ayu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10147545,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189219}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T02:06:27Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":196711,"name":"Esther Luzmila","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cliente recurrente que viene cancelando en forma puntual su credito, solicita una ampliacion del mismo para gastos persoanles, cliente que no cuenta con deuda alguna, esta firmando con su madre quien tambien fue clienta  de la CRAC, se propone el credito por contar con buen comportamiento crediticio.","en":"This is a previous client who repaid her loan punctually.

Pedrita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Pedrita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pedrita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Pedrita is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Pedrita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

This helps to sustain daily needs and enhance her entrepreneurial ability allowing her to earn PHP 3,500 (Philippine pesos) a month. In 2006, Librada joined GDMPC to ease the difficulty of financing for business subsistence and expansion. \r\n\r\nThe cooperative allowed her a loan of PHP 10,000 to obtain grocery products to sell.

The loan will be used to purchase more motor oil and tires, and it will help William to generate greater profits and complete the construction of his house. William hopes that in the future he will be able to buy a new, popular kind of motorcycle. \r\n\r\nWilliam is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP). The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like William who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":914644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more motor oil and tires.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Masindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T15:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":155134},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":160287},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":165611},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":171112},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":176796},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171060}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.24},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.05,"local_amount":155134,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":160098.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244524407},{"amount":64.12,"local_amount":160287,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":165416.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250733127},{"amount":66.24,"local_amount":165611,"processed_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T08:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":170910.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257687781},{"amount":68.45,"local_amount":171112,"processed_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-20T07:34:03Z","rounded_local_amount":176587.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264132812},{"amount":66.47,"local_amount":166171,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T07:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":171488.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270211249},{"amount":72.67,"local_amount":181685,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":187499.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277951264}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T12:11:52Z","paid_date":"2012-05-22T08:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":360656,"name":"Magdalina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalina is a 44-year-old married woman with 4 children who is separated from her husband.

Barang yang dijual pun beraneka macam seperti makanan ringan dan kebutuhan pokok setiap hari bahkan sayur mayur.Setiap hari Ni Ketut Suarni membuka warung pada pukul 07.00 wita dan tutup pada pukul 18.00 wita. Karena warung ada didepan rumahnya, maka jika tidak ada pelanggan yang berbelanja Ni Ketut Suarni bisa melakukan pekerjaan rumah tangga lainnya. Dalam menjalankan usaha ini Ni Ketut Suarni membutuhkan  dana untuk menambah usaha warungnya karena pelanggannya banyak sedangkan modal yang dimiliki sangat terbatas. Disamping melayani konsumen secara individu untuk kepentingan sendiri, Ni Ketut Suarni juga menjadi suplyer bagi para pedagang yang lain yang lebih kecil karena modal yang mereka miliki sangat kecil dan terbatas. Sekarang setelah Ni Ketut Suarni mendapat tambahan modal ia dapat melayani para konsumen lebih banyak lagi dengan keuntungan bersih perhari  mencapai Rp.150.000,- yang dulunya hanya memperoleh keuntungan bersih perhari Rp 50.000. Usaha warung ini ditekuninya dengan harapan  kedepannya usaha warung dapat lebih meningkat dan menjadi lebih besar lagi dari sekarang."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":83611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To add the inventory for her small shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-11-16T14:45:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suarni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-30T16:56:54Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T02:28:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94404},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T06:40:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111493},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T07:20:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129071},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T07:31:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154076},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T06:25:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182691},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T03:01:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213687},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T07:05:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246065},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-07-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278514},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308013},{"amount":30,"local_amount":257142.86,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-30T07:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":273772.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339150},{"amount":50,"local_amount":428571.4,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":456288.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308113}],"funded_date":"2007-11-16T16:56:54Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T02:27:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":27892,"name":"Im","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Im S., age 55, is a widow and works selling porridge, earning around $1 each day.

Unlike many of her peers she always knew exactly what she wants to do in life. When she chose her profession Sypaada was not driven by prestige or the demand of the profession, but rather by what she had a real aptitude for and what gave her gratification. She became a hairdresser.\r\n\r\nWhen she was seventeen Sypaada finished a school of image making and hairdressing. Two years of working with experienced specialists in the country's capital helped her when she moved back to her home town of Toktogul to share her skills with her colleagues. Daily long hour shifts have increased her clientele base. Thus the monthly income for Sypaada is now 10000 soms. With more services offered in her salon there are more expenses. Most expenses include equipment, instruments and supplies. Sypaada plans to spend this loan mainly on buying additional instruments for the salon. Her biggest dream is to open her own beauty salon with highest quality service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":733251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for the hairdressing salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sypaada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0414\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4248},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4535},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4677},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4837},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5111},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5320},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5506},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5766}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.37},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":4248,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192752},{"amount":96.37,"local_amount":4535,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4573.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571556},{"amount":663.36,"local_amount":31217,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":31480.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546216}],"funded_date":"2011-03-18T02:49:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":286876,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 40-year-old single woman living with one parent and two siblings.

Before the first sun\u2019s rays appear she leaves her house and walks nearly an hour to reach her fields where she has cocoa beans, coffee and hardwood trees planted - products that she subsequently takes to various gathering sites.  \r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is cultivating her fields because she feels she\u2019s putting them to good use.  She\u2019s been in this activity for 10 years and considers the most difficult part having to transport her products because the sacks she carries are very heavy and they tire her out quite a bit.

P. is a single, 61 years old woman.  She has no children, just one nephew in her care that is 17 years old and in his 4th year of secondary school.  Alba doesn't have a partner in life. Her  purpose is to keep her business active so that it continues to earn her income in spite of the increase in the cost of gas, now that she has to go through the streets looking for passengers.  Alba hopes to acquire another vehicle so that her nephew can manage it and get experience in this type of business. That way, he'll have another means of work so he can help himself in the days to come. She hopes that the quality of life in her country will improve, given that the help of other donor countries is so important, since it supports the people that really need it.\r\n\r\nHer main economic activity is providing taxi services, and it is located throughout the city. She has four years of experience at her work. Alba started this business as an alternative way of earning money. She got the taxi service by selling a business selling whole grains that she had in the wholesale market of Bisne in Managua and through other necessary financing arrangements.  Alba didn't have a lot of knowledge about this type of business at first, so the person she hired as the driver turned in very little money and didn't distribute the earnings.  With the help of her family, she managed to find a reliable person for this job. Over time, she has gained experience in the business, but she still needs the requested financing to fund the business so that she can make improvements to her vehicle, including changing the radiator, tires, and other things.  She acknowledges the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and its sister organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":259891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repairs to her vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-22T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399998},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091996},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985379},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445995},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956636},{"amount":286.36,"local_amount":5400,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-18T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5647.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174062}],"funded_date":"2009-01-22T18:16:14Z","paid_date":"2009-08-18T09:06:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":89371,"name":"Lim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan group is made up of four members, all residents of Chong Kneas Commune, Siem Reap Province.

Maureen enjoys her work and is dedicated to helping non-profit organizations use media to effectively disseminate their message. \r\n\r\nShe heard the same response from many banks, which was that they couldn\u2019t lend to a business of her size at this time. Given that she needed capital to sustain and to help grow her business, Maureen decided to look into microfinance options and so she came to ACCION USA. With her loan, Maureen is hiring a new employee to help grow the business\u2019 client base. She will also use a portion of the loan to cover the costs associated with developing new partnerships with other media companies to initiate new projects. \r\n\r\nMaureen has established her business and created a loyal clientele that depends on her for their media needs.

The group is located in the city of Cuenca, where they can enjoy the natural beauty of the city where the surrounding mountain range and plentiful vegetation forge a unique landscape. The locals make a living in agriculture, livestock and also making hand-woven sombreros.\r\n\r\nRosa is 40 years old and has been separated from her husband for seven years, after he left to work on the Ecuadorian coast and found someone else. She had eight children from her marriage, one of whom is married and independent, two who work in the city at a construction office and help with expenses, one who is out of school but helps with the house, and the other four are still young and in school. She owns her home, which is small and made of adobe but still provides security. She makes a living in agricultural, cultivating the land and occasionally hiring workers. She also raises animal and has a cow, a sheep and chickens, which she sells only when she's in some economic trouble. This is her second loan cycle working with her community bank, and with the money she plans to purchase a pig to raise, fatten and sell. Her dream is to better herself more everyday, increase her number of livestock and fix her house up little by little.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda C. lives in Taguan in the Sigsig area, which is located only 7 kilometers from Castillo De Chobshi, which is a popular architectural structure. She is 56 years old, married and has eight children. One of her daughters committed suicide, orphaning her two children, who are now under Mar\u00eda's care and going to the community school. Five of Mar\u00eda's children live in the city of Cuenca and the others left in search of better opportunities and almost never come to visit. For now, she only lives with her 14-year-old son, who helps around the house, her two grandchildren and her husband, who is a construction worker in the city center and only comes home on weekends. They have a small home that they own. Mar\u00eda raises animals such as pigs, chickens, guinea pigs and cattle, and only sells them during times of economic trouble. She also makes a living harvesting vegetables and selling them in the city of Cuenca. This is her second loan cycle with the community bank, and with the first one she purchased chicken that are now ready to sell, and with the new loan she plans to purchase pigs to fatten and then sell. Her dream is to be able to have more cows so she can sell their milk and make cheeses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":513516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase animals to raise and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"  Nancy Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Hilda Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Rosa Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosa Claudina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Marianita De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2860,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":238.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":666.48,"local_amount":663,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":666.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674821},{"amount":291.84,"local_amount":290.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":291.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709000},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":238.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":239.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709001},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":238.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":239.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892297},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":238.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":239.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892298},{"amount":479.16,"local_amount":476.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":479.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632673},{"amount":479.16,"local_amount":476.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":479.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846731},{"amount":239.62,"local_amount":238.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":239.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113251}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T02:40:03Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":192646,"name":"Hung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hung D.

She has worked the past three years for the City of Juigalpa as a property tax surveyor.  Evelin is requesting her first loan with hopes of acquiring her own home since she currently does not have one.  However, she does have a plot of land on which to build.  Evelin is enrolled in a housing program that will help her with the construction, but she needs to make a down payment in order for the work to begin.  The problem is that she lacks the necessary funds.  For this reason, she is depending on the support of AFODENIC and Kiva so that she can continue in the program.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest wish is to have her own house and make improvements to it so that

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Then her husband came down with a heart condition, and he could no longer work. They decided to invest their capital by buying small commercial properties and then renting them out. This was due to a stroke of good luck, because a friend of her husband\u2019s offered them a piece of land at a good price and they were able to buy it. They began by building one small property and with the rent they received from that, they continued building. They now have 4 properties.<p>Columba is requesting a loan of $550.00 to remodel and make some repairs at one of their properties. They would also like to put a bathroom in another building, because it doesn\u2019t have one. She offers to repay the loan in 5 months.

She is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Romelia F.'s Group.\r\n\r\nRomelia is 45 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Romelia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Romelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Romelia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered. This will be the fourth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and
