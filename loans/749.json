She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   food production, buying and selling medicines, and buying and selling rice. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Orly G., who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have one child who is 11 years old. \r\n\r\nMarlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marlyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,300 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use to buy spices and ingredients for the food she makes. She would like to continue to save up for the future education of her children and family needs.

Bobbie, who has been in the insurance business for nine years, started her business with TWFG Insurance Services in 2007.  Her business offers personal and commercial insurance lines to customers, including health and life insurance.\r\n\r\nBobbie has two employees who work with her in Corpus Christi, as well as agents in Laredo, New Braunfels, and Lufkin (all cities in Texas).  Until now, Bobbie has relied on referrals and word-of-mouth advertising to bring in business, in addition to networking extensively with local realtors and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.  With this loan, she will print and distribute a brochure promoting the services TWFG offers.  Having already established a strong clientele in Corpus Christi, this mail-out will focus on reaching potential clients in nearby towns.  This marketing effort will hopefully generate new business and provide a better understanding of possible new markets.  Bobbie\u2019s long-term goal is to open a second local office, and she will use the response from this mail-out to evaluate potential locations.\r\n\r\nFor Bobbie, owning her own business means that every day is interesting.  With the insurance industry as competitive and time-intensive as it is, she says that \u201cburn-out\u201d is a major problem for insurance agents.  She thinks that she stays engaged because she is always doing different things.  As a single mother, Bobbie says that owning her own business allows her to set her own schedule.  She loves being able to spend time with her son and attend his various activities.\r\n\r\nThis is Bobbie\u2019s second loan with ACCION Texas-Louisiana.

Numan lives in the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Gaza Strip. He is a taxi driver; he took out a loan from FATEN to perform car maintenance. The taxi is the only source of income for the six family members. \r\n\r\nNuman doesn't have enough cash to pay for the car maintenance, therefore FATEN's loan is necessary to improve the family's financial situation.\r\n\r\nNuman appears in the picture next to the taxi. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. \r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. \r\n\r\nAs with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is 54 years old, and is widowed with one adult-aged child. To make a living, Leonora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

En el barrio Bellavista de Malambo, municipio ubicado en el \u00e1rea metropolitana de Barranquilla, todos la conocen porque tiene este negocio que inicio, cuando le llevaban la tela, tomaba medidas, dise\u00f1aba y elaboraba la ropa de acuerdo a lo solicitado y que fue creciendo tanto, que empez\u00f3 a fabricar por tallas y a comercializar en las poblaciones del Departamento del Atl\u00e1ntico. Ella ha pasado por muchas dificultades familiares, pero siempre se ha sobrepuesto y le han servido para mejorar; as\u00ed Fu\u00e8 cuando se separo de su esposo y se mudo sola a Medell\u00edn, ciudad de Colombia reconocida por sus pasarelas de elegancia, glamour y sensibilidad de modistos y dise\u00f1adores colombianos e internacionales; all\u00ec fu\u00e8 donde perfeccion\u00f3 su arte, pues trabajo desde su negocio para dise\u00f1adores de ferias internacionales realizadas en esa ciudad, y pudo, mediante un cr\u00e9dito del estado, reiniciar su negocio e intentar regresar por sus hijos a Malambo, decisi\u00f2n que no concreto porque fue favorecida por subsidios del programa de Familias en Acci\u00f3n del estado y por eso  hace 6 anos, se estableci\u00f2 en esta poblaci\u00f3n para desde all\u00ed apoyar los estudios de sus hijos sin interrumpirlos. \n\nAracelys ingres\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo con el programa de grupos solidarios en el a\u00f1o 1995 y recibi\u00f3 5 cr\u00e9ditos antes de que algunas compa\u00f1eras del grupo empezaran a trabajar en empresas, ella misma cambiara de ciudad y este grupo se desintegrara;  cuando ella regres\u00f2 de Medell\u00edn, encontr\u00f3 nuevamente el apoyo de la Fundaci\u00f3n, adquiri\u00f3 una fileteadora y comenz\u00f3 a trabajar para terceros.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la que solicita un cr\u00e9dito de $2.300.000 que invertir\u00e1 en la compra de una m\u00e1quina industrial, a fin de confeccionar en tela pesada, como la de los jeans y poder tener la suya propia con lo ahorrado por concepto de arriendo. \n\nAracelys Mar\u00eda, sue\u00f1a con adquirir su propia marca, tener una mejor vivienda y ver culminada la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos; su mayor desaf\u00edo es organizar una infraestructura completa para ejercer su arte y ayudar en la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos sin el ingreso de su esposo, por eso duplica sus esfuerzos y tambi\u00e9n se dedica simult\u00e1neamente a la venta de mercanc\u00edas cosm\u00e9tica.","en":" For 21 years, Aracelys Maria Ramirez M., 44 years old, has been dedicated to the profession of seamstress. She is an authentic female head of household who has always participated in productive, reproductive, educational, domestic and community activities to acheive a better future for her 5 children. In the Bellavista de Malambo neighborhood, a town located in the metropolitan area of Baranquilla, everyone knows her. When she started this business, they would take her the fabric, she'd take measurements, and she would design and make the clothing according to what they had ordered. It grew so much that she started to make clothes in sizes and sell them in the towns of the Atlantico Department. She has gone through many family hardships but she has always overcome and they have improved her. That is what happened when she separated from her husband and moved alone to Medellin, a city in Colombia known for its elegant runways, its glamour, and the sense of its Colombian stylists and designers.   She was able, with a state credit, to begin her business again, and try to return for her children to Malambo. This decision didn't happen because she was favored by the Families in Action program of the state and that is why, 6 years ago, she established herself in this town to support her children's studies from there without interruptions.  \r\n\r\nAracelys entered the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with the support groups programs in 1995 and she received 5 loans before some of the other members of the group started to work in businesses, she herself changed towns, and the group began to disintegrate.  When she returned to Medellin, she again found the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n. She acquired a sewing machine and started to work for others. For 2 years she sewed for a clothing wholesaler in a small factory.  Now she does it for a chain of stores that has supplied her with a 2 needle machine, but she must pay rent for the pieces and the work exclusivity. This activity does not make her a lot of money. This is the reason she is asking for a loan of $2.300.000  which she will invest in the purchase of an industrial machine. This will be in order to sew with heavy fabrics, such as denim, and to be able to keep for herself what she pays in rent.  \r\n\r\nAracelys Mar\u00eda dreams of acquiring her own label, having better housing, and finishing her children's education. Her biggest challenge is organizing a complete infrastructure to pracrice her art and help in the education of her children without her husband's income. This is why she doubles her efforts and at the same time sells cosmetic merchandise. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

At 6:00 or 7:00 am, people come to the dam to fish.  They say that the big fish are not easy to trap and weigh about two kilos or more, but they need to take a boat to the middle of the dam to catch them.  \r\n\r\nThe group is called Progreso Mazahua [Mazahua Progress] because the group wants progress, and they come from the community of Mazahua, where adults speak the Mazahua language and children learn it in school.  The group has nine members, seven women and two men.  Members of the group are involved in trade, but also people who have animals: cattle, horses, poultry, and sheep.\r\n\r\nTeresa is the representative of the group.  She works doing embroidery and sewing.  She makes tablecloths, jackets, napkins, and she makes her children's clothes.  Teresa is 39 years old and has been married for nine years.  She has two young children.  The oldest is about to turn five and the youngest is two years old.  They don't go to school yet.  Her husband works buying and selling cattle and raises animals.  They live in their own house.  Teresa wants to help her husband with the household expenses, so she sells her embroidery.  She said a difficulty she has in her business is finding customers who want to purchase her products because few people are interested in purchasing art right now.  \"The loan will give me a lot of help making embroidery and from there I can help with the costs and with the income I can do something else, for example, another business and see the way to improve and pay the loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in his own house, which is constructed of rustic materials. Caciano is a young man who is focused on his responsibilities and works with great conscientiousness to excel with his plantings of cacao. After he harvests the cacao, he takes it to the city of San Francisco to sell. There are various buyers there, who, knowing the quality of his products, don't hesitate to wait for him so that they can buy his harvest wholesale. What he likes most about his work is planting his fields and making them fertile and productive. He has been doing this work for five years. He considers the most difficult part of his work to be fumigating his plantings for pests, since he has to do it with great care, because the chemical products cause reactions and he fears for his future health. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is applying for is for maintaining his crops. In the future, he hopes to continue saving his income, because he wants to buy new fields. This will be his first loan from MFP. He knows that the money from the loan will be very beneficial for the development of his work. He feels happy to belong the group of members of his communal bank. With the 1000 PEN, he will hire day workers so that they can help him in the maintenance of his fields, for example, by pruning, clearing, and fumigating.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":980631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451256}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T17:47:59Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":417570,"name":"Achol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Achol lives in bor.

Jane is a hard working and bold lady who knows what she wants, no matter what. She is the leader of Kanyansheko Bakyara Twimukye group in Ibanda and a widow, with 7 children. All of her children are in O level school. She also cares for many relatives, although they do not stay with her. Jane has had a business of rearing goats for sale for 3 years, in Nyakigando village. The main business challenge is the failure to access drugs for her animals. She is able to make 50,000 UGX as profits per week, hence being able to look after her children.

This is 31-year-old Matron M. from Mbeya. She is married with one  2-year-old child.  Matron has been running a tailoring business since 2007. Her business is making different types of clothes.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Matron currently earns about US$50 a month from her business.

Matron thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":351119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of tailoring material ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matron ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665081},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105793},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022903},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868144},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757340},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146434}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T20:51:36Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Allison Bruce","image":77230}},{"id":125583,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Puquin Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLos socios son un n\u00famero de 16, ellos pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cSE\u00d1OR DE PUQUIN\u201d, ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia y departamento del Cusco. \n\nNuestros socios alternan sus diferentes actividades con el comercio minorista, ellos requieren este capital de trabajo para invertir en sus diferentes negocios peque\u00f1os, ellos venden comida, algunos tienen sus stand en colegios y laboran en el recreo de los alumnos, otros solicitan para aumentar su negocios en el mercado de confraternidad, otras socias tienen un peque\u00f1o cafet\u00edn y tienda de abarrotes, para lo cual solicitan el pr\u00e9stamo.\n\nLos socios agradecen y valoran el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado mediante este medio, y se comprometen a cumplir con el pago en el plazo establecido.\n","en":"There are 16 members in the Se\u00f1or de Puquin Community Bank, which is located in the Huanchac district, Cusco province and department.\r\n\r\nThe members have different small businesses.

They have 2 children, 5 year old Sarai and 2 year old Tany, and the four of them live in their own home located in the rural area of Santa Clara. Their future plan is to acquire their own farm land. For 5 years they have been working hard on rented land where they sow potatoes, peas, beans, and other vegetables which, after each harvest, they sell in the central marked of the city Tarma. Each harvest is a result of Eduardo's hard work and brings him good profits which, thanks to the support of the community bank, he is saving up. In very little time he will be able to buy his own land. He predicts that this will bring him greater income and he will be able to buy much more. This is his sixth loan from MFP, and he is grateful for the lessons offered to the bank members which motivate him to be successful and think of the future. He will use this loan to buy organic fertilizer which he will apply to his \"arenosa\" variety potatoes which he will be harvesting in the coming months. He will also buy pea seeds.

His wife runs a grocery shop and they have two children aged four years old and one year old whom they wish to give a good education to the university level. His business is located at the busy Kibuye market in Kisumu. Kisumu is the region in Kenya that harbors Lake Victoria and is commonly referred to as the lake basin.\r\n\r\nCliffton runs a carpentry shop in which he makes beds, cupboards, couches and other things for the local people. He has been operating this business for nine years now and has managed to provide employment to two people. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is financial constraints.

He has 10 years of experience working as a car mechanic.  In 2005, he opened his own car repair shop. He states that his business income is barely sufficient to satisfy his needs. So from time to time, he also works in a locA. company in order to earn extra money and be able to meet his financiA. obligations.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and a loving and responsible father of one child.  Since 1999, he has been working in the business arena and has a rich enough experience to continue and expand his business.  He is involved in buying and selling dried fruits and animal husbandry.  He has received several loans from Imon International and repaid all of them successfully.  This loan would allow Tuichiboi to expand his business and, thus, pay for his son to go to a university.  His life would improve quite a bit, and he is grateful to all for the support.

He earns a living by selling clothing, blankets and covers.  Due to his family\u2019s economic situation, he was unable to continue studying.  For the past 5 years he has worked and progressed little by little to earn a salary.  William really likes what he does, thanks to this job he has hopes for a better future.

He has to endure the cold at night and the strong heat during the day, but William always does his best because he knows that every sacrifice has a reward.  He is a new member of his community bank and is applying for his first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He will be very punctual with his payments because he is very grateful for this opportunity and will not disappoint the people who trust him.  With this money he will increase the number of blankets to sell in order to increase his earnings and help his business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":258401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"buy blankets to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T17:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423640},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116909},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011830},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595424},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989671},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":168.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210792}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T19:25:10Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":88735,"name":"Mrs. Saroeurn Chev Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thirteen people living in Tang Kley village in Kampong Chhnang province comprise this village bank loan, and they will use the loan for various purposes.

The official name of this borrowing group is the Revelita C. group.\r\n\r\nRevelita is married and has eight adult children. To make a living, she owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal products such as glasses and watches in the local community. Revelita has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Revelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Revelita is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the eighth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas.

Planea con esta inversi\u00f3n generar mayores ingresos porque con mas mesas sus clientes no necesitan esperar para jugar, teniendo en cuenta que se acercan las vacaciones de final de a\u00f1o, se incrementan clientes oriundos del pueblo y tambi\u00e9n  turistas  que  se aglomerar\u00e1n en su negocio y se aumentan las ventas de productos y servicios, en especial en el local de Dirio que est\u00e1 en un corredor comercial concurrido que todo el pueblo conoce, alrededor del cual hay muchos negocios como tiendas panader\u00edas y ferreter\u00edas.\nSu sue\u00f1o es ver a sus tres hijos realizados como profesionales exitosos y tambi\u00e9n lograr que su negocio est\u00e9 provisto de aire acondicionado para ofrecer confort a sus clientes.\n\nEl  mayor desaf\u00edo que ha enfrentado Diro en su vida,  ha sido la muerte de su esposa, hace apenas seis meses  por eso  aun se encuentra en proceso de duelo, pues fue de una manera intempestiva y ella era su mayor soporte emocional, en el negocio y en el hogar en especial en todo lo relacionado con el apoyo  de sus hijos ; as\u00ed que toda la familia la extra\u00f1a .\n \n\n\n","en":"El Carmen is a municipality located in the valley called \u201cMontes de Mar\u00eda,\u201d in the center of the department of Bol\u00edvar, a land which inspired Lucho Berm\u00fadez with the eyes of love to compose the beautiful \"Porro\" which carries his name. This is the place where Diro Enrique lives and operates his business, which he started eight (8) years ago. Taking advantage of the space where he started his business, today he has a game room where he sells drinks and also has a pool room that brings together a large part of the local population for healthy entertainment. He is a widower with three children, aged 18, 22 and 26, who are studying for university and technical degrees thanks to his effort, and two are also working at the same time. \n\nThis is his first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and he plans to use it to buy several pool tables as well as drinks by the case, and he will also carry out some repairs to his place of business. With this investment, he plans to generate more income, because with more pool tables, his customers will not have to wait to play. Taking into account that the end-of-year vacations are approaching, there will be more local customers from the area and also more tourists who will gather in his shop, increasing his sales of products and services. They will come especially to Diro's business, because it is located in a busy commercial corridor known to everyone, surrounded by many businesses such as bakeries and hardware stores. \n\nHis dream is to see his three children become successful professionals and also to equip his business with air conditioning, to offer more comfort to his customers. \n\nThe greatest challenge Diro has confronted in his life has been the death of his wife, just six months ago. He is still in the grieving process, because it was an untimely loss and she was his greatest emotional support, in the business and especially at home with everything concerning the support of his children; because of this, the whole family misses her.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Through hard work and self determination, Juliana is doing well in providing the basic needs for her kids, especially their education.

Hokimboy is 30 years old, married, and has three children. All of his life he has devoted himself to agricultural work, and on market days he brings his products to the market.\r\n\r\nFor Hokimboy the harvest is what he enjoys the most and he devotes a lot of time to sorting potatoes and carrots that he will sell, because the price will depend on the size.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives in Pisac, which lies in Calca Province, Department of Cusco.  Pisac is located 40 minutes away from the city.  It is small town that inherited beautiful Incan structures, which is required sightseeing by all tourists who visit the city of Cusco.\r\n<p>\r\nCeferina is 56 years old, in a common law marriage, and has four children (ages 35, 33, 32, and 14).  She divides her time between her household activities and her small business.  Ceferina sells food at the market.  She tried selling in different places but found the artisan\u2019s fair in Pisac to be the most profitable.

The group was formed at the initiative of mothers who wanted to develop businesses, but found it difficult to secure the necessary capital to do so, as the loan application process at banks is complicated and burdensome.\r\nKWT Tiing Gading has 20 members and spans a wide range of businesses, from farming to trading to home-based businesses such as making cookies and chips. Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) Koperasi is working with Kiva to provide the necessary funding for these women to develop their businesses.\r\nKWT Tiing Gading has a leadership team that is comprisesd of three members: Ni Putu Eka Yulianti (Chairman), Ni Made Mili Kasih (Secretary) and Ni Komang Mahayani (Treasurer). \r\nOne of the borrowers, Ni Komang Mahayani, who is also the Treasurer in the leadership team, is a housewife whose tough day-to-day work is to make and supply a variety of cakes to shops or individual customers. In particular, when there are religious ceremonies approaching, cake orders will multiply as Komang Mahayani makes better and more expensive cakes than the artificial cakes and snacks sold in stores. Komang Mahayani is applying for loans through MUK, which will be used to increase her working capital. She will use the additional profit she earns to finance her children\u2019s education, as one is waiting to enter school and the other is currently attending Junior High School.\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.  As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":486664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"As capital to develop the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-02-11T04:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang Kardi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Netri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Karseni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayu Putu Suci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Sulendri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Denis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Sujani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Murti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Derti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah Seni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Ardani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu Eka Yulianti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made Dermi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Kadek Mili Kasih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Wiryati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suryani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang Mahayani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Darwati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Dentri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayu Putu Sukerti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":15000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1600,"local_amount":15000000,"processed_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":15000000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878553}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T11:13:21Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":179512,"name":"Mariano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl Sr. Mariano nacido el 2 de junio en Villa Barrientos en 1980 casado con do\u00f1a flora y con un hijo peque\u00f1o, el trabaja de agricultor en su propia parcela en ca\u00f1ada sthrogers hace 11 a\u00f1os, en la cual siembra yuca, maiz, y sorgo para hacer escoba y todo lo que produce el saca ha vender al mercado de el torno, es una persona responsable y trabajadora que saca a su familia adelante, esta  muy agradecida con Emprender y Kiva por la confianza brindada en la otorgacion del credito. \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t","en":"Mariano was born in Villa Barrientos on July 2, 1980.

Yen is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 03-\u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16-04-03 \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i).\r\n\r\n\r\nYen is married and has one infant child.  To make a living, Yen operates a family member's business harvesting & selling river-caught fish in the local community.  Yen has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1,700,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Yen joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Yen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,963,500 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She is now requesting a new loan of 3,079,800 VND, which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by Yen from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Yen plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

This has been the bedrock for the growth of 40-year-old K.

They live together as a family in their own home, located in the locality of La Union Palomar (central Peruvian jungle). The primary product of this region is coffee. But Oscar has been planting not only this product but also bananas, corn, and yucca for the past 20 years.  These produce good harvests and as a result, good earnings. But as a good agriculturist he is inexhaustible so when he has some spare time (which is not much!) he works as an electrician as promoted by the Peruvian state, bringing electricity to the distant villages in the Peruvian Amazon. With the funds he generates with this employment, Oscar hopes to obtain extra funds to improve his cultivations. He wants to be recognized not only by his buyers but also by the coffee cooperatives who are always in search of good coffee beans. He has already taken the first step with the orientation he received. He learned about the germination process, packaging, and coffee plant transplantation. He is a member of the communal bank \"La Union Hace la Fuerza del Palomar\", meaning \"Unity is the Strength of Palomar\" and it is his second loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He is proud to be part of a communal bank where the members are very responsible and honest. This is the reason he will make his payments on time.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Summer is wedding season, so she sews dresses and caps for brides and in winter she knits woolen clothes to provides warmth. <p>Her business brings a good income to her family. She has three years of experience in this business. For the loan amount for $1000, Matluba is going to buy materials for dresses and national caps.

She has nine children ranging in age from 3 to 20 years old. She is married to Danilo Moteno, a 50-year-old fisherman. Glody and her family live in the North Peninsula of Antique, which is in Pandan. The place is rich in natural resources. Pandan is surrounded by verdant mountains and a blue ocean that sparkles during the day time. \r\n\r\nHaving been trained in cosmetology, such as manicures, pedicures, hair cutting, and hair curling, Glody has been practicing her trade for the last three years. This has been her business and her source of income. With the profits from her business, she has helped her husband to augment the family income. \r\n\r\nGlody's ASHI loan has supported her business and her husband's fishing business. Because she was able to repay her first loan, she is now qualified to apply for another loan for a higher amount. She plans use this loan, and future loans, to invest in her growing business. She wishes that some day she will own a beauty shop in their village where she can give her custumers comfort and good quality services.\r\n\r\nGlody hopes that all of her children will graduate from college. That is why she wants her business to succeed. Her loan from ASHI is a very important factor that could lead her toward fulfillment. \r\n\r\n

Mrs. S. and her husband, Mr. Clemente S., work hard together to support their four children.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. S. started her sari-sari (general) store soon after she joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was determined to help her husband earn additional income for the family. But Mrs. S. didn't stop at her sari-sari store. She continued to look for other investment opportunities and sources of income, and she decided to try the fishing business. \r\n<p>\r\nUsing the loan she got from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she bought a motorized boat and fish nets, and started her fishing venture which, over time, proved to be a lucrative source of income for her and her family. For her 22nd loan cycle she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she plans to use partly to buy additional fishing equipment and the other part as additional capital for her sari-sari store. Part of the income from these ventures she hopes to save for her children's education.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her brothers help her verify that the animals she acquires are in good health.  Each time she goes to the animal commercialization sites, she is sure to ask for her purchase record, which allows her to calculate her profits.  She then sells the purchased animals in the most well known livestock markets in the area.  This business has been very profitable for her because she hardly invests any money in the maintenance of the animals; she only has them in her care for a few days, until the weekend.  Furthermore, the profit she receives for each head of livestock is considerable.  In the future, she wants to increase her working capital and be able to purchase a greater quantity of animals.  This is her third opportunity to receive a loan, and she promises to be very responsible with her payments.  She thanks all those who made the loan possible.  It will be very useful to her in advancing her business.  Betty plans to invest the requested money in the purchase of additional heads of livestock, and in that way she will increase her working capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":512484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"She will purchase several heads of livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462841}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T01:13:19Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":192042,"name":"Jude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jude is a 45-year-old married man who has three children in school.

G. represents the Rayito de Luz [Little Ray of Light] group, located in the community of Felipe Neri, Tlalnepantla, in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  The group has five members, who are neighbors.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  The members of the group are: Silvia M. Granada, who will use her loan to buy merchandise including soft drinks, cookies, chips, and candy to stock up her grocery store; Gloria A. C., who  plans to buy a griddle, roofing for her locale, tables and chairs, and vegetables, tomatoes, and green tomatoes to make her Mexican street foods; Silvia G. R., who plans to buy sacks of organic fertilizer to treat her trees so she can grow fruit; Armada G. R., who will purchase loads of corn to make her handmade tortillas; and Felipa Garc\u00eda S., who plans to buy broad beans, pumpkins, peaches, and limes in bulk wholesale to stock up her store.\r\n\r\nSilvia is thirty-years-old.  She completed her third year of secondary school and has her certificate.  She lives in a common-law marriage and has four sons.  Carlos \u00c1ngel, 12, and Jos\u00e9 Ismael, 8 are both in school.  Jorge Eduardo and Luis Eduardo are 3-year-old twins.  She has a grocery store called the \u201cLos \u00c1ngeles Grocery.\u201d  She is seeking a loan to buy chips, cookies, Bimbo-brand bread, soft drinks, water, candy, peanuts, chocolate candies, and gummies to offer her customers.  Most of them are tourists driving by on the highway who stop to rest and buy things at her store, or students and neighbors who come during the rainy and cold seasons looking to buy water and soft drinks.  Her son Carlos \u00c1ngel helps her out in the store.  \r\n\r\nSilvia started her business four years ago, after noting that where she lived beside the highway was a thoroughfare for tourists and seemed like a good place to have a grocery store.  Her husband gave her the money to open and stock the store.  She\u2019s very happy with the loan she\u2019s going to get because it will give her the opportunity to invest in her business.  The business is very important to her because of the financial support it provides.  It brings in extra income, she\u2019s got money for everyday needs, and she wants for nothing at home.  If her sons want something, they can have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate in Felipe Neri is refreshing.  There are lots of trees and vegetation, and the Chichinautzin Corredor passes through there.  It\u2019s a protected area with heavily-treed forests with deer and panthers in them.  The people plant forage food like oats and corn for the animals.  In December when it\u2019s really cold the water crystallizes into a layer of ice.  \r\n\r\nSilvia\u2019s business has helped her family because she uses what she makes for household expenses or any other expenses that might worry her.  She wants to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cI appreciate the kind of help you give us and I am going to try not to embarrass myself so you\u2019ll keep supporting me with additional loans.\u201d  Her dream is to better herself, stand out, and most of all, grow the business into something better, and add new products.  She will reinvest her earnings and support her sons so they can have a profession.  Her store does face competition; there\u2019s another one next door to hers. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":583714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy chips, cookies, bread, soft drinks, and water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Felipe Neri, estado de Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-08-23T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia                                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":314.06,"local_amount":3937.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3992.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854285},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5323.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121184},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415301},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415302},{"amount":104.68,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415303},{"amount":104.69,"local_amount":1312.5,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1330.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415304},{"amount":523.44,"local_amount":6562.5,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6654.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554939}],"funded_date":"2010-08-23T09:52:27Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":228914,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennifer D. is from the village of Cabaruan.

This area is known for its grand vegetation, but most of all, for beautiful fresh water spas that are frequented by local and foreign tourists.\r\n\r\nThis is where we find Viviana, who is 22 years old and married.  The result of this beautiful relationship is a three-year-old daughter, who is her most precious treasure.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a wonderful mother and homemaker, she dedicates herself to commerce.  She sells all types of clothing door-to-door, and also has several customers that place orders since the clothing she carries is select.  She works Saturdays and Sundays from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm, taking advantage of the fact that her mother can care for her daughter on those days.
