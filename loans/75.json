In order to help her husband with the household expenses, she decided to start her own business selling clothing and lottery tickets. She sells all types of clothing door to door. She also delivers clothing to people's homes. She says that she sells the clothes on credit and collects every week. This is an advantage, she says, because selling on credit increases the price and she makes more profit. In addition, when she collects, she makes more sales.

She lives with her husband and two children in a  traditional woven-bambo walled, asbestos roofed and dirt floored house. The house is near the river bank, so they can take a bath and do laundry in the river. The house also serves as her business place. Together with her husband, she sells fish chips. Siti does the production and her husband sells the chips around the village. Their daily profit can go as high as 60,000 IDR (1USD~9,000 IDR). With a living cost of 30,000 per day they can still save a little. The loan will be used to increase the working capital. They receive an increase of orders during the month of Ramadan.

Keuntungan per hari mereka dapat mencapai Rp 60.000,00. Dengan biaya hidup Rp 30.000,00 per hari, mereka masih bisa menabung. Pinjaman yang dia dapatkan akan digunakan untuk menambah modal usaha.

She lives with her husband and their children in M\u00e9dine, one of the popular areas of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region in the republic of Mali). Having not had the chance to move forward in school for social reasons, she started businesses buying and selling dyed damasks, ginger, bed sheets, shoes, soaps, etc. more than ten years ago. She buys and sews pieces of dyed damask into men's shirts in order to sell them. She is sought after by her clientele, which is comprised of her husband\u2019s neighbors and colleagues, due to the quality of her products. In order to better satisfy her growing clientele, she has decided to turn to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for the last five years. After 6 group loans with a neighborhood women\u2019s association (Association BENKADI de M\u00e9dine), she is on her fifth individual loan, and all of her previous loans have been properly repaid.  She plans to use this loan to buy 15 suits of dyed damask, 4 pieces of Wax fabrics, 20 sets of sheets, 2 boxes of soaps, 5 pairs of women\u2019s shoes, etc. She stocks up at Bobo Dioulasso (republic of Burkina Faso) and then sells her stock from home or traveling around the city of Sikasso for cash or credit. She foresees earning 100,000 CFA francs in monthly profit from this loan, which will essentially be used to increase her business, contribute to her family expenses, repay her loan, and reinvest into her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":304527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy miscellaneous items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aga\u00efssa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621247},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020206},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242960},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678704},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112575},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028147},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873519},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763263},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152071},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123990996}],"funded_date":"2009-05-03T16:17:49Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":106165,"name":"Petronila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petronila is married to Jessie T. who works as a tricycle driver in their village.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Sefulu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sefulu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 talas or US $117 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sefulu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sefulu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Since she was very young, she has worked hard for the well-being of her family and has had a variety of jobs.  Currently she sells condiments.  This business generates the necessary economic income for her to provide a high quality of life to her family.  She offers these condiments in a market that is near the area where she lives.  She prepares various sauces and spices like ocopa (a spicy sauce made of peanuts, chili peppers, and herbs), chili sauces, ground garlic, and others.  The housewives in the area prefer her and frequently acquire their sauces from her to prepare their food quickly.\r\n\r\nShe also sells various beauty products by catalog to her friends and people she knows.  In the future, she wants to establish a more stable business and to administer it from her home.  She feels at peace with her jobs because she wants to get ahead little by little.

Every morning she wakes up very early to drive to her fields to tend her coffee plants. She does this with her husband, and they have been working in agriculture for 8 years. What she likes most is to have high-quality crops because this means that her crops can be sold quickly and get good prices. However, it is difficult to move their crop to the different markets where they are sold as they are very delicate. Because her job is profitable, she has been able to build her own house and buy some agricultural land that brings her good profits, and she is very proud of these achievements.

She earns her living by operating a business venture to buy and sell scrap gold. Her husband Falconiere G., who is 54 years old, works as a welder to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 31 and 34 years old. Rebecca joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF- Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and to support the maintenance of the family.  Rebecca G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. Her photo was taken during the end of her weekly center meeting because her scrap gold was already sold.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her partner with whom she has a 3 year old daughter. They live in their own home where they share the happiness of educating and bringing up their daughter and they put forth all their strength and make the necessary sacrifices in order to provide her a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nElena\u2019s work consists of selling sweets and products that children enjoy eating. She has a stand where she sells her sweets. It is located in one of the busiest parks in the city. Her day normally begins at 8:00AM in the morning and finishes at 6:00PM in the afternoon. During this time she takes advantage of any moments when sales are low to go see her daughter who is still very young and needs a lot of attention. It is one of the things that complicate her work, but too it is something that she knows will soon pass, as each day her daughter grows a bit more.\r\n\r\nThe thing that she like most about her work is the freedom that she has to do other activities at the same time she is at her sweet stand. She has been doing this for three years and what she considers the most difficult thing about her work is having to be under the relentless sun all day. She hopes that with time she will be able to have a store where she can serve her clients better. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 7th loan with MFP. She has always been a good member of the communal bank which she likes very much because of the care and unity.

Meshark works as a subsistence farmer for a living. His community of Koogo Kochieng village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne disease. Meshark is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected promoter by his village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Meshark represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Meshark and two other promoters in his community, namely Lonna and Emily, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Meshark wants to be a promoter because he believes that the dispenser system will help treat water making it safe and preventing water-borne diseases in the community.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Meshark\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meshark ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lonna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992918,"name":"Jackson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jackson is a hardworking man who lives Masindi district.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before, she and her husband are partners in their business the bamboo set making. But considering their age, the business is quite tiring and laborious. When she received her first loan from ASHI, she constructed a fish cage in the lake. That was four years ago already. Now her business is getting bigger and brings her good income.\nNow on her 4th loan, she proposes a loan of 18,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish cage business. The loan will be used to pay for 2 fish cages, renovation and repair of her other fish cages, 30 pieces of bamboos and labor expenses.\nShe is looking forward that with the trend of fishing as main source of income in the island is in demand; her business will grow and will bring her enough income for her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To that end, NWTF offers green energy products designed to save money for its clients. In a partnership with SunTransfer and Arc Finance, NWTF distributes solar-powered lanterns that also function as a charging station for mobile phones. Since many families normally use kerosene lamps to light their homes, the solar lantern offers a free, environment-friendly renewable source of energy, that allows them to reduce their monthly fuel costs.   \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She owns a business, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Senia has 5 years of experience in this business.  Senia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nThis is Senia's third loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Senia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Besides repaying the loan, the group members use part of their revenues to meet family expenses. \u00a0In the days to come, the women plan on obtaining bigger loans to expand their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":549235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying ingredients to make beignets ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Tominian ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-06T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961611},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699735},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913636},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180773},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476741},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613451}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T16:54:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":209459,"name":"Joffre Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Joffre de 29 a\u00f1os, vive en las Orqu\u00eddeas de Guayaquil, su casa es de cemento aun no terminada de construir,  solo cuenta con alcantarillado y luz como servicios basicos, el es guardia de seguridad y tiene una ni\u00f1a de tres a\u00f1os.\n\nJoffre  se caso muy joven y tuvo que trabajar y ya no seguir estudiando para darles una mejor viva a su familia, pero como los ingresos de el no superan el presupuesto que tiene para construir su casa el quiere comprar con el pr\u00e9stamo cemento, bloques y hierros para que su esposa e hija puedan vivir en mejores condiciones. \n\nEl quiere un buen futuro para su familia, y tiene pensado en un futuro independizarse y tener su propio negocio para asegurar el futuro de su familia. \n","en":"\r\nJoffre, 29, lives in Las Orqu\u00eddeas, Guayaquil, in a concrete house that is still unfinished; the only utilities it has are electricity and sewage.

She is one of the leading fabrics vendors in the market where she works. She is very determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for eight years. Gulchehra is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Gulchehra has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

After high school, without financial support, she began to help her mother to sell baby clothes at the market in 1995, and got a taste for it.  Since then, her chance presented itself when she found some money, and she too began a business selling baby clothes in 2000 with a starting capital of 10,000 frs.  With this loan, she wants to strengthen her business by buying dozens of bedtime clothes, knitted goods, bibs, baby's tops, covers, pacifiers, bed linens, powder and other necessaries.  She has a daily receipt of between 20,000 and 35,000 frs.  Her clients are pregnant women who frequent the market, despite difficulties arising from a break-down in the supply of merchandise from her providers.  Her strategy is to have a large variety of merchandise, to create a good reception area, to have a good window display in order to better satisfy the needs of her client\u00e8le.  She would like to have a boutique in the future and to be a wholesaler, as well as to make journeys to buy merchandise and to improve her children's schooling conditions.

","en":"Pedro is 39 years old. He has made a living from agriculture since he was 15 years old. From that age he began to help his father who all of his life worked in agriculture. Now, he works in that sector. He decided to undertake this activity because it is close to his home and has been a family tradition. Furthermore, he did not have the opportunity to be able to prepare himself academically since his father was not able to provide studies to him as his father helped cultivate corn. Currently, Pedro wants to cultivate five hectares of land and provide a better investment to his crops.\r\n\r\nThe loan that he is requesting is to purchase seeds, compost, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and to pay farmhands to cultivate the five hectares of land. His standard of living will improve since he will have a better income which will be used to make the loan payments and to help his parents a little more. Thus, he will have a greater possibility of improving himself and having a more peaceful life.\r\n\r\nPedro\u2019s dream is to be able to cultivate more land to have a higher income so that his son is able to graduate from school and so be able to continue with his studies since he did not have this opportunity. He wants his son to study and he knows that he can do so with the help of this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1583966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase seeds, compost, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and to pay farmhands to cultivate 5 hectares of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"El Transito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-03-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":992934,"name":"Raban","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raban is a farmer rearing chicken and goats.

She works selling groceries in her house, which is located on Jaen Street in the Vista Alegre neighborhood of the city of Moyabamba. She started her business with a credit from the community bank and went along growing her business, little by little. She started with a table on which she displayed a few products. The business has grown thanks to her effort and the good service she provides to her clients. Lucia decided to start the business despite not being able to count on the support of her husband because she is a very hard working person with good business skills. What's more, generating her own income  nourishes her self esteem and allows her to contribute to the expenses of  helping her children get ahead. <p>This loan of 1800 soles (Peruvian currency), which she'll repay in 4 months, will buy groceries such as rice, sacks of sugar,  boxes of milk of many different sizes and brands, boxes of oil,  packages of detergents, boxes of noodles, onions, sacks of garlic, and other products to better stock her business. She wants her clients to find what they are looking for when they come to her store; her sales are stronger when she offers a variety of merchandise. She takes advantage of the fact that she has no competition in her neighborhood.<p> Lucia is 37 years old with 3 children. She now has her husband's help in the business, as well. Lucia is happy with what she does and satisfied by the resuilts she has achieved up to now. Her clientele has grown, which also has helped her improve her economic situation and contribute to covering the family 's expenses. Her goal is to one day have a kiosk across from her house. A grade school is currently under construction there, and she wants to be prepared when it opens for classes so that she can increase her business by selling refreshments. <p><p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer.<p><\/b>La se\u00f1ora Lucia es socia del banco comunal La Amistad del distrito y provincia de Moyabamba, departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

Now she lives with her youngest child, who is married, and her three grandchildren, who all go to school.  <P>\r\n\r\nLorta began her school studies very late, due to a lack of means.  Her father abandoned her when she was an infant, leaving her with her mother, a simple farmer.  He said that he was going to work in neighboring South Africa and has never returned to this day.  At age 15 Lorta began her studies and made it through second grade in the old educational system.  Then she became pregnant and stopped her studies, having to take care of her three children, who later lost their lives in wartime.  Lorta was quite hopeless after the death of her children, and was invited to live with her sister invited in Namaacha, a village on the border of Swaziland.  After she arrived there, Lorta worked as a domestic worker for five years.  With the money she saved, she began her own business.  She built her own house with the earnings from her business.  But the expenses for her child's wedding left her almost bankrupt, and she requested a loan from Hluvuku (Kiva's Field Partner) for 8,000 <em>meticais<\/em> (MT) to bolster the value of her business.  She very successfully repaid the loan.  This current loan of 10,000 MT will be used to increase the volume of stock for her business, for which she travels once a week.  She sells twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, at the informal market, Shoprite, where there is an exchange of products coming from other countries and she makes a profit of 5,000 MT.  Lorta takes care of her mother, who lives with her in her house, and also is able to save 1,000 MT per month.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Lorta's second loan from Hluvuku and the first with Kiva.  The first 8,000 MT were used to strengthen her business, and these 10,000 MT will be used to increase the volume of her inventory.  She is confident that she will repay the loan early and will ask for another loan to finish the house of her only child.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

Mahmadsolih is married and the father of four children. He works as a farmer everyday. Educated until secondary school, he had to quit early because he couldn't afford to attend. Bestowed with a good work ethic, Mahmadsolih has wholeheartedly committed himself to agriculture. Thanks to his hard work, he has today become a man known for his determination and serves as an example and reference for other farmers. He is growing vegetables: potato, onion, carrot and others. Mahmadsolih is now seeking a loan of $3,000 US to buy seeds, mineral fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his crops in the hopes of being well prepared for the upcoming season and to produce a good harvest at the end of the season. He can then better meet the needs of his family and improve his work conditions.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business is important because it allows her to earn income to eat, pay for expenses, and for when she falls ill.

He works to support his family by selling footwear at a busy central market called \u201cPanjshanbeh\u201d. Abdumalik has been in business for about eight years and makes around $200-$300 per month. Eventually he would like to open a second vending location to increase his sales and profits. Abdumalik has requested a loan of $1,500 USD to add to his working business capital. He has developed a good reputation and credit history with IMON International. We look forward to many more opportunities to assist Abdumalik with the success of his business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Irene will educate her children and pay back her loans.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Pamba W. group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Irene with her group members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":933295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnetta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samwel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Osebon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":88550,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88550}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":88550,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":90250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681169}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T02:47:47Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":369323,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen has been operating a salon for six years.

She is married and has two children, one of whom is already 24, while the other one is only 6 and a half years old. Additionally, she is responsible for taking care of two other children whose parents do not have the means to support the family. \nCostancia earns income through various businesses, including raising kuku (chickens), making baskets, and making vinyagos. \nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chicken in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. The activity requires little start-up capital and space, and, while the chicken are growing, they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \nDue to Costancia's business skills, she has also managed to develop a successful vinyagos-sales venture. A vinyago is a beautiful, hand-crafted statue made from wood by members of the Makonde tribe who come from southeastern Tanzania. Woodcarving is an important part of Makonde life, both in ancestor worship and in their own myth of creation. Their wooden statues are of three main types: traditional masks, motifs of female ancestor worship, as well as more abstract, modern forms.\n\nCostancia works 9-12 hours a day, 6 days a week at her different enterprises with the assistance of one employee.  She currently needs a loan of US$550 in order to expand her businesses. Contancia thanks everyone for their support.\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":223015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-22T09:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Costancia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970733},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886950},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436210},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130483},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027284},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613307},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010390},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232701},{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":77777.76,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664517}],"funded_date":"2008-11-24T03:18:50Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77541,"name":"Sokheang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokheang S., 33, and her husband, Mr. Neang Ny, 32,  live in a small village across the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

He is married and supports five people.  Currently he lives in the city of his birth with his family and is a motorbike mechanic.  But with the economic crisis cutting across our country, his business no longer allows him to provide for his family.  He wants to add to his previous business by including commerce in lamp fuel, which he buys at the pump and resells.  This commerce works in the prefecture because of the cuts in electricity from which this particular region of the country suffers.   The income derived from this business will enable him to repay the loan and to cope with the needs of his family. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

They are all working.\r\n\r\nShe started her studies very late because of the lack of transportation, she was born at Mandevo which is 10km from the municipality of Namaachaa. When she was 12 she went to live to her aunt's house and was able to start studying. When she was on the 3rd grade she got pregnant and lost her school vacancy, the same year she started living with her husband who was a guard at the frontier, years later he lost his life and Celina ended up desperate.

His greatest wish is to help with household expenses to that his family can get ahead.  With is trusty cart, Jaime goes out daily to sell his delicious popcorn.  He sets himself up on one of the city's main square's busiest corners where he sees many customers, who come to him because he serves better portions than his competitors and, in addition, he is very personable while tending to his customers.  What he likes the most about his work is that it leaves his mornings free to pursue his university studies.  He has been engaged in this line of work for 3 years and he considers the most difficult part of his job having to work nights withstanding the rains and intense cold.  In time, he hopes to gather enough money to have a store from which to sell his popcorn more comfortably.  This is his third loan with MFP.  He is very happy to have credit and is willing to repay punctually.  He is well liked in his communal bank because he is the most cheerful of them all.

With it, he now offers a taxi service, and through this he has been able to earn extra income.

The pineapples are ultimately brought to collection centres in their area.\r\nHonorato thanks his family for the support and help that they give him in the most difficult moments, and for this reason he wants to open a clothing sales store, with the aim of expanding his market and improving his family's quality of life. This is his sixth loan with MFP, and he is committed to continuing to fulfill his repayment obligations. Furthermore, he thanks the institution for the responsibility.

She has 15 years of experience working as a farmer. She has been running her own farm since 2001. She uses plastic tents to grow her products. These tents also allow her to better monitor product quality as well as grow her products for more months during the year. She cultivates all type of vegetables and fruits all through the year. She works independently in her business. \r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting a loan of $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase needed supplies for her agricultural work and seeds for the next cultivation. She estimates that the loan will help her increase her profits by 20%. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling vegetables in the community. Francisca has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Francisca joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Francisca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Francisca is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Francisca from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

","en":"Diana H. is a 24-year-old woman who lives in the municipality of Soledad and has a one-year-old child. With the help of her husband, who was laid off 3 years ago, and to help him take advantage of his entrepreneurial potential and feel useful and productive, Diana was able to start her business selling merchandise with an initial purchase of 18 pairs of shoes and 6 sets of bedcovers, which she sold. Following this, she was able to achieve a good income; this investment was successful thanks to the good response from her potential customers for home products in the municipality of Luruaco, Sabanalarga in the Department of Atl\u00e1ntico, and La Loma in the Department of Cesar, where some of her family members and those of her husband live. Currently, in these municipalities, she has been able to develop her customer base, and since she knows them very well, she can grant them credit and obtain the return on her investment every 15 days.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T18:40:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalini  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970736},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886953},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436213},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130486},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027286},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613309},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010392},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232703},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664519}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T20:24:05Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77557,"name":"Doris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doris E. is 26 years old and is married with two children.

He is the father of 4 children with ages between 5 and 18 years old, all of whom are in school. \r\n\r\nEduardo had to interrupt his studies in the 7th grade when he was recruited to complete Mandatory Military Service in Zambezia for 2 years.

He was transferred to the capital Maputo and was able to continue with his studies and through promotions, due to his level, rise to the rank of police sergeant of Mozambique earning a monthly salary of 4.109.00MT.\r\n \r\nHe has already had a loan with the Commercial Bank (International Bank of Mozambique with the value of  25.000,00MT to start his project) which he paid by debiting from his salary and when he finished he did not request another loan as the required conditions do not permit rapid development (mandatory terms of 5 years to repay the loan).\r\n\r\nIn a conversation with his

There are many persons in the city of Tarija who are involved in similar activities so their businesses are progressing slowly.

They need machinery like spinning machines and other tools which will allow them to produce better finished items to be able to compete in higher producing markets thereby providing their families with a better quality of life.

A. is a 32-year-old woman living in the town of Puleia.  She is married and has 5 school-aged children.  Iulieta runs a fishing business, \r\nselling ocean-caught fish in the local community.  Iulieta has been in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 360 Samoan tala (about $143 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Iulieta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Iulieta is requesting a loan of 1000 tala which will be used to purchase a fishing boat.  This will be her first loan from SPBD. Iulieta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Occidental Province. She is 65 years old. Exaltacion is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Exaltacion owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting coconuts for sale. Exaltacion has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Exaltacion joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Exaltacion has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used for additional business capital. Exaltacion is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Exaltacion from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

During planting and harvesting season, she needs the help of farm workers. Roc\u00edo is at her small farm from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM during the week, which is why her sales have been gradually increasing since her produce is sold at the wholesale centers in her community.

She is married and has one child, who is not in school. Milly has a business selling phone air time, which she has had for two years. \r\n<p>\r\nTo help expand her business, Milly is requesting a loan of 100,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more air time for selling. Milly hopes that the loan will help her by allowing her to add more capital to her business. In the future, Milly hopes to open up another business (a saloon).\r\n<p>\r\nNote to lenders:\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n<p>\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n<p>\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50,"image":{"id":573827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile

Once these women joined the program, they decided to form another group, inviting their friends and neighbors. In this way the 12th of June group was founded in the Barrio San de Yka'a in the city of Luque. One of the members is Lorena C., who makes a living selling charcoal, which is an activity that is convenient for her in every way because she can do it from her home and earn good profits, and it's also very easy to manage and sell this product.
