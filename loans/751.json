","en":"Carlos is 44 years old.  He has been living common-law with his partner for four years; they have a daughter aged 1 year and 8 month.  They are currently living with his in-laws.  He has had many jobs since he was a young man, but never had formal employment.  Since 2002 however he has had a kiosk, his own electronics shop called \"G.\", strategically located where there are many passers-by.  He repairs radios and television sets; this is his passion and he is very happy doing this job.  He also buys used electronics which he repairs, replacing missing parts and reselling them for a good profit.  Carlos says that when it is not time to harvest the coffee beans, people do not have money and then do not need his services; but, when harvest time comes in April, his income improves to 400 to 500 soles per week not including the income from selling used televisions and radios.  His wife sells clothing and he wants to help her with part of the loan which he is requesting and so encourage the growth of his businesses.

For 4 years, he's operated a business repainting cars, work that he began doing as an employee of another garage.  He now has his own business which is successful because he works with great care.  He keeps working for however long he has to so that he can complete the jobs he's charged with on time.  He is well paid for his labor, something that encourages him to keep the business going because it allows him to pay for his everyday needs and also save.  In the future, Isaac wants to offer auto-repair services and he's preparing to learn how to do it.  This is Isaac's first MFP loan.

Hoan has been in this business for over nine years and earns approximately 1,000,000 VND a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Hoan joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities.

Hoan plans to use the additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nHoan is the leader of a five member group receiving a loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

She is forty-four years old. Josephine is married and has three grown children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a service-based business, providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $65 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Josephine joined one of Kiva's field partners, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from GDMPC. Now Josephine is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. This is her fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She is married and has eight adult children. To make a living, Soloiluma raises crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Soloiluma has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nSoloiluma joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Soloiluma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers like manure. Soloiluma is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST, which will also be used to purchase fertilizers like manure. The loan will be the sixth taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Soloiluma plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 52 years old and single. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Rosalinda raises pigs for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty years and earns approximately $113 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rosalinda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP which will be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She is a very happy and hard working woman. She lives together with her husband and their youngest son Bryan, 13 years old. They are the reason for all of her efforts. She harvests carrots and gladiola flowers. This is Delia's daily work. With a great deal of effort she has managed to make her fields to be very productive, generating excellent quality harvests and very sought out by the wholesale market in the city of Tarma. Her favorite part of her work is caring of the plantations. She has had 15 years in the field. The most difficult part of the work is having to transport her products all the way to the city of Tarma. The sacks are very heavy. IN the future she hopes to have a stand in the wholesale market to improve her earnings. This is her seventh loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she will endeavor to be on time with her payments, not wanting to cause any troubles with her community bank, where she feels very content. With the thousand five hundred nuevos soles she requests, she will purchase pea seeds. This product is selling very well these months. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":596583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549376}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T18:09:34Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":233495,"name":"Depend On God Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatu F., who is holding the sign, is the leader of this group of five borrowers called Depend On God.

She gives manicures and does smocking detail on fabrics. \r\n\r\nAngeles joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $120, thus raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy materials for her smocking business so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business and for the education of her children.  Angeles M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family.  R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She will use her profits to revamp her salon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":914459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hair extensions and relaxers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Akodessewa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emefa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":30672},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":31132},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":31599},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":32073},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":32554},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33042},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33538},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34041},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":34552},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35070},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":35596},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":36131}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":133.07,"local_amount":62620,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:34:16Z","rounded_local_amount":64492.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250885617},{"amount":68,"local_amount":32000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":32957.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257295436},{"amount":69,"local_amount":32470,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":33441.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263630639},{"amount":70,"local_amount":32940,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-18T08:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33925.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270663589},{"amount":71.03,"local_amount":33425,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":34424.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276771887},{"amount":67.16,"local_amount":31605,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":32550.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283314342},{"amount":371.74,"local_amount":174940,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":180172.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287065165}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T18:33:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:23:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":360568,"name":"Mar","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Mar habite au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

Six years ago she started selling compact discs, movies, and music at the 16th of July fair. She is a member of Pro Mujer and a part of the Comunal Las Rosas Association. With her first loan, she purchased merchandise, like MP3 discs, that she sold at the city fairs. This allowed her to provide for her children, who were very young then, and to help her husband with the househould income. Currently, Carmen is the owner of 4 booths at the 16th of July fair where she sells DVD movies, MP3 music, etc. However, this business has a very short life span. This is why Carmen asks for a loan to invest capital in a new product and obtain a booth at the Huyustus market in the city of La Paz where she will sell computer accessories, recorders, as well as compact discs, disketes, and DVDs.

She started her business 15 years ago.  Her business is the production and sale of bread, which she sells in the mornings and her husband is in charge of in the afternoons.  She began selling in her house, then proposed to rent a house.  Her husband also works with her.  She has 4 children, one of which already has her own bakery thanks to Rosa's example as a businesswoman and support as a mother.  One of her daughters is a primary school teacher, and another works with her in the bakery, as they have a high demand for bread orders.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa wants a loan to be able to buy a dough mixing machine, which will help her to work better and without so much effort.  Also, with this machinery investment, she wants to take advantage of the end-of-year sales, which, thank God, increase.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Megan Tatman Montgomery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":211951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a machine for her bakery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Raymundo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.764722 -90.595556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T03:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T08:54:36Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":762.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5313271},{"amount":100.33,"local_amount":752.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:26:11Z","rounded_local_amount":764.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930918},{"amount":76.67,"local_amount":575,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":584.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14855544},{"amount":106.33,"local_amount":797.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":810.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395036},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":889.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086835},{"amount":161,"local_amount":1207.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1227.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980402},{"amount":176.5,"local_amount":1323.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1345.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52951740},{"amount":94.58,"local_amount":709.38,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-24T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":720.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169003},{"amount":159.96,"local_amount":1199.73,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-26T08:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1219.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594327},{"amount":100.31,"local_amount":752.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":764.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029797},{"amount":7.65,"local_amount":57.32,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-23T09:04:29Z","rounded_local_amount":58.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96941947}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T08:54:36Z","paid_date":"2009-12-23T09:04:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Megan Montgomery","image":165391}},{"id":72883,"name":"Mahammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahammad A. is 44 years old.

Sre Tachey in Kampong Chhnang province. To earn a living, she makes Khmer cake to sell to her customers. Her husband, Mr. Doet Soeung, is a motorbike taxi driver. In order to improve her family's living conditions, Mrs. Sakhorn K. would like to start a pig-breeding business; thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy three piglets for breeding purposes. She is 54 years old, and she is the mother of three children. Two of her children are soldiers, while her youngest child is currently attending the local school. <p>\r\n\r\nThis group loan is comprised primarily of end-of-term (\"EoT\") loans; indeed, three members are seeking such EoT loans, while the other member is requesting a loan whereby regular monthly loan payments are required. The EoT loan is AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor: it allows the borrower to repay portions of the principal whenever he or she is financially able to do so, meaning that the borrower is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan's term. Even so, most of AMK's clients start making their loan payments many months before the loan's maturity date. Further, nearly all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time; to illustrate, AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva-related loans.

We are a group of women who work in the marketing of processed seafood (dried fish, oysters, shrimp, and other dried seafood).  We buy the fresh product that we process (drying and smoking) and that we go to sell it at the weekly markets, which take place at different outlets in the region.  \r\n\r\nOur group wants to work with the women of the village by refurbishing our salt extraction equipment in order to make our production capacity more beneficial.  Among us, there are women who want to do commerce in grain products, which means several different businesses, but which means that our group may then work in solidarity to repay the loan.  The salt extraction group will have greater production, enabling it to export its product outside the region.  \r\n\r\nWe have chosen these businesses in order not to experience downtime.

Maria has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 400 tala a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Maria joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 tala from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers like manure. Maria is now requesting a new loan of 1000 tala, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Maria plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":382335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Gairatjon is 31 years old and is married with two children. He is a market vendor, selling animal fodder. The income generated is used mainly to purchase small bulls to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nNow, Gairatjon applies for a 5,000 Somoni loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 54 years old and married with three children who are between 31 and 34 years old, and have their own families. In spite of her children making their own way in life, Evelyn continues to strive to earn a living, not only for herself and her husband, but also because she wants to help her grandchildren have more opportunities.\r\n\r\nYears ago, Evelyn went into business to help her husband pay for the ever-increasing household expenses and to help with her children's school expenses. She started with a rice-retailing business, selling rice to people in her neighborhood and nearby villages, and this helped their family quite a lot. In 2004, with a pig-fattening business in mind, Evelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and went into what has turned out to be a good backyard venture for her and her family. Now, their small piggery business earns an average net profit of $88 a month.\r\n\r\nHer piggery business is doing quite well. In her previous loan she borrowed Php 17,000, which she used as additional capital for both her rice-retailing and her pig-fattening businesses. She was able to pay that loan off within its loan term without any delays. This time around she is borrowing another PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as working capital for her piggery.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is shown in the accompanying picture, posing in front of her backyard pigpens.\r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":422689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Additional

As the father of a family, he wants the best for his son. He has worked as the driver of a truck for the last two years, during which he has been able to make improvements to his home. When he started this job he drove a truck for hauling and was paid by commission, but now his wages are fixed. Even though he doesn\u2019t make much, it is enough for food, basic bills, and other expenses. With this loan he wants to able to properly close off his bathroom and latrine, which he has covered with pieces of tin and a curtain. This is uncomfortable, unsafe and not very hygienic, but he can\u2019t afford to put up concrete walls all at once. With the loans given to him by Afodenic he is making the improvements bit by bit. It is a great joy for him to be able to make the improvements which are a daily necessity for his family\u2019s hygiene. He will buy construction supplies such as stone, sand, cement and iron in order to complete the project. Only through this process can people of low income carry out these improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joseph Tobin, Kiva

Do\u00f1a Juanita gives food on credit to six police agents that they pay back at the end of the month.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":495663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy red meat and pork, chicken, vegetables, tortillas, drinks, butter, oil, plates, glasses and take out containers, juices, condiments, beans, sugar, rice, salsa, pasta","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T19:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010805},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136735177},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768634},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152086076},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2064.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799917},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166905058},{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1032.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172920}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T04:27:40Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly McKinnon","image":740438}},{"id":184349,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy is a fashion designer and she also sells sarongs and tailoring materials.

School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in a business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\n42-year-old Paul A. C. (right) is the deputy headmaster at the school.

Helen is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP that will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Helen from PMPC.

Mmasava is 38 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 20 years to support his family. In addition to this, Mmasava is very active in his community and involved in the savings and prayer groups. His harvest last year was not with One Acre Fund. He hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer, he will be able to join the ranks of the One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program! \r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be Mmasava\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He joined this year in order to learn new farming methods. As an active member in his community, Mmasava also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers. Mmasava plans on using profits from the harvest to save for the future. He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund. \r\n\r\nMmasava and the Bahati Group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests. One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers. Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.

Sarah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \"I have to do something for my family.\" \n\nSarah joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Sarah is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Sarah to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \n\nFor smallholder women in Kenya, accessing a financial solution is an uphill battle, but Sarah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are many because Sarah will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. As a result, her income will increase. \nSarah is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Sarah will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2039737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2346.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2485.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2558.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2633},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2709.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2789.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2870.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2954.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3040.9},{"due_date":"2016-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3129.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3221.24},{"due_date":"2016-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3315.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3412.27},{"due_date":"2017-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3512},{"due_date":"2017-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3614.64},{"due_date":"2017-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3720.27},{"due_date":"2017-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3829},{"due_date":"2017-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3940.92},{"due_date":"2017-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4056.08},{"due_date":"2017-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4174.69},{"due_date":"2017-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4296.62},{"due_date":"2017-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4422.19},{"due_date":"2017-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4551.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.1},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.41},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.3},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.21},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.12},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.12},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.15},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.2},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.41},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.56},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.75},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992404,"name":"Millicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ten years ago, Millicent started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Kerugoya, a remote town in Kenya.

They live in their own house thanks to an inheritance received from his grandfather.  Today the house is both his home and his workplace. Since he was very young he worked in carpentry working first as an employee.  Seeing the need, wanting to get ahead and being married with children, in 2002 his grandfather decided to support and invest in him and that is how he built his own carpentry business.  With his experience and hard work he was able to very quickly gain many customers.  Today, thanks to the income from his business he is able to afford the household expenses, his children's studies and to improve their quality of life.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is single with one child. She owns and operates a grocery shop, where she sells items like rice, sugar, vegetable oil, bottled water, body and hair creams, skimmed powdered milk, etc. She deems it a big opportunity to expand her business to include other items frequently demanded by customers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has worked in agriculture for more than thirty years, all fo which he has lived int he area, usually growing sugar cane, corn and yuca. Nowadays, twenty five days ago, he installed a hectare of corn in a plot of land close to where he lives. This business is not the only source of income on which he relies, he is conscious that the income that he receives from agriculture is seasonal, which is why he also makes a living in two activities outside of agriculture: beekeeping and the growing and sales of a type of guinea pigs, cuyes (edible mammals, native to the region). He possess some beehives on his plot of land, and cares for his animals in order to sell them to businessmen who usual visit the area where he lives. Tom\u00e1s wants to grow an additional hectare of corn, and furthermore to provide a good mantience of the crop that he already has in order to assure a good production. For this reason he has seen the need to ask Edpyme Alternativa, an affiliate of Kiva, for a loan of 1500 Soles to help him achieve his objective.

from Tanzania! Josephine is a forty-year-old widow with two children under the age of eighteen, and she also takes care of an orphan who is a relative. She runs a local Mama Lishe, or small caf\u00e9, with three employees to generate a monthly profit of 700 USD. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \"restaurant\" or \"caf\u00e9,\" you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. Josephine also works as a caterer for local businesses on an as-needed basis, which has helped her increase her monthly profit immensely. She is requesting 450 USD to purchase additional serving equipment to help fulfill her catering orders and extra cooking supplies such as rice and potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":191099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional supplies for her caf\u00e9","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T04:33:15Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":156330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347914},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970488},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886705},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435965},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130268},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027099},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613139},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010222}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T04:33:15Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":64709,"name":"Louk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Louk R., 35, is a farmer living in Siem Reap with her husband, Pi Pit, and their four children.

Since she was a girl, she has been dedicated to agricultural chores becuase she has never moved away from the land where she was born, which is where she still lives today. However, due to her old age, she has chosen to sell animals now, mainly pigs. Luzmila has two female pigs that are each four months pregnant; after a month or two, she will sell the piglets, obtaining a necessary earning. Every morning she goes out to cut the pasture so she can give the animals something to eat; this way feeding the animals is not a big expense. Luzmila recognizes that there are some risks in raising animals, such as if the newborn piglets died at a young age decreasing her earnings. Nevertheless, she continues working to improve her farm.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third time that Luzmila has accepted a loan form MFP, and she is very happy that the work she does in her community bank gives them an opportunity to keep a good united group.

With the requested money she will buy a special sewing machine (\"remalladora\") which costs 1200 soles and with the rest textile materiel (cloth, yarn, etc.)\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":303536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a sewing machine and material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T00:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":220.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":224.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":233.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":241.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":256.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":263.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":274.92},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":284.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.95},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.97},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.74,"local_amount":220.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":221.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012441},{"amount":72.95,"local_amount":224.46,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":225.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596030},{"amount":75.97,"local_amount":233.74,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":234.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990294},{"amount":78.52,"local_amount":241.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":242.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211419},{"amount":83.31,"local_amount":256.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":257.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640928},{"amount":85.8,"local_amount":263.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":265.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080395},{"amount":89.35,"local_amount":274.92,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:20Z","rounded_local_amount":276.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996578},{"amount":92.36,"local_amount":284.2,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":285.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842078}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T16:56:56Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"lene struck","image":881505}},{"id":105683,"name":"Afi","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme a ouvert une boulangerie dans son quartier \u00e0 agbal\u00e9p\u00e9do, elle vend du pain en gros, elle vend plus les matins parce que les matins les gens prennent leurs petits d\u00e9jeuners avec du pain.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a small producer in the city of Isfara in Tajikistan. Together with his wife they\u2019ve been raising cattle for more than fifteen years. This produces the income which allows him to feed his two children and his wife. As well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates agricultural crops such as wheat which helps with the family's diet and provides additional income.\r\n\r\nAbduahat has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the town of Sataoa C.  She has 11 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Tauala owns & operates a business venture.  The business operates in the agriculture sector.  The main purpose of the business is raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for S..  Tauala has been engaged in this business for over 6 years.  From these activities, Tauala earns approximately 500 WST a month.\n\nIn 2006, Tauala joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.   Taula had a previous loan loan from SPBD which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She is now requesting a loan of 1000 WST.  The current loan will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tauala plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a mother of one young child. She has established a computer business to help provide various types of reports and computer programs for members of her community and for different companies. She is a relatively new business owner. She started her business in 2007. She is requesting to borrow $1,000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase a new laptop and a router to better market her services and increase the liquidity of her business. And she\u2019s certain that with the new laptop, she will be able to deliver her reports and services faster. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

IV, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures. She sells decorations and she raises pigs for fattening. Her husband, Noel G., is 47 years old and works as a tricycle driver. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is 22 years old. Bebie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 27 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bebie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000 and improved the family's standard of living. This time, for her 28th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to purchase more inventory of decorations. She continues to save up for future business expansion. Bebie G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNancy operates a variety store, and as a sideline she is also raising a few hogs for slaughter. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for buying one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $4.60 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy a few more piglets to raise. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nNancy dreams of being able to stay physically, mentally and socially strong for her children. She also wants more pigs to raise and sell for meat. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She has a great wish to improve and equip her farm so she\u2019s going to become more adept at breeding guinea pigs as well as increase the size of her farm.\r\n\r\nShe is one of the clients with the longest credit history with MFP.  This is her 8th cycle and she expects to reach her objectives.  She will use the requested money to hire workmen to dig furrows and plant alfalfa as well as to buy feed for the guinea pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":819372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers and buy guine pig feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-23T17:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.3},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.29},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":255.1},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.81},{"due_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":278.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.78,"local_amount":220.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":221,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350767},{"amount":85.38,"local_amount":232.86,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":233.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851131},{"amount":89.94,"local_amount":245.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":246.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666308},{"amount":93.54,"local_amount":255.1,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":255.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621466},{"amount":98.2,"local_amount":267.81,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:25Z","rounded_local_amount":268.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835539},{"amount":102.16,"local_amount":278.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":279.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246359}],"funded_date":"2011-07-25T02:19:02Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":323703,"name":"Agustino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agustino is 49 years old, married to Caroline and together they have four school-going children.

from Tanzania! Asha is a 39-year-old divorcee with three children, all of whom are in school. She owns and operates a store that sells phone accessories such as mobile phone cases, phone docks, chargers and so on. Despite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country (forgive the label, there remains no consensus on an acceptable definition), it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general. Not just professionals, but grandmothers in villages, school kids, street sellers. It can probably be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that mobile phones are the only form of phone communication available to most people because there are few land lines, and followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here. \r\n<p>Due to the widespread demand for mobile phones as well as the enterprising attitude of Asha and her two employees, Asha makes a monthly profit of approximately $US100. She is requesting a loan of $275 in order to purchase additional phone accessories to be able to earn more profits. In the future, she hopes to be able to expand her business.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

San Francisco North, Tibiao Antique, Philippines.  She finished her Bachelor of Science in Education and practiced her profession for almost 5 years. Unfortunately she did not continue teaching when she was separated from her husband because there was a third party involved with their relationship on her husband's side.  She now stands as a mother and a father for her six children.  \r\n\r\nBeing a single mother, many challenges and trials come into her life. One of these is a financial problem concerning the medical treatment for her son, who suffers from drug abuse.  She recalls those years when she baked bread and cooked dishes to sell in their neighborhood just to earn income to meet the basic needs of her family.  \r\n\r\nThose past experiences have made her become firm in the face of challenges.  Besides, despite being a single mom, she established her 5 children and sent them to school to finish college, and recently they have stable jobs. Being a responsible mother she felt her responsibilities for her children. Currently she wants to have working capital for her own business and not depend on them.  \r\n\r\nShe is hoping that someday she will be able to start up a restaurant or refreshment stand because she is a good cook but she lacks opportunities because of having no capital.  If she is given a chance and if somebody like ASHI is willing to grant her working capital of Php 10,000 to start with, she will do her best to expand her business and to show her integrity.

With respect to their capabilities, it may be said that they are all conscientious and the loan is granted to improve their businesses with the purchase of merchandise, such as the materials and tools necessary in order to increase their income and thus give their families a better quality of life.  The members have experience with solidarity groups since most of the members are working on their second cycle while demonstrating punctuality and responsibility with their payments.<br

Gomez is a native of Sabanalarga, a place where they say \"intelligence is endemic.\"  He has a fruit stand where he also offers calling services and sells lottery tickets.  It is located in a public place very close to a bus terminal, and the business is going very well because there are constantly people who are traveling and inter-departmental (long-distance) buses that are arriving.  Their passengers buy the delicious fruit to start their trip with and make calls through an operator, and they also buy lottery tickets, dreaming that some day they will become millionaires or have a few more pesos that they can enjoy.\r\n\r\nHis life has changed a lot, and he says that it changed 360 degrees since he became involved with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and got his first loan, which he was not able to do with any other institution.  This Kiva loan is his 5th loan; he wants to buy fruit at wholesale which he will turn around and distribute to other traders, and he also wants to make some improvements to his kitchen.\r\n\r\nGumercindo is a hardworking man and an exemplary father.  He began in the business that his father taught him; he was selling lottery tickets from the time he was 17 years old.  For some time this was his main activity and source of income.  Sometime later he worked selling newspapers.  He had assistants who did not bring back the money that he had to pay the company, which he had to deposit daily.  But this did not cause him to lose his enthusiasm to continue working and dedicate himself to his business.  Through the business he managed to educate his children and today some of them are working in companies in the city and others work in commercial activities with the advice of their father.  As he has been a good saver, he bought a lot with his earnings and built his house in the Carrizal neighborhood, thanks to his sacrifice and his will to get ahead with his family.  For this reason, he now feels content and will continue to work to further improve his income and his standard of living.\r\n

Realiza esta actividad desde hace 05 a\u00f1os en un puesto del centro de su comunidad. Conoce a la perfecci\u00f3n el rubro y cuenta con clientela ya establecida en la zona. Con sus ingresos, Mar\u00eda puede ayudar a su esposo, quien se dedica a la agricultura, con el sostenimiento econ\u00f3mico de su familia. Mar\u00eda solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de m\u00e1s insumos para utilizar en la preparaci\u00f3n de su champu, comida y refrescos. Por ello, ha cre\u00eddo conveniente solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo de 800 nuevos soles de Edpyme Alternativa.\n","en":"Maria is 55 years old, and is married with one child. She lives in her own house in a rural part of the Lambayeque district in the north of Peru. Maria works selling soft drinks and hamburgers as well as champu, a traditional delicacy of corn, sugar, and fruit. She has been pursuing this activity for five years in a stall in the center of her community. She knows the zone perfectly and has many established clients in the area. With her income, Maria can help her husband, who works in agriculture, with sustaining the family economically. Maria is asking for the loan to purchase more supplies to prepare the champu, as well as for the purchase of food and soft drinks. This is why she has thought it convenient to ask for a loan for 800 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa.

Maota needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase weed killers such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maota joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Maota's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\". For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

At 44 years of age, she is a single mother who has known how to give her daughter Maria, 22 years old, a good profession.  Together, they work to improve their standard of living.  With a good eye, Haidee dedicates herself to selling seasonal products and she has a great feel for knowing what will be in greatest demand by people.  Currently, she is distributing products throughout the stalls at the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  Her offerings include summer clothing brought all the way from the country of Bolivia, as she wants to take advantage of the intense heat that the city experiences. The most difficult part of Hailee\u2019s work is knowing what products would be good to sell, yet she still enjoys taking her novelties to the stands that buy her products.  She has been doing this activity for 13 years.  She yearns to have her own store to sell the products she brings from other parts of the country, as well as from overseas, herself.  This is Haidee\u2019s fourth loan with MFP, and she has repaid her previous loans in a timely manner.  She hopes to pay this latest loan on time as well.  She is very active in her cooperative bank, and she always has advice to share with other members.  With the 800.00 Peruvian soles that she is requesting, she will buy articles for the carnival season, including costume masks so the people can dress up and enjoy themselves.  In addition, she will bring clothing of Pepino (a traditional clown of dances of the Andean plains), which she says will be her most popular items during these carnivals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":272799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T01:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haidee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117086},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011999},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595584},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989846},{"amount":41.56,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":134.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210982},{"amount":42.2,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":136.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640483}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T02:22:08Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":93427,"name":"Jose Leonel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Leonel tiene la edad de 38 a\u00f1os, habita en el kil\u00f3metro. 11 \u00bd carretera a Masaya entrada Esqu\u00edpulas, todav\u00eda no es casado vive con su mam\u00e1 y trabaja como Administrador de cybernik, los sue\u00f1os de don Jos\u00e9 es llegar a tener su propio negocio y lograr mejorar la casa de su mam\u00e1 ya que en un futuro piensa casarse y formar una familia .La mayor necesidad que tiene es la falta de financiamiento, ya que lo que el gana aporta parte para la casa y sus propios gastos.
