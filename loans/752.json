He lives with his parents: Alejo, age 64, and Lucila, age 65. They live in a cozy home in the Peruvian mountain range.\r\nThe love that he feels for the land of his birth compelled him into agriculture 4 years ago, and thanks to the sowing of potatoes, peas, and gladiolas, he has been able to finish his professional studies and meet his parents' expenses.\r\nOne advantage of his work is being able to meet wholesalers who pay him fairly for his products. He also likes everything about agriculture except for having to pay for contracted workers. Because of this, his future plans include joining with someone who wants to work at large-scale planting. Additionally, as he studied pharmacology he wants to have a pharmacy in order to help his neighbors since he enjoys being supportive.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan through MFP, and he is positive that he will make his repayments on time. Also, he appreciates and is happy working with the people in his community bank because he has practically grown up with them. With the money that he is now requesting, he plans to buy a bag of pea seeds so he can take advantage of the planting season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":476421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T03:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":570,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672819}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T06:04:14Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Merchlewitz","image":188300}},{"id":175396,"name":"Angela Del Rosario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c1ngela Del Rosario tiene 61 a\u00f1os, por lo que su actividad econ\u00f3mica es una pulper\u00eda.

Judit thinks of being a big wholesaler, but feels that he doesn't have everything that he needs to get started, and he remembers what it has cost him to be a good businessman. But he owes all that he has achieved to his parents. Not content with the current success of his business, Judit, along with his wife, decided to open a grocery store with the goal of having a competitive advantage over the rest, and this is going well. Judit usually takes sole care of sowing his crops, but can also count on laborers to help him with his work.  His wife works as a partner in the grocery store. They generally sell their products in their community. For the future, Judit plans to expand his grocery store and introduce new natural products, in accordance with the economic means of his customers. This is his fourth loan from MFP, and he promises to meet his obligations. He is also grateful for the confidence that is offered to his community group. He will use the loan to buy a greater quantity of merchandise with the goal of stocking his grocery store and bringing in a greater profit. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":539494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a greater quantity of merchandise to supply her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-15T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judit ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886413}],"funded_date":"2010-06-12T00:08:51Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":204509,"name":"Brunilda Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Brunilda del Carmen C.

T., a 23-year-old pepper producer and mother of three, lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. Mar\u00eda is a dedicated mother and producer. She plans to focus her efforts on the planting and harvest of Tabasco peppers. Mar\u00eda works in cooperation with her family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. Mar\u00eda\u00b4s husband works at a local orange-producing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement the family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and to buy food. The rural zone where Mar\u00eda and her family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water. The family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Mar\u00eda is working hard towards the sustenance of her family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from her land and labor.\r\n \r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Mar\u00eda and her family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of tabasco peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All laborial and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Mar\u00eda with the help of her family members in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles, located in the Northern Region of Costa Rica. Mar\u00eda will need roughly one year before her peppers will reach maturity and be ready for harvest.\r\n \r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the morning, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking, cleaning and caring for younger siblings. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvest and planting, working the land as needed. \r\n\r\nThe main factor that has stood in the way of increasing her production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services. \r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Mar\u00eda, her family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital, and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Mar\u00eda wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. She wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in her neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":556292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seedlings and nutrients necessary for the production of peppers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-06-18T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":545000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":87122.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":88574.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90050.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":91551.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":93077.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":94622.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":163.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.19},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.05},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":168.51,"local_amount":89600.01,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":89935.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411585},{"amount":665,"local_amount":353583.29,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":354908.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551342},{"amount":191.49,"local_amount":101816.7,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":102198.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970510}],"funded_date":"2010-06-19T03:56:14Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":212702,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Ali Sangar\u00e9 est une homme mari\u00e9 de 36 et p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant.

She has already received and successfully repaid 4 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the inventory of her store.  In the future, Hasina plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called a 'pasal', is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical 'pasal' might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

She shares two rooms with her five children at Musang, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nMargaret has had great difficulties in life ranging from ill-health, the untimely death of relatives, failure to attain a quality education and inadequate capital. Amongst other challenges, she needs more capital to be able to carry on with her projects. With this loan, she plans to buy food items such as rice, beans & corn, which she will sell and make more profit. She thinks her business is an influential one and she has succeeded over the past years. She, as well, regularly undertakes contracts. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford good food items at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nShe will invest some of her profits into her business and use the rest to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to pay for her children's education and to upgrade her standard of living. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":595943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, corn, salt and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

Her husband works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They live in 109, Brgy. Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. Mary Jane earns her living by buying and selling charcoal and rice.  Mary Jane joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Jane has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  9,000  PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,200 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  For her fifth loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stocks of charcoal, rice, and rice bran for the pigs so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children. Mary Jane is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His father works as a butcher.\r\n\r\nKhumidin buys cattle from Kurgantyube, Yavan, Jomi and Khuroson markets.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She sold her goods in Soledad and Barranquilla in the department of Atl\u00e1ntico.  Since Diana is a very active woman who wants to get ahead, she began to put together her own working capital little by little.   With the help of her husband she now distributes canned goods, groceries, cosmetics, informal clothing and ladies' dresses that she sews herself.  Her main customers are store-owners and families in the different neighborhoods of the southwest and south of the city of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nThrough her business she is the main source of income and, together with her husband's income, they are able to take care of household expenses and care for their children, ages 2 and 7, who they want to see grow up and be successfull.  This is their main purpose.\r\n\r\nThe CrediKiva loan is Diana's first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

businesses than men. There are a number of reasons, like fear of risk and lack of knowledge about managing a business. However, Orazkhan is not among those people. \r\n\r\nOrazkhan, 42, is the leader of this group. She knows that a good business should be profitable, both for her and society. Four years ago, while breeding and reselling cattle which brought only intermittent income, she decided to start another type of profitable business \u2013 a chicken farm. With an initial startup capital of 6,000 soms, Orazkhan purchased 60 productive chickens. After two months of keeping the poultry in warm and sanitized conditions, the hens reached a state of giving at least two eggs a day each. Besides distributing eggs to her neighbors at market price, Orazkhan usually has more left for her family\u2019s consumption. The business helps her provide her family with nutritious food like chicken and diversify the menu. Throughout these four years, Orazkhan has been making 6,000 - 7,000 soms income per month, which is quite enough to help her husband and their daughter. The loan requested by Orazkhan will be invested into development of the business and buying more chickens. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young and ambitious socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 <i>People<\/i> (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), <i>Planet<\/i> (keeping environmentally friendly) and <i>Profit<\/i> (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It is known for the beautiful beaches that surround this pretty area and that are visited by Ecuadoran tourists and foreigners alike.  It is known by the name \u201cCrucita la Bella\u201d (Crucita the Beautiful).\r\n\r\nThis is the place where we meet Se\u00f1ora Laura.  She is 46 years old, married and with her husband had four children.  Three of their children are grown.  The youngest is 13 years old and goes to school.  Three of her children still live with her.  Her husband makes his living as a fisherman.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Laura is a homemaker who takes care of the loans to help her husband.  He makes his living fishing and selling the fruits of the sea.  He works every day.  Some days, he and the other fisherman don't go out to sea until late in the day and then don't come back until the following morning.  There our friend waits for him to disembark to begin her work cleaning the fish.  They then sell the fish to the tradesmen who come to the beach.

She raises and fatten pig in her yards to support her family's income.  From her farm income, she managed to afford high school tuition for her 3 children that now can support themselves independently.  She pays so much attention on her 2 pigs that she is growing, so that the 2 piglets she purchsed for $50 can now be sold for $100, the net profit of about $35 can be used to afford the ever increasing living expenses.  Ni Ketut is also thinking of her old age, when she will not be as productive as she is now.  Ni Ketut plans to improve her farming techniques and expand her farm by adding more pigs.  She also needs more money to pay for feeds that are becoming more expensive.

Walaupun sebagai wanita  biasa, tetapi Ni Ketut Suarmi tidak mau tinggal diam saja melihat suami bekerja keras untuk menghidupi keluarga. Ni Ketut Suarmi ikut ambil bagian dalam mengusahakan kesejahteraan keluarganya dengan memelihara babi penggemukan di sekitar pekarangan rumahnya. Karena keuletannya, Ni Ketut Suarmi mampu menyekolahkan 3 orang anaknya sampai mereka tamat pendidikan menengah dan akhirnya bisa bekerja untuk mencukupi  kebutuhan hidupnya masing-masing. 2 ekor babi penggemukan yang dipeliharanya diperhatikannya dengan sangat baik sehingga dari dua ekor bibit yang dibelinya dengan harga Rp 450.000 dalam waktu 2,5 bulan mampu dijual dengan seharga Rp 900.000 dan keuntungan bersih yang diperolehnya sekitar Rp   300.000 dan itu dipakai untuk menutupi biaya hidup yang semakin tinggi. Ni Ketut Suarmi juga memikirkan hari tuanya yang tentu saja tidak bisa seproduktif seperti sekarang, sehingga Ni Ketut Suarmi pun berusaha keras untuk mengelola usahanya dengan baik  yaitu dengan berencana menambah jumlah ternak yang dipelihara serta  menyediakan stok pakan yang memadai karena harga pakan sudah semakin mahal. Dengan menjalin kerjasama dengan DINARI lewat pinjaman modal usaha, Ni Ketut Suarmi  melihat peluang untuk mengembangkan usahanya untuk mendapat hasil yang maksimal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":82260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She recently came to Esperanza International (Kiva's Field Partner) to seek a loan so she could start her own small business and start earning an income. She plans on selling small food products in her area, such as rice, salt, bread, and other small items. She is confident in herself that she can grow her business and hopes to someday have her own grocery story. She said she wants nothing more than to provide a good life for her kids because she loves them more than anything else.

Red Light in Paynesville, Liberia.  Red Light is the country's largest market, and is about 10 kilometers from the capital Monrovia.  It is a bustling area full of shops, stalls, and vendor tables.\r\n\r\nOretha is 35 years old and is engaged to be married -- \"I pray to God it will be soon,\" Oretha says of her wedding.  She has four children, two girls and two boys, and also takes care of her mother.  All of her children are in school now; the oldest, a boy, is 20 and in the 11th grade, and the youngest, a 12-year-old girl, is in the 5th grade.\r\n\r\nMany Liberians had their schooling interrupted by years of civil war and conflict, but now that peace has come they are returning to school to finish their studies.  Oretha herself has only been able to complete the 6th grade, and she has no plans to return to school at this time.\r\n\r\nOretha started her business selling lapa, lace, and linen in 2002.  Lapa is patterned, printed African fabric; Oretha is wearing a dress made of lapa in the photo that accompanies this profile.  She says most of the lapa she buys and resells is imported from Togo. She sells from a table at the Red Light market.  Most of her customers are women, but men also buy the lapa she sells.  She says of her business:  \"I take care of it and manage it well.\"  Oretha plans to use her 8,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 37,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more lapa and lace.  \r\n\r\nOretha hopes to be able to grow her business enough so that she can open a proper storefront at the Red Light market.  She also wants to be able to help her children finish their education, \"so they can help me in my old age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Oretha is the one holding the sign.

This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying supplies and other materials for their landscaping needs.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":556368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buying

Right now his repair shop has two employees so not only does Javier`family depend on the repair shop, but two other families also depend on the repair shop`s income.\r\n\r\nHe needs $475.00 USD to buy material and tools that will enable him to improve the time and quality of his work; in this way he hopes his clientele increases and more income is generated. Javier plans to return the loan between 3 to 6 months.  He requests your support and kindness.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Alison Rives, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJavier es una persona joven, responsable y trabajadora, su negocio consiste en el servicio de enderezado y pintura de carros; inicio este negocio ante la necesidad de tener un empleo ya que el \u00faltimo empleo que hab\u00eda tenido lo hab\u00eda perdido por lo que decidi\u00f3 iniciar su propio negocio.

Little by little he has increased his income until today he is able to meet his spending and pay for his children's education.<p>\r\nMartin is now asking for a $400 loan which he will repay in 6 months to purchase material.

With the loan money she is going to buy a case of cigarettes valued at 1200 soles, which will be sufficient to stock her supply and the rest of the money will be used for unforeseen expenses. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":258998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-21T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:42Z","rounded_local_amount":252.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423662},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":252.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116931},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":252.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011852},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":252.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595446},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":252.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989692},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":252.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210813}],"funded_date":"2009-01-21T04:11:08Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":88975,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bertha es socia del Banco Comunal Estrella.\nBertha es casada, tiene 29 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Bertha vende condimentos al por mayor, sus ventas los realiza en la ciudad de Huanta a donde viaja 2 veces por semana, sus productos los adquiere en la ciudad de Lima.\nBertha necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de ajo por sacos.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Bertha son terminar de construir su casa, comprar un carro para transportar sus productos.\n","en":"Bertha is a member of the Estrella (Star) communal bank.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, its culture is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and its manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 29 years old and has been married to Sra. Lida Vera Lopez for more than 10 years.  Both are involved in raw milk production, but Sr. Rimy also works as in his spare time as a mechanic at his uncle\u2019s repair shop.  Although he does not have children, Sr. Rimy wants to make sure his family is financially stable so that they don\u2019t suffer due to a lack of money.\r\n<p>\r\nSr. Rimy lives in the area of Central Maica in Cochabamba.  Two years ago, his family managed to raise enough money to build a house on the land that his father gave him as part of his inheritance.  Although the house is not big, it has all the amenities he needs and gives him great pride.  He currently owns three dairy cows that produce milk, which is later sold to a vendor who makes all types of dairy products.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase an additional dairy cow.  Not only will this increase his herd, but it will also increase milk production and improve his income.  This is the second loan Sr. Rimy has received from our Institution and the responsibility he demonstrated previously enabled him to be considered for another loan.  In the future, he hopes to receive a third loan so that he can improve his house and his family\u2019s quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

They all live in the San Joaquin neighborhood, which is a very pretty part of the city of Cuenca.  The majority of the population in this area works in agriculture and also in the sale of foods such as grilled meats and canelazos ( a hot drink made of sugar cane liquor, and cinnamon.)  \r\n\r\nRosario C. is a member of this communal bank.  She enjoys a great friendship with all of her friends and colleagues in the communal bank.  She has been taking loans from the foundation for 4 years.  The loan representatives from the foundation inspired her to work with the foundation and take advantage of the benefits that it offers. She tells us that the loans have helped her to increase her business, little by little, allowing both her business and her family to see improvements.  She has had a snack bar in a school for 2 years, and it is going well.  She works from 7am until 1pm from Mondays through Fridays.  Rosario lives by the city of Cuenca in the Cristo de Consuelo neighborhood.  She is 51 years old, married, and her husband works as a sales manager for a company.  They have 4 children aged 29, 28, 22 and 13 years of age.  Her oldest daughter is a professional and has a laboratory clinic.  Her second and third children are married and live independently with their families.  Her youngest son studies at the Unedid school.  She feels proud that through the fruits of her efforts she is able to have her own house.  With the new loan from the foundation, she will buy products for her snack bar such as potato snacks, soft drinks, bolos (juice in a plastic sleeve), ice cream, lollipops, etc.  Her goal is to continue to grow with her business and in this way give her best to her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":465554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"potato snacks, bolos (frozen juice in packets), ice cream, lollipops, soft drinks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-07T23:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":440,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122.73,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":122.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074672},{"amount":76.7,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":76.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910657},{"amount":25.59,"local_amount":25.02,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946297},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946298},{"amount":37.51,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":37.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674622},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674623},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674624},{"amount":37.51,"local_amount":36.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":37.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708812},{"amount":37.46,"local_amount":36.63,"processed_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":37.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892124}],"funded_date":"2010-01-10T02:48:26Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":171209,"name":"Amparo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amparo A. has been married for 24 years.

The children are the driving force and the motivation for her effort and sacrifice in order to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the Mujeres Fuertes y Unidas group.  It is comprised of nine other members.  They live in the San Agustin area in the Comas district.  \r\n\r\nHercilia Anita works all day in her bookstore and bazaar.  Five years ago she set up a small bookstore in order to be able to take care of her children at home.  The store was growing little by little until she converted it into the bookstore and bazaar that it now is.  \r\n\r\nWith her business she is able to support her daughters with their expenses, which range from registration fees to school materials.  That way she makes an important contribution in maintaining her household.  She also enables her children to move ahead toward a profession.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy supplies and some gift items to stock her business.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":547317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Comas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-06-12T07:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hercilia Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Miryan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Lourdes Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2275},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2275},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2275},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1587.5,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4551.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617167},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2275,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2275.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831502},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2275,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2275.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098043}],"funded_date":"2010-07-06T18:50:51Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":208637,"name":"Anastasia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anastasia M.

A. is from the village of Sinian Baliangao Misamis Occ..

Honey has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2,800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Honey joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Honey has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Honey is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Honey from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She lives together with her husband Emilio and their young son in the community of Cumutay. Since she was very young she has been involved in agriculture and currently she plants peas together with her partner. She says that the work is somewhat difficult especially because her days have to start very early in the morning to be able to diligently oversee the cultivation. But she gains strength in known that the reward for all of her effort is a good harvest, which is obtained when the products are ready to be collected. At that time she hires farmhands (workers) to help her get the heavy sacks ready for sale to the wholesalers in the city. The earnings which she will obtain from the sale of her natural products are steady and it is the reason why she is able to offer her family a good quality of life.

She currently lives in the San Martin region of the Bellasvista province and district, and works selling chickens prepared for cooking. Her business is located in the Jr. Puno on the 4th floor, where every day she receives many customers. She sends chickens to stores and to chicken roasters - selling to most on the weekends. Since she started her business, Liliana has changed her commercial activities. In the beginning she sold groceries. When that didn't work out well for her, she switched to chickens. She has received help from her husband, and through that she has experienced economic growth. With this loan of 500 soles, which she will repay in 4 months, Liliana will purchase chickens for later sale so that she can offer her product to different stores and chicken roasters around the city.

The rest of her loan will be invested in purchasing cooking oil. This is one of the most expensive items used for cooking, so it's better purchased in large quantities (a 5 gallon can). Estela will also buy some seasonal fruits and vegetables to cover the demand of those people who make their own food but buy materials from the stand. She hopes that catering to a variety of clients will render her profits that one day will allow her to have her own house.

Chanthou N. is a villager in Mea Neak village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a 7-hectare field to cultivate rice for a living. On this farm, she faces a problem because she does not have enough equipment to plow the field so she decided to ask for a loan to buy an electric cow to plow the field.

in 1959 in Khdrants village, there he graduated from Agarak village high school and then enrolled in and graduated from Kapan Vocational School.  Emin is a lathe operator by profession.  Emin is married and has a son and two daughters.  The son is married and lives separately from the parents.  The daughters are also married and each lives separately from the parents with her family.  Emin's wife helps him a lot with managing the household.  Emin works as a forester in the Kapan forest.  \n\nIn addition to working in his profession Emin has also been working in agriculture since 1994 in Khdrants village.  He owns livestock, chickens, pigs, bees and a garden where he grows vegetables.  Emin also has a plot of land where he diligently grows wheat.  He has regular customers in Kapan city who purchase vegetables that he grows as well as beef, pork, honey, eggs and milk.  Since a forester's salary is low the earnings from the sale of agricultural products help Emin to support his family and also to help the families of his children. Emin needs a loan of 600,000 dram for planting (purchase a new variety of grain, diesel fuel), which will significantly improve the performance of his agricultural products.

He always said his wife cooked better and that\u2019s how she got them to hire her for an event.  That\u2019s how it took off and she became known.  She started in this business with her good seasoning and the help of her mother.  She made her own personal cards offering her services to every person she knew.  She advertised herself  and the results were good because they began calling her from all over.  They hire her for birthday parties, anniversaries, events, etc.\r\nIn the summer she also helps herself because she gets contracts from families for their summer houses.  She makes a good profit for this.  She also sells Herbalife products.  All these jobs help her cover her needs and those of her 2 children.  She is separated and she supports them herself.  Marisol likes cooking a lot and she feels happy.  She is already thinking of opening her own restaurant in the future where she could wait on all her customers.  What she is doing now is temporary.  She wants something safe and stable.  She knows that she\u2019ll have her children\u2019s and EDAPROSPO\u2019s help con this project.  She\u2019s thankful for the organization because she has achieved a lot of things.  She\u2019ll use her current loan to buy Herbalife products because she has many products to deliver to her customers.\r\n*Mrs. Marisol F. is the one with the gray shirt.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":450691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"PURCHASE HERBALIFE PRODUCTS","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T22:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora De Los Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yude Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor De Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Milagros Ursula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1675},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1675},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1675},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064609},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899668},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933751},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661347}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T04:55:00Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":167117,"name":"Sandra Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sandra es cliente nueva, se dedica a la elaboracion de tarjetas de navidad y un sin fin de adornos utilizando goma eva, pintura, escarcha y cartulina, esta actividad no solo la realiza por la epoca de navidad sino tambien para fiestas infantiles y otros acontecimientos, en realidad esta actividad la realiza todo el a\u00f1o con distintas actividades.

Freddy plans to use part of the funds for vehicle maintenance and part for his driver's licence renewal so that he can continue to drive problem-free.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":487200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"For vehicle service and maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T00:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993219},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718002},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751678},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934143},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672918},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886702},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153806},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449205}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T03:58:55Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":179782,"name":"Ren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ren U. is a 29 year-old married woman who lives in Prey Run village in Takeo province.

She is 33 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rona owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $88 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rona is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI.

This area is characterized by its distressed ecology. Due to lack of opportunities, he started working in a bakery at a young age to make his own income. When he grew up, he decided that this would be his main job. He bought a small oven and started to make bread and sell it throughout the area. He now makes breads and red donuts from flour (pictured in the photo) for his customers from 8:00 until nightfall. In order to continue with his business and speed up his production, he wants to purchase machines with his loan. In the future he wants to finish building his home, which is currently made of bamboo.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva

The group is made up of four women who know one another and are neighbors. They are:\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes C. V. - she will use her loan to buy jugs of purified water to stock her business;\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Magdalena F. M. - she will buy earrings and bracelets to stock her business;\r\n\r\nMs. Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez Hern\u00e1ndez - she will buy sandals, shoes, sneakers, and cowboy boots to stock her business; and\r\n\r\nMs. Rosa F. God\u00ednez - she will buy <i>jitomates<\/i>, onions, tomatoes, chilies, lettuce, and fruits to stock her business.\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes C. V. is 42 years old. She studied one year of primary school. She lives in a common-law marriage and has three sons: Miguel, 25, is married and works; Aurelia, 24, went to work in the United States; and Martha Patricia, 23, went to work in the United States.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has a business grinding <i>nixtamal<\/i> [dried corn] and selling dough, jugs of purified water, and soft drinks. She is requesting this loan to buy jugs of purified water, corn, and cases of soft drinks. Her business is called \"Molina El Rey\" [\"The King's Mill\"]. She offers her clients milling services and she sells jugs of purified water and soft drinks. She started her business 20 years ago because there wasn't anyone selling goods there, since  it was a new settlement. She started by selling purified water and soft drinks, and a year ago, her husband bought the mill so they could start the business of selling dough and grinding nixtamal or chilies for <i>mole<\/i> [a traditional Mexican stew or soup]. Her brother-in-law and her son, who work in a tortilla factory fixing the machines, taught her how to use the mill. Her brother-in-law got the mill for her and although it is small, she was able to start her business with savings from a time when she had gone to Cuernavaca.\r\n\r\nIt was her husband who gave her the idea to sell goods. They bought merchandise with money they had earned previously. The business is located in their house and it is important because it brings in money for food. Mar\u00eda's husband helps her to stock her business and to bring things, as well as to grind and deliver the corn. Her favorite part of her business is milling and selling dough. She is proud that her mill grinds well, and it is small and pretty. \r\n\r\nHer customers are her neighbors. Her business is popular because their town is small and hers is the only mill. She keeps her earnings so that if the mill breaks she can buy parts, and she also uses them to pay for electricity. She is planning to expand her business by selling sodas, and on Saturdays and Sundays she will sell <i>pozole<\/i>, crispy tortillas, and tacos. She would also like to start a small grocery store and she thinks she will be able to achieve this with her loan.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business, along with her husband's income and the money her children send, has helped her family to eat. Sometimes, when her husband is without work, he fetches the tortillas, eggs, or whatever else.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes to make the following improvements to her home: flatten the ground and install a floor. Her hopes and plans are to see her grandchildren grow up and for them to have a better life; and for her children to not suffer and to be in good health.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda de Lourdes is excited about this loan because she will use it to invest. She is also nervous because sometimes she doesn't have enough money, but with God's help she is going to move forward with her business. The improvements she hopes to make in the future are as follows: to leave her children something, to expand her business, and for her children to keep working.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you for having faith in us. Thank you because we will now invest in our businesses and we hope that you will continue supporting us.\"\r\n\r\nAnenecuilco is a calm, tranquil village with a view of the hills. It is home to the Emiliano Zapata Museum, since it is where he was born. It holds some of his writings and belongings that he used, and it shows a movie about the history of General Emiliano Zapata, whose motto was: \u201cThe land belongs to those who work it.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":717393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy jugs of purified water, corn, and cases of soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ANENECUILCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-04T08:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6808.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292477},{"amount":375,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4538.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160735},{"amount":432.07,"local_amount":5184.89,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5229.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233609},{"amount":130.43,"local_amount":1565.11,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1578.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512433}],"funded_date":"2011-03-06T16:53:12Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":282428,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma N. has operated a clothes-selling business for four years, and she works seven days a week.

is a young man who is 32 years old.

He was able to purchase the clothing from other vendors at a lower price, and then turn a small profit. He would also sell this clothing door-to-door, and as he did so, he realized that he could learn to tailor clothing himself. To perfect his skills, he traveled to the capitol. When he returned to his native city Pucallpa and with the help of his wife, he set up a modest shop where he began working doing what he enjoyed most. He was then able to partner with one of his aunts to open a clothing sales and tailoring stand in a commercial center located on a major avenue of the city. Thanks to his knowledge and experience tailoring clothes, his business has improved. Nevertheless, there are orders, which he falls behind on for lack of cloth and material. Because of this, Jhon is requesting a $200 loan, which he has agreed to repay in 6 months. He will use the money to purchase material and supplies to meet the demands of his business, so that he can reach his goal of having his own stand as soon as possible and meet the needs of his home.  <p> <b>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nJhon es un joven de 32 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa y un peque\u00f1o ni\u00f1o  que est\u00e1 estudiando, \u00e9l empez\u00f3 vendiendo en la calle  prendas que adquir\u00eda tambi\u00e9n de otros comerciantes a menor precio con el fin de tener una peque\u00f1a ganancia, tambi\u00e9n iba  ofreciendo estas prendas caminando y tocando puertas, con el pasar del tiempo se di\u00f3 cuenta que el pod\u00eda aprender a confeccionar las ropas que vend\u00eda y para hacerlo  tuvo que viajar a la capital a perfeccionar su idea. \r\n\r\nCuando retorn\u00f3 a su ciudad natal Pucallpa puso un peque\u00f1o y modesto taller empezando a trabajar en lo que m\u00e1s le gusta con la ayuda de su esposa y lograron asociarse con una de sus  t\u00edas para poner un stand de venta y confecci\u00f3n de ropas en un centro comercial  ubicado en una importante  avenida de esta ciudad.Gracias a los conocimientos  y experiencia en la confecci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir, el negocio est\u00e1 mejorando sin embargo hay pedidos que son entregados con un leve retraso por  falta de telas y materiales.

She is a native of the city of Juliaca.  She is single and lives in the house of some relatives.  Since she finished high school and did not have opportunities to continue with higher education, she decided to work.  Therefore, four years ago she set up a book store, where she offers folders, pens, books, etc.  The business is going well, precisely because of the dedication Katerin gives it, opening from 8 in the morning and staying until 9 or 10 in the evening to be able to earn the income she wants.  The hardest part for her is to have to spend all day tending to her business, since she has to put off other activities.

Katerin wants to be an independent woman who does not need anyone to be happy and achieve all of her goals.

Twelve years ago, she owned a kiosk and sold candy, coffee and bread and then decided to sell used clothes as a street vendor and it is going well.  She currently performs this activity, but for the last 2-years she also runs a small shop out of her house and that too is going well and is very profitable. Now, Ciria has it in mind to expand the shop so that when she is old she will be solely dedicated to it.  This is her fifth loan with MFP and she will pay her dues timely.  With these funds she will increase her stock of merchandise for all types of candy.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jenson Abraham, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":231432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandise for her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-04T21:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ciria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957721},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227971},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423203},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116455},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011402},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:47Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595018},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989322},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":100.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210614},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":200.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640302}],"funded_date":"2008-12-19T23:16:47Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenson Abraham","image":206726}},{"id":80831,"name":"Manija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":244191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery
