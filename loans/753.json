They are working hard to support their children who are now in college, because they know that education is quite important for their children\u2019s future and security.\r\n\r\nTeresita operates a variety store adjacent to their house. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Teresita earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also earn extra income from a direct sales business like AVON.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day\r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan to buy additional grocery items, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. The loan will also ensure extra capital for her direct selling business, and she can offer more AVON products to her old and new customers. This will bring forth added income for the family and will improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of expanding her business, possibly to a mini-grocery store. In this way she can give her children a good future and help them attain their dreams. She does not only hope for material things for her children, but most importantly she wants them to serve God and get involved in church ministry.

She\u2019s married with five children, is a hard worker. Her husband had been earning a very low wage that didn't cover all the family's expenses, so he left for Russia two years ago to earn more money. That\u2019s why Saodat saw that it was necessary to enter the family business. She began to sell  foodstuffs in her family grocery store, with the help of her younger son. The business is stable, and that allows her to improve the living condition of her family.

They face an obstacle because they do not have enough money to buy fertilizer to support their field. To deal with this problem, Mrs. Sann C. is asking for a loan to buy fertilizer for the fields, and she would use the rest of loan to purchase fuel to water the field to make her crops more productive. She is the mother of three children who are employed in a garment factory.\r\n\r\nOne member in this group has a loan that is end-of-term, and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is 29 years old and lives with her husband Dante, who is also 29 years old, and her four-year-old son Johan.  Living together in their own house in a quiet village in the mountains of Peru, they are very proud of all they have accomplished so far.\r\n\r\nEvery day is a constant struggle to make progress. Brisayda has to work seven days a week, from early morning until nightfall, but she finds the strength for this as she is very energetic. She runs a business selling groceries in the shop she has owned for four years in her own home. There she sells the wide variety of products that are sought after by her regular customers, who she serves in a friendly manner, as this business generates a good income.\r\n\r\nBrisayda knows that her efforts are rewarded and so she works day after day, with almost no time to rest. She gets up very early to look after her little ones, get them ready for school and then start work. Sometimes life shows us just how much a mother is capable of doing for the wellbeing of her children. Without tiring, nothing stops Brisayda - she is indefatigable.\r\n\r\nThis is the seventh loan Brisayda has had from Kiva Field Partner, Microfinanzas Prisma (MFP). There is no doubt about her responsibility, and furthermore she does not want to let down her community bank, which includes other enterprising women.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures. She provides transportation, buys and sells rice, and is also a pump boat operator for fishing.  Her husband Sergio A., who is 47 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 17 to 28 years old, with two of them already working and the youngest child currently going to school.\r\n\r\nFederita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Federita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 27,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $233, thus raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing 30,000 PHP, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her future, her business and her family's needs. Federita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The couple works hard in order to earn money to sustain their basic needs and to have savings for the future of their children.  They wanted both of their children to finish college.  Bienvendia also dreams of having a concrete house, which is separate from her variety store.\r\n\r\nBienvendia has been a member of ASHI for two years.  As a member, she maintains her good performance in repayment and attendance because she does not want ASHI and its field partner to lose their trust in her.\r\n\r\nBienvendia has requested a loan of 20,000.00 PHP, which will be used as a down payment for a motorcycle. This motorcycle will help decrease the family's  expense for transporting their child to school.  It could also give them additional income.  Bienvendia will also invest some of her loan as additional capital for her variety

She graduated from trading college and has worked in this sphere for 30 years.  \r\nIn 2000, after the death of her husband, she became the only bread-winner for her three children. In order to find means of subsistence, Farida tried her hand at reselling footwear at the local market. In 2005, she obtained her first loan to broaden the range of goods she sold. This loan was used as intended and repaid without any delays.  \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, Farida lost her business during violent clashes in the city of Osh caused by political turmoil. Her small shop was burned to ashes. However, she doesn\u2019t give up easily and is ready to resume her lost business and continue her work. To help her do this, Farida is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS. She plans to spend the extra profits on providing a good education for her daughter.  \r\n\r\nFarida is optimistic person, who doesn't look back and moves ahead. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners use Kiva funding to assist the especially vulnerable.

He is married and lives with his wife Mary, 27-year-old son, daughter-in-law and 2-year-old granddaughter. \r\n<br>Valiko is a taxi driver. He drives his own car and earns approximately 500 Laris per month. Recently, the number of customers has decreased because he has had to charge higher prices for his service because of the petrol price increase. Not many villagers can afford to use the taxi service at a higher price. Because of the abovementioned problem, Valiko has decided to change his taxi's fuel system from petrol to gas, which is cheaper than petrol and will reduce the cost of transportation by 40 to 45 per cent.

What he is able to bring home as salary varies, so Anita\u2019s work supplements the family\u2019s budget.  This loan will be used to strengthen the capital earned from selling sodas and will be invested in the purchase of the raw materials to make hamburgers, tacos, etc.  The women\u2019s short-term goal is to be able to count on their financial resources to make home improvements, both on the roof and floors."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":953559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"buy soft drinks, juices, crackers, and candies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Paso Canoas, Puntarenas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":397680,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30387.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":30894.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31409.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31932.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":32464.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33006.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33556.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34115.43},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":34684.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":35262.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":35849.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":34117.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.38,"local_amount":58351.03,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-28T08:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":58351.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259110051},{"amount":118.99,"local_amount":59152.12,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":59152.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263326322},{"amount":71.16,"local_amount":35374.89,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-21T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":35374.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271078934},{"amount":132.57,"local_amount":65900.17,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":65900.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276652753},{"amount":70.28,"local_amount":34937.38,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34937.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283496967},{"amount":106.4,"local_amount":52891.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-18T08:04:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52891.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294893613},{"amount":113.83,"local_amount":56586,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":56586,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614225},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":34487.11,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-17T08:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34487.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347073048}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T03:31:37Z","paid_date":"2013-03-17T08:38:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Jones","image":628894}},{"id":377524,"name":"Thoeurn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A widower from a village of the Thmor Koul district, Thoeurn is 32 years old and has no children.

","en":"The Sope Serigne Babacar Sy Group is an association of businesswomen who own small stores in Thi\u00e8s, a city located 70 kilometers from Dakar. This group, named after a great Tijani marabout, was set up in 2006 by entrepreneurial women who where eager to increase their purchasing power through a <i>tontine<\/i> (a rotating savings and credit system where a group of individuals regularly contribute an agreed amount; the total amount is paid alternately to an individual member). However, after several years of successfully operating their <i>tontine<\/i>, the group members decided to join the microfinance institution UIMCEC which could grant them loans without security. Under the supervision of a loan officer of the village bank, the group was divided into subgroups of five members, each subgroup with a chairwoman and a treasurer. Right now there are 14 such subgroups. They may have the same members for many years. The Sope Serigne Babacar Sy Group meets every 20th of the month. The members of each subgroup pay their installment to their chairwoman who, with the assistance of the treasurer, is in charge of repaying the whole sum to the village bank.\r\n\r\nThe chairwoman of the subgroup Sope Serigne Babacar Sy No. 5, which applies now for its second loan, is Mrs Oumou N. and the treasurer is Mrs Ndeye Ndella T., both residents of Thi\u00e8s. Mrs N., aged 48, is married and the mother of five children. She has passionately run her store for 15 years. She sells chili pepper, shea butter and <i>n\u00e9t\u00e9tou<\/i> (a popular condiment in West Africa) at the market in Thi\u00e8s. She will use her loan to get fresh supplies from Bamako in Mali. Her earnings enable her to provide for her family's daily needs and pay the school fees for her children.\r\n\r\nThe other members of her subgroup are Mrs Ndeye Ndella T. (the treasurer) who sells fish, Mrs Ndou Gou N. who sells perfume, Mrs Ndioba G. who sells <i>bubus<\/i> (African dresses for both women and men) and cloths, and Mrs Anta M. who sells jewelry and <i>thiouraye<\/i> (a traditional mixture of grains and fragrant wood that is burnt with coal or charcoal).\r\n\r\nTo bolster their activities, they apply for a loan of 500,000 CFA francs, and each will receive a share of 100,000 CFA francs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva

School staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans.

But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

Maria learned about the work that Fundacion Realidad does, and after talking with her neighbours they decided to form a group in order to be able to request a loan that will benefit their businesses. The members are housewives who like to have their own income and help with family expenses: Yolanda R. (children's clothing and costume jewellery sales), Mar\u00eda Elena Sol\u00eds (toy and gift bag sales), Diana Karina Rodr\u00edguez (footwear sales through a catalogue) and Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas D. Sol\u00eds (cosmetics sales through a catalogue).\r\nMar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas is the group's representative; her family is made up of her child who is in first grade, and her husband Juan who is a driver.\r\nShe has sold cosmetics through a catalogue for two years, when thanks in part to the motivation of her sister in law she decided to learn a business. Now she is satisfied with her sales, and catalogues are changed every two months. She tries to take advantage of this, most of her clients are women.

The other women are also members of the group \"Mujeres Exitosas\" which translates to \"Successful Women\". They are pictured at Gloria's house. \r\n\r\nGloria is a hardworking and active woman. The members of the group chose the name \"Successful Women\" for their group because they want to be successful at everything that they do. Gloria is the leader of the group. She lives in San Juan Tuxtepec in neighborhood 1 which belongs to the municipality Chapa de Mota in the state of Mexico. \r\n\r\nGloria is 30 years old, is married and is the mother of 3 boys. Her first son is named Sergio de Jesus and is 12 years old. The second is named Luis Angel and is 10 years old and the third is named Jose Julian and is seven years old.  Gloria's husband is named Juan de Jesus. He is 36 years old and is an assistant mason. Her husband sometimes has to work in Mexico City for one to two months at a time without seeing his family. \r\n\r\nGloria is a homemaker but also works in embroidery and sells her napkins to people in the community. On market days she has a stall where she shows her embroidery. The images she embroiders range from animals such as deer, geese and others to all types of flowers. The napkins Gloria embroiders are labor intensive. She has to sit for hours to embroider. Generally, it takes Gloria two days to embroider a small napkin and it takes two weeks for large items such as covers and blankets. It is difficult on occasions to find someone to purchase her embroidery. In her area people do not pay much for something that is so labor intensive. Gloria looks for people from other states or countries that admire her work and pay well. \r\n\r\nGloria has dedicated herself to embroidery since she was a child. It was passed down in her family from women like her mother and grandmother. She has years of experience in this field.  Embroidery is something that can eventually pay well and be a successful business. She needs help to take her embroidery to places where people from other places can see her embroidery and pay well for it. \r\n\r\nGloria's community has few resources and the majority of people live humbly and raise animals such as sheep and cattle or grow corn. Currently, few women know how to embroider and sell embroidery. \r\n\r\nThe following women are the members of Gloria's group: Carlota P. F. who is 63 years old; Beatriz Adriana G. M. who is 34 years old; Ana Karen Perez V. who is 19 years old; Araceli Felilpa R. T. who is 26 years old; Claudia Raquel A. B. who is 34 years old; Sara F. Asunsion who is 45 years old; Gloria A. B. who is 30 years old; Liliana S. H. who is 22 yearls old and Lilia R. Desidero who is 30 years old. \r\n\r\nThis is Gloria's group of successful women and it is a group of women that is united and that help each other. They get along well and have known each other for many years. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":636165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase thread in various colors and napkins to embroider.

Sabirakhan works as a librarian in the main regional library in Bazarkorgon village and is known as a responsible and civilized person. After the Soviet Union fell apart and prices rose dramatically, Sabirakhan's salary was no longer enough to support her family. To make ends meet she began raising livestock and growing produce. Due to her diligent work and perseverance her household now has two cows and a big warm barn for all her animals. Sabirakhan also has a 1.2 acre plot of irrigated land where she grows cotton, tomatoes and other produce for sale. To further grow her farming business Sabirakhan has turned to \"Bai Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 130,000 som which she will use to purchase produce from other farmers for resale at her market stand. In the future Sabirakhan is planning to use the profits from the loan to build a second barn where she will store her produce over the winter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":928246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to broaden the assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kenesh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabirakhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2012-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1400,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":65507.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938371},{"amount":1400,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":65507.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426575}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T22:22:08Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":369345,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is 53 years old and has five children.

She runs a small business selling fabrics in the central market.  She would like to get a loan to buy winter fabrics to prepare for the coming colder fall and winter seasons. Davlatmoh buys the fabrics in Dushanbe. She has been in this business for 18 years, after her husband left her alone with six children to support.

He is in his late thirties and he lives in Ntasen, Bamenda, Cameroon.\r\n\r\nG. was motivated to become a GHAPE member in 2003 when GHAPE extended its activities to his neighborhood in Ntasen. He saw this as an opportunity to make something out of his life. Since then he has taken and repaid four successive loans, each one higher than the previous. He even was and is able to cater for his family like in paying bills and planning for the future from the savings he made from his loan activities.\r\n\r\nG. has been through some difficulties in the thick and thin of life. He was and is still up to the task. He has resolved a lot of challenges in life such as the death of his mother and brother in 1982 and 2007 respectively.\r\n  \r\nG. plans to invest his fourth loan in a bamboo business. More specifically he will buy bamboo in bulk and then retail it. He has a longstanding experience in this business. G. lives a few meters from the major market in the area. \r\n\r\nThe profit from his business activities will be used for the education and welfare of his family members.\r\n\r\nHis community stands to benefit from his activities in that they will not have to go as far or wait until market day to get what they want. He will also sell at a reasonable price because he prefers a quick turnover over a longer period of time rather than a higher profit margin.\r\n\r\nG. loves GHAPE because of the low interest rate and the social interactions among members.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

W. is 33 years old, single, and has two children aged 7 and 14. She is a very hardworking, humble and down-to-earth lady. Jane has a salon from which she provides hair and beauty services to local women. Her business is located at Gatundu, in a very busy market in Thika. Thika is the region in Kenya known for pineapple production. \nJane says that her business is profitable and the only major challenge is that there are many other salons in the areas so her customers are spoilt for choice. However, she works very hard to make sure her business remains successful. Jane is using her loan of 45,000 KES to buy more hair weaves and chemicals to expand her business. In the future, Jane hopes to open her own hair and beauty college. She also hopes to achieve a customer base of 1,000 people.

She has various businesses and says that she really likes her work. She enjoys it because that is how she has been able to earn money to take care of her three small children since she got divorced. She works making sugar and chocolate donuts and selling them in her town. Her ex-husband is the one who first taught her how to make donuts and she has been doing it for 4 years. \r\n\r\nLeonarda also works selling hamburgers at night, from Monday to Saturday. Now she is requesting a loan in order to sell silver jewelry. She is planning to go to Taxco in Guerrero to stock up on jewelry, because that is where they sell silver at a very reasonable price. She would like to begin selling jewelry in order to increase her earnings. \r\n\r\nLeonarda says that since she was very young, her parents imbued her with a love of work and that is why she is so hard-working, as well as responsible with her children and her home. Also, she recently put together some money to buy two pieces of land which she then resold at a higher price. With the capital from the sale, she was able to buy another larger piece of land which she is about to sell. She will continue investing in property and eventually with her earnings she will build a house for herself and her children, because the place they currently live is a rental. \r\n\r\nHer goal for her hamburger business is to put a permanent restaurant in her home so her clients have a comfortable place to eat. With the jewelry sales, she would like to build her clientele and be able to sell her merchandise quickly in order to buy more. \r\n\r\nThe other 10 members are Erika, Maria de los \u00c1ngeles, Araceli, Maria del Pilar, Marisela, Adriana, Raquel, Lucia, Marisela, Teresa.

Thi Vu, 31 years old, has been participating in the Fund for 9 years.  Before joining the Fund she worked in the fields like many other women in the region.  In 1999, she started planning with her husband to join the Fund for seed money to go into business and improve their family\u2019s finances.  Everyday her husband uses the money borrowed to go buy baby pigs in town and surrounding areas to sell to retailers with freezers.  Mrs. Vu buys wheat from farmers and resell it to processors who grind the wheat.  In the first few funding rounds, since they were new to their respective businesses, the couple only borrowed a small amount.  After some time the couple became familiar with their businesses and bravely increased their loan amounts.  The businesses have increased the family\u2019s income day by day; currently the family\u2019s income ranges from 3,500,000 VND to 4,500,000 VND per month.  Thanks to this improvement the children are better off in their daily lives and their schooling.  Mrs. Vu would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to buy more stock for her business without having to pay a high interest rate with credit.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft n\u0103m nay 31 tu\u1ed5i v\u00e0 \u0111\u00e3 tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 9 n\u0103m.Tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng ch\u1ecb ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng nh\u01b0 bao ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef kh\u00e1c t\u1ea1i \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng.

His wife is a merchant and she gets up in the mornings to prepare breakfast for her husband who has to get ready for work early as he works as a taxi driver and needs to check his car before leaving.  He has been in this business for fourteen years and the job can sometimes be tiring because the situation is bad and clients do not want to pay what the trips are worth.  However, there are good days.  He started his business by buying his car with his own funds.

Experienced and talented in the business, Nodira has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family. Throughout the last four years, IMON International has provided ongoing assistance to Nodira\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Nodira has used each loan wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 4000 Somoni to purchase more clothing for selling. With the rotation of supplies in her business, she plans to repay the loan within 6 months. The well being of Nodira\u2019s family and her business are in your hands. Nodira and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.    <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her partner in a rented home.  She is the mother of a 3 year old girl, who is the motivation for her efforts. Her business is the purchase, care and sale of guinea pigs. The meat from her guinea pigs is in high demand at Sunday fairs because she feeds them well and ensures they grow to a good size.  To do this, she gets up very early each day to cut grass to feed them.  She prevents them from eating oats and alfalfa which is stored for months when there is drought.  Nelly cares for her little animals with a lot of love, as she knows that it is thanks to them that she brings in money to meet her needs.  \r\n\r\nThe two years she has spent in this business have taught her to care for her animals and keep them parasite free in order to offer healthy meat to all her customers.  In the future, Nelly hopes to increase the number of guinea pigs that she has, and to build appropriate cages for them.  She finds that the most difficult part of her work is to root out bad weeds in the grass that she uses to feed the animals, because if she doesn't the guinea pigs that eat them will die.  Nelly proudly shows us her guinea pigs in this photo.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she is committed to making payments on the dates scheduled by her loan advisor.  The money that she is requesting will be used to have cages built for her many guinea pigs.  With this she will be able to select them according to size.  She will also purchase concentrated feed for the development and fattening up of her little animals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":323696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of feed and construction of cages ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641244}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T10:06:07Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":114443,"name":"Huyen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huy\u1ec1n Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n was born in 1952 (no. 010102080014).

All of the children are in school. \r\n\r\nRichard has a bakery business that he inherited from his father 20 years ago. His market area is in the Ishaka suburbs,  with Mitooma secondary school and the University nearby. His main challenge has been the constant increase in price of the raw materials, such as flour and oil. He uses his motorcycle to supply the products to his customers and this makes his work a bit easier. \r\n\r\nHis kind of products include doughnuts, cookies, brown bread, pancakes, kebab and chapattis and luckily he has customers for all his products. Richard had a dream of opening up a store in the suburban town with a van to expand in the market, as well as have all his children educated up to the university level. He needs a loan to help with buying firewood and flour for baking purposes.

El dinero que ahora solicita lo piensa invertir en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para su pr\u00f3xima siembra."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":403790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de fertilizantes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T22:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":680.92,"local_amount":1945.48,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1964.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124031},{"amount":369.08,"local_amount":1054.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672636}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T01:41:58Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147318,"name":"Leang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leang M., a 47-year-old married woman with two children, lives with her family in Phnom Penh.

She is 45 years old, married, and has adult-aged children.\n\nRosemarie owns and operates a business venture into raising pigs for sale. During the selling season, she earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2004, Rosemarie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":453372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

the Philippines. She earns her living by operating a general store.\r\n\r\nIrene\u2019s husband, Rodrigo B., is  61 years old and works as carpenter and welder, and earns about 5,000 PHP per month. They have four children, who are between 32 and 38 years old, and six grandchildren. Three of the children have their own families, but still help their parents with some of the household expenses. The remaining single child also works and helps with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nIrene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, in the hopes that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase the family's income by operating a general store and fruit vending. Now, she earns an average monthly income of 4,000 PHP from her business activities.\r\n\r\nIrene is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP was used to fund operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 14th loan, the amount of 16,000 PHP, which she intends to use for her general store and fruit vending business. Irene is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":468675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She states that she decided to launch this business because her husband works in agriculture and does not have a steady income. Mar\u00eda del Carmen got in touch with a wholesaler who fills special orders depending on the season (they are currently making school uniform pants). He picks up the merchandise and sells it throughout the different areas of the country's mountainous region. <p>\r\nShe has also started her own small general store. She plans on using this business to help her family get ahead in life. This business has welcomed many customers and neighbors due to the fact that they live in a rural area that is far from town, so they do not have access to the products that they consume on a daily basis. Mar\u00eda del Carmen would like to expand this business, which is why she needs to request a 1,000.00 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa for the very first time. She will invest this money in purchasing goods for her general store. <p>\r\nShe is a well-known and respected person in her community. Her greatest wish is to keep making her general store grow so that she can continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":506800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase goods for in-home general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chepito - Morrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":71.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":89.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":95.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.98,"local_amount":71.94,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:38Z","rounded_local_amount":75.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934689},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":71.1,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":74.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662313},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":74.4,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":78.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695017},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":74.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878062},{"amount":30.28,"local_amount":80.73,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618090},{"amount":30.42,"local_amount":81.12,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":85.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832492},{"amount":31.21,"local_amount":83.23,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":87.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099099},{"amount":66.42,"local_amount":177.13,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":186.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529986},{"amount":70.62,"local_amount":188.3,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":198.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409487},{"amount":36.67,"local_amount":97.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":103.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196107945}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T00:09:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":189045,"name":"Salinah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salinah S., 45, is married to Benjamin Ossen who is 54yrs old and an employee of Kuda (Kerio Valley Development Authority).

She is 26 years old, married, and has one infant child. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nancy C. Group. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, she owns and operates a business providing motorcycle transportation to local community members. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $100 a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nancy joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. Nancy is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business. This will be her fourth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":557126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and food vending. Her husband, Lemuel, who is 42 years old, works as a carpenter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 8 to 19 years old. Liza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14000, which she intends to use to as revolving capital for her fish-vending activities. She plans to continue to save for future home repairs and the education of her children. Liza D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She started the business five months ago.  Her husband\u2019s cousin invited her to join the catalogue shoe sales.  She has used profits to buy shoes to display.  They lend her a display case in a local pharmacy to display her products.\r\n\r\nHer business is important thanks to the profits it earns which she used primarily to buy more merchandise and to meet household expenses.  The part she likes best about her business is going out daily to offer her products and receive orders for footwear.  On average, she sees between 5-8 customers daily.  Her business faces challenges like the inclemency of the weather, especially when it rains besides facing competition from people in her community who are also into catalogue sales.\r\n\r\nShe uses profits from the business primarily to reinvest in more shoes.  Her short term goal is to add other items to her inventory like ladies\u2019 purses and blouses.  She hopes to accomplish this first with the loan and then with profits from the investment.\r\n\r\nHer business is very important to her because it will help her support her family economically as well as make improvements to her house in the future like installing a door, window frames, cement flooring and glass windows.\r\n\r\nShe would like to develop further in sales and grow professionally.  With respect to the loan, she feels happy because she will be able to invest more in her business.

is 38 years old and is a mother of 2 young boys that are still in school.  When she realized that her husband's income as a taxi driver was not covering the basic necessities of her home, she decided to support him, and started to prepare and sell ice cream.  In order to excel in this endeavor, she repurposed a space in her humble home and at first only catered to her neighbors using a small wheelbarrow that her husband built for her business.  Today, after having dedicated endless hours of work and much effort, she has obtained a small ice cream cart.  The small business she has built has also allowed her to offer employment to three young people in her city. <p>\r\n\r\nHer hopes are to better the quality and variety of the products she offers, with the purpose of increasing customer preference and satisfaction.  In order to fulfill this goal, she is asking for a loan of $500 that she will use to acquire a freezer to preserve the quality and taste of her delicious ice cream.

Consequentially, Mrs. T. decided to rent a place to start buying and selling wastes. Mrs. T. used the loan of the first round to invest in poultries, but she didn\u2019t make much profit. Learning the mistake, Mrs. T. since then has invested the loans from TYM in her business, from which she earns about 200000 VND per day. The business has aided her family financially a great deal. In the next round of loan, Mrs. T. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND ($550) to expand her business. Her family\u2019s monthly income is about 6.000.000 VND. <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

This is 35-year-old Mary S. from Mwanza. She is married with two children between the ages of 1 and 9 years old. Mary S. has been running a beauty salon since 1999.

She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Mary currently earns about 200USD from her business.

Mary thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<p>ABOUT SELFINA!\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase weaving tools, long hair extensions, clothes, and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027600},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613601},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010680},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232966},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664757}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T19:49:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Naegeli","image":264373}},{"id":98075,"name":"Tenning","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Tenning  D. est une vendeuse ambulent de bissap et du mil ; elle habite \u00e0 Bambey dans la r\u00e9gion de Diourbel ; elle est mari\u00e9e et a 6 ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le m\u00e9tier.

She helps them pay their electricity, water and grocery bills, which leaves her with little left over for university. Janina wants very much to finish her studies and improve her future, so she started working in a market frequented by Nicaraguans, where products are cheap and plentiful. Thankfully she found a new job with better pay, and she has been working there for two years. Now that she has a better income, Janina wants to build her own room so that she can have more privacy. She needs credit for building materials like stone, sand, cement, iron and zinc. This loan will allow her to begin her project and finish it gradually. Janina says she is studying English because language opens doors that will allow her to improve her station in life, earn a better living, and help her parents so that they'll want for nothing. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":424150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Building materials (stone, cement, sand, iron)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-11T05:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janina De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.75,"local_amount":1014.99,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601757},{"amount":52.22,"local_amount":1044.41,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1080.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003200},{"amount":57.21,"local_amount":1144.24,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1184.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841357},{"amount":56.54,"local_amount":1130.71,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874271},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":702.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":727.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604170},{"amount":37.34,"local_amount":746.73,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":772.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639634},{"amount":37.39,"local_amount":747.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":773.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821408},{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":956.63,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":989.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561422},{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":511.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":529.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770381}],"funded_date":"2009-11-12T00:37:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":155610,"name":"Vedith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"              La se\u00f1ora Vedith, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cSargento Lores\u201d, Distrito de Morales, Provincia de San Martin, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

He learned to farm when he was a boy and now raises mainly potatoes and corn.  His wife and children help him and periodically check the crops to make sure that they are free of insects and disease.  When the requirement for labor increases, he hires additional field hands.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that he enjoys working in the fields very much, because he does it independently and with no pressure.  Even though it\u2019s hard work, it\u2019s rewarded when he sells his harvest.  This is why he wants to acquire more land and increase his number of animals.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan through MFP and he\u2019s very happy to know that he has financial backing.

Guisselle has a business producing handmade woven garments including sweaters, toques, gloves, scarves, socks, etc. She also offers decorating services for special events such as birthdays, communions, and work parties. Her main source of revenue is her garment business, but she involves herself with both activities in order to maintain a steady stream of income. Guisselle has been working in this capacity for the past eight years.  Her revenue generating activities have helped her to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nThis will be Guisselle's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Guisselle decided to apply for a loan after completing a capacity building course in business administration at the Foundation.  With this loan, Guisselle plans to make investments in both of her productive activities. Specifically, she plans to buy different colors of high quality wool and make repairs to her weaving machine by replacing the cones.  She also plans to use the loan to purchase balloons and party decorations. Currently Guiselle has pending orders in both of her activities.  She lacks sufficient working capital in order to make investments, which would enable her to satisfy the demands of her clients. This loan will help to address this obstacle. \r\n\r\nWith two children and a home to take care of, Guisselle is busy most days until 3 PM. She dedicates the hours between 3 and 6 to weaving. If necessary, she will weave after dinner until 11 PM.  When she provides party decoration services, her husband assists her.  Guisselle\u00b4s long-term goal is to fulfill her business plan, which includes generating sufficient revenues from her productive activities in order to open a weaving workshop and a gift shop. As mentioned, the main factor inhibiting the growth of her business is a lack of access to working capital. Guisselle plans to use this loan to make bulk purchases of quality raw materials, which will ensure a better price from her suppliers and lower her overall costs of production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":656799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded

R. lives in the Moyotepec community in the city of Ayala in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 42 years old, and she has an elementary school education.  She will use the loan to increase the inventory in her business.  She started her business two years ago in her sister\u2019s house.  There is a soccer field in the Abelardo neighborhood, and the players asked if she sold water or soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nShe then decided to make a small investment to establish a stand, and she started to sell water and soft drinks.  Her sister lent her the space that she currently uses.  It is on the side of the soccer field in the Abelardo neighborhood.  She opens it on Saturdays and Sundays.  Sometimes her sister\u2019s children help her take care of the business during the week. \r\n\r\n Before she sold food she sold shoes by catalog.  She did not like this business activity very much because she had to walk a lot, and in her new business she is not as tired.  She is going to use the loan to buy soft drinks, bottles of water, snacks, juice, and sweets.  She sells these the most.  It takes her ten minutes using public transportation to get to her business.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is very important because her work gives her enough income for her living expenses.  In addition, it gives her great satisfaction to run her own business.  Also, through her business she knows a lot of people, and they all treat her respectfully.\r\n\r\nIn her business she primarily waits on the players, their families, and the fans that go to the games.  One of the challenges that her business faces is the growing competition, which has caused her sales to drop.  She uses the income from her business to invest in more products for her business.  She also pays for the utilities at her business and her home.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy different products than the ones she sells in order to have more variety in her business.  Her future plans are to set up her business like a grocery store and to increase the number of customers she has.\r\n\r\nTomasa is married, and her husband is a bricklayer.  They have three daughters.  Rub\u00ed is 17 years old, Yesica is 22 years old, and Jazm\u00edn is 20 years old.  As two of her daughters are married, they keep house and are not able to help in her business.  Her youngest daughter goes to school.  Sometimes her nephew helps her take care of the business during the week.  On Saturday and Sunday she personally takes care of the customers.  \r\n\r\nMoyotepec is a peaceful village with fields.\r\n\r\nTomasa wants to say thanks to Kiva and to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cI am grateful to those who are able to help us improve our businesses with this loan.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":684261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soft drinks like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Jarrito, Squirt, Mirinda, and bottles of  purified water and sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430797},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850055},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292328},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1005.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160593}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T00:12:36Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":266912,"name":"Obdulia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Obdulia tiene  40 a\u00f1os, vive con su  esposo y 4 hijos en su propia casa.
