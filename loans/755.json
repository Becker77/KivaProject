She lives with her husband in a large traditional family in Fama, in downtown Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After running several unsuccessful businesses, she started selling traditional soaps (black soap) five years ago, a business she learned from one of her neighbors. She runs this business at home in Sikasso, where she's very much in demand due to the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, she decided to join Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, three years ago. She's seeking her fourth individual loan, and all previous loans were repaid without problems.

He is married with Esidora Quispe, 42 years old, and the fruit of their immense love is their 5 children. They live together in their own home in the community of Carmen Pampa near San Francisco. Satan is an agriculturist and his parents taught him the business since he was a boy. He has been working his fields for 20 years, cultivating the following products: cocoa, coffee, and bananas. During the harvest season he depends on his family's support and that of hired laborers. He knows that his earnings directly depend on the quality of the harvest. He sells his cocoa and coffee harvest in the city of San Francisco where he gets the best prices for the quality of the grains. What he most enjoys about his work is the harvest because he is able to see that months\u2019 worth of hard work have not been in vain. In the future he wants to buy more land to increase production. This is his 16th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and it will be a great support in the progress of his business. He is very well liked by the other members of the communal bank, especially because he is united with them. With the two thousand nuevos soles he requests he will purchase more fertilizer to improve the quality of his fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":705586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers for his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-03T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2004.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850579}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T23:02:01Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":274423,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha is a married woman who owns a house that has electricity but not running water.

She lives with her son in her own house.  She learned farming when she was very young, planting and harvesting potatoes and other crops, all thanks to her father who was a farmer.  Farming has become her main source of income now.  She plants potatoes, olluco, maize and beans because there's a lot of demand for them.  She also sells what she grows in her own shop.  She says that she likes farming because it is what she knows best, even though it requires much sacrifice.  She has to get up at dawn every day to work her fields but it's worth the effort at harvest time.  She takes her crop to market and sells to the wholesalers there who pay her with real money!  She, in turn, uses the money to provide a better quality of life for her child.  Epifania is an enterprising woman and she wants to plant more crops in the future and increase her production.  She also wants to stock her store with various products because, she says, the business is very profitable.  This is Epifania's second MFP loan.

Many years ago her father lent her 500 lempiras and with that she bought some second hand clothing to later resell it to her neighbors. She made a profit from her sales and then bought more merchandise.  \n\nAfter a while she became aware of FAMA and requested a loan which she was granted and with that she was able to change her business. Now Luz earns her living selling seasonings, which she learned from one of her sisters who was in the business and did very well. \n\nThree of her four children help her prepare the seasonings and later she goes out to the nearby villages to sell them. She travels by hitchhiking. She goes out to the street and waits until someone she knows passes by and picks her up. She makes her sales every 15 days but she also makes sales from her house permanently. Her biggest obstacles are the weather and, when she is unable to find a ride, having to walk long distances.\n\nWith the support of this loan she will buy seasonings such as annatto, spices, cinnamon, cloves, rosemary, linseed, as well as little bags and staples for packaging. She will be able to supply her business with the support of this loan and she hopes her sales increase. Her goal is to continue supporting her children so that they will graduate. Two of them already have graduated thanks to her effort. \n\nLuz has been a client of FAMA for 15 loan cycles and she is punctual with her repayments.  \n       "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":807568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seasonings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanci Jakeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Celenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy Liceira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suyapa Argentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":34500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":17477.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657985},{"amount":925,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":17477.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784925}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T18:57:20Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Monica Wooters","image":null}},{"id":319503,"name":"And Soukali Jeeguene Pire 24 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est compos\u00e9 de 5 membres qui habitent dans le village de Pire \u00e0 cent km de DAKAR la capitale du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, leur activit\u00e9 principale est le commerce de produits agricoles  les tubercules de manioc.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells electronic cell phone loads (prepaid cell phone credits) and offers direct-selling products to her customer. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She has a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa.Teresa hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Ella tiene, 7 vacas, 3 chanchos, pero antes contaba con varias ovejas a las que vend\u00eda y sacaba buenas ganancias. Por problemas de mala administraci\u00f3n y sobre-gastos, no pudieron comprar m\u00e1s de estos animales para continuar con el negocio. As\u00ed empezaron a sembrar papa, en las peque\u00f1as parcelas que posee, de esa manera pudo pagar sus deudas. Considera que su negocio es rentable, \u201cpor cabeza ganaba  de 15 a 20 soles\u201d, comenta. En el futuro, ella espera volver al ritmo anterior, y seguir con la venta de los carneros, administrar bien sus negocios y mandar a sus peque\u00f1os hijos a estudiar a la ciudad de Tarma y m\u00e1s adelante facilitarles una educaci\u00f3n superior y profesional. Es la octava vez que ella trabaja con MFP. Est\u00e1 entusiasmada con las visiones que tiene, y que espera alcanzar gracias a su trabajo coordinado.

She and her family live in her mother\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica is a small quantity livestock merchant.  She has 7 cows and 3 pigs.  She used to have several sheep that she\u2019d sell and make good profits.  Because of poor administration and cost overruns she was unable to buy more of these animals to continue in business.  They started to grow potatoes on the small plots of land she has and was able to repay her debts that way.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable.  \u201cFor each head I\u2019d earn 15 to 20 soles,\u201d she comments.  In the future she hopes to recover her previous rhythm and continue to sell sheep, to run her business well and to send her children to school in the city of Tarma and later on provide them with higher and professional education.\r\n\r\nThis is the 8th time she\u2019s worked with MFP.  She\u2019s excited with the vision she has and that she hopes to reach thanks to coordinated work.  Ver\u00f3nica will use her loan to buy at least 7 small lambs.

He also takes care of his two grandchildren, the children of his daughter. He decided to take up the responsibility of his grandchildren together with their mother (his daughter) since she had the two children out of wedlock. Rather than send his daughter away, he encouraged and cautioned her to take care of herself not to get another child until she is ready to take care of them. They live in Kayole, an informal settlement area within Nairobi. In addition, Mr. W. is a church pastor, and he also supports some of his church members.\r\n<p>\r\nWilson has been a carpenter now for a period of four years and apart from that, he also does welding. He started by doing small contracts from schools within his community. It was not an easy start but he was driven by determination since he wanted to be involved in another activity besides being a pastor. He borrowed Ksh 20,000.00 (USD 285) from a friend and bought the basic items he needed in the carpentry workshop together with timber. He has been able to settle this loan with time and although he has had many difficulties, he has seen his business expanding through the many contracts he is getting. His major setback is the ability to deal with the growing number of contracts since his customers pay a minimal deposit, barely enough to enable him to make purchases for the requirements. He is now intending to make a set of desks and chairs for two schools within his community before schools reopen for the second term.\r\n<p>\r\nA loan of USD 900 is Wilson\u2019s plea to enable him purchase a drilling machine, timber, block board, and the backs and seats for the chairs. These will go a long way in enabling him to make a wide range of quality furniture for his customers in order to attract additional customers, and to retain the existing ones, especially from the nearby schools. This will also enable him to gain additional income that will help him to support both his family and members of his church better. The repayment period of the loan is 15 \u2013 18

Indriani membuka warungnya pada pagi hari pukul 06.00 pagi dan tutup pada pukul 06.00 sore.

This area is famous for its agricultural production of corn, potatoes, and other crops.  Tourist attractions such as the Cochapamba Lagoon are filled with reeds used for making mats, hats, and decorations.  Tasqui Hill provides a beautiful view of the parish and the entire city of Cuenca.  The people are very warm and friendly.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Rosa L. is one of the founding members of this Communal Bank.  She lives in the community of San Miguel in the El Valle Parish of Cuenca.  She is 32 years old, married, and has 5 children ranging in age from 1 to 18.  Her two oldest sons (the first and third children) are students at the Salesiano Technical School.  Her oldest daughter (the second child) graduated from a sewing academy and now works in order to contribute to the household expenses.  The second youngest child attends kindergarten in San Miguel.  Her husband works as a bricklayer, which has helped her family get ahead.  The most gratifying result of her hard work is being able to own a home.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa raises animals such as chickens, pigs, and guinea pigs.  She has been engaged in this business for several years and sells her animals in the community and at local fairs.  Rosa has worked with the Foundation on 19 previous loan cycles.  The funding she has received has benefited her home and her business.  With this new loan, she will buy more chickens and guinea pigs since they grow faster.  She will also purchase feed for the animals.  Her goal is to gradually increase the number of other animals that she raises so that her family can get ahead.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

G. is the leader of a group of five borrowers called Barclay Farm United.  He is 26 years old, married, and has two girls.  One of his girls is six years old and is in the 1st grade, the other is 3 months old.  F. and his family live in the Barclay Farm Community in Harbel, about 40 miles from the capital of Liberia, Monrovia.  He also helps care for two of his siblings who live with him, and regularly sends money to his parents who are farmers in Lofa County in northwest Liberia.\r\n\r\nF. currently attends night school, and is enrolled in the 11th grade.  His education was interrupted by the Liberian civil war, when his family went to neighboring Guinea to escape the fighting.  He sells hardware and tools from a stall at the Harbel Market, which is located on the Firestone Rubber Plantation.  Firestone's plantation in Liberia is one of the largest in the world, with a million acres under long-term lease from the Liberian government.\r\n\r\nF. says he started his business with 4,000 Liberian dollars in seed money from his father.  He originally sold tools and hardware from a wheelbarrow, but thanks to his hard work and perseverance he has been able to move up to selling at the market.  He hopes to move his shop to a storefront one day soon.  With his 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan, F. plans to buy more inventory for his business, such as nails, cutlasses (machetes), shovels, and hammers.\r\n\r\nF. credits his success in business to selling quality items and treating his customers well.  In future, he wants to have more children and hopes to be able to send them all to school so they get a good education.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, F. is the one holding the sign.

caracteriza, pues aunque no tiene maquinaria, ofrece vestidos para ni\u00f1as y accesorios a la medida y al gusto de sus clientes; su negocio consiste en comprar telas  e insumos de modister\u00eda para mandarle a fabricar a 3 confeccionistas, los mas fant\u00e1sticos vestidos, combinados con accesorios arm\u00f3nicos y adornos como sombreros cintillos, binchas adornadas, para ni\u00f1as que participan como ninfas, damas de honor en matrimonios, o en cumplea\u00f1os, bautizos y ocasiones elegantes y especiales de las familias. Mediante este sistema Aura  suministra a cr\u00e9dito y a muy buen precio sus productos, porque para ella es  muy  claro que con su calidad en los precios ella compite. Sus clientes   son  almacenes en los centro de Barranquilla y en muchas ciudades y municipios de la costa caribe como Bosconia, en el Departamento del Cesar,  Cienaga en el Departamento del Magdalena y Monter\u00eda en el Departamento de C\u00f3rdoba,  donde viaja semanalmente llevando sus productos  junto a su libreta de cuentas por cobrar para recuperar su dinero.\n\nElla trabaja en horario extendido y ha progresado mucho desde su primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo hasta la presente, sus ventas se han incrementado en un 50% y as\u00ed mismo sus ingresos y utilidades. Hoy est\u00e1 solicitando su tercer financiamiento y desea prepararse para la temporada alta del segundo semestre del a\u00f1o, comprando materias primas al  por mayor y de contado e insumos como telas y adornos para poder mandar a elaborar los dise\u00f1os mas apetecidos.\nSu meta y gran desaf\u00edo es hacer de sus hijos unos profesionales, ya que la mayor se grad\u00faa este a\u00f1o como bachiller y el menor terminar\u00e1 su nivel de primaria, por lo que tiene que  seguir realizando muchos esfuerzos  desde su populoso barrio ubicado en el sur de Barranquilla muy cerca de centros comerciales y del famoso estadio donde juega el equipo de futbol que mas quiere la ciudad: \u201cEl Junior de Barranquilla\u201d\n","en":"If you knew Se\u00f1ora Aura O., you\u2019d know that she personifies \u201csaleswoman.\u201d  Even though she doesn\u2019t have machines, she sells little girls\u2019 dresses and accessories to the size and preference of her customers.  Her business is buying material and dressmaking supplies to send out to three seamstresses.  The most fantastic dresses combined with the right accessories and adornments like headbands for hats and decorated binchas for girls who participate as nymphs, bridesmaids, or in birthdays, baptisms, elegant occasions, and special family events.\r\n\r\nThrough this system Aura sells her products on credit, and at a good price, because it is very clear to her that quality and price compete.  Her customers are stores in Barranquilla and in many cities and municipalities of the Caribbean coast like Bosconia in the Department of Cesar, Cienaga in the Department of Magdalena, and Monter\u00eda in the Department of C\u00f3rdoba where she travels weekly bringing her products alongside her accounting book to collect her money.  \r\n\r\nShe works extended hours and has progressed a lot since her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to the present.  Her sales have increased by 50% as well as her earnings and profits. Today she is taking out her third loan and wants to get ready for the high season (the second semester of the year) by buying wholesale raw materials and supplies like fabrics and decorations, paying in full, to be able to send out to have the best designs made.\r\n\r\nHer goal, and great challenge, is to make her children professionals since the oldest graduates from high school this year and the youngest finishes grade school.  She has to keep going as much as possible from her populous neighborhood, south of Barranquilla, very close to malls and the famous stadium where the city\u2019s most beloved team \u201cEl Junior de Barranquilla\u201d plays.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

For the past four years, she has been working in the sale of semi-Brazilian jewelry.  She has been married for over 13 years and has 3 children.  Her home is located by el Puente el Salto, in the Manabita capital.  She purchases with cash the jewelry and makes a 50% profit.  She buys the jewelry in the city of Portoviejo from a distributor.  She enjoys her business and wants to continue it because of the earnings and the benefits.  Our member began with $50 in capital.  Her method of selling her products is by traveling throughout the city and offering them to her friends but allowing them to pay in 2 payments.  Her husband is a security guard at a company in Portoviejo.  She is from the Manabita capital, while he is from the port city, Manta.  She plans to invest this loan in her jewelry business by purchasing earrings, necklaces, and rings.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and fish vending. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Joel C., who is 49 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 7 to  20 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Sunny joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Sunny has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,500 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase additional fishing equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children. \r\n\r\nMa. Sunny C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With her husband\u2019s income missing, bills started to pile up, and she decided to generate her own income to try to fill the gap. She likes what she sells and has developed a stable enterprise. \r\n\r\nCurrently Muhabbat has requested a loan in the size of $1000 USD to help purchase a new supply of items to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Juan, an overseas Filipino worker, and is the mother to their three children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to cover their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRegina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also does some direct selling. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of PHP 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRegina hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":890087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-14T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":6067,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6100.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571850},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3466,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3484.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529400},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3467,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3485.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738616}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T10:06:03Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":348232,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard is a 23-year-old married man with one child and owns a house in Kasese, Uganda.

Everyone in his village of Cabaiesti, and most rural areas throughout Moldova grew up around farm animals.  Most families in rural Moldova will have a small garden behind their house, chickens, possibly a few cows or a pig and maybe a horse for a carriage to help with daily activities and transportation (Most of these houses do not have running water, gas or plumbing and rely on an outhouse as a toilette). Mihail\u2019s family has always had a small farm, but he has not been involved in more commercial production. He would like to start now, having seen others in the area become successful entrepreneurs in raising animals. His brother owns a large barn formerly used in a collective farm, which, is already outfitted with most of the necessary equipment he needs and is an ideal location for Mihail\u2019s planned business. The operation would encompass 30 sheep, which would be used for milk production, cheese making called Brinza, as well as for wool, and 10 calves, which would be raised in part for reproduction and in part for meat. Mihail already has land on which he grows wheat and hay, which will serve as good feed for all the animals.

Nearly 10 years ago she decided to open a little wall-paper kiosk, a business she says was her calling. She was able to purchase a kiosk in the very center of the market that is easily accessible to many shoppers. Today, Tatyana\u2019s business yields $450 a month in profit with an investment of $2,000 in inventory. \r\n\r\nTatyana sees a great opportunity for business grown as spring approaches. Wall-papering is a very popular way to decorate in Ukraine and many people are ready to begin remodeling work after the cold and wet winter months are past. Tatyana\u2019s expertise in quality wall-paper is greatly appreciated by her customers. Her desire to assist clients and her entrepreneurial spirit are part of what makes her business successful. On a personal level, Tatyana desires to invest her earned profits into her son\u2019s college education. \r\n\r\nTatyana has requested a loan for $1,000 to broaden the assortment of wall-paper she offers at her kiosk so she will be ready for the busy season. She has proven to be a strong and reliable client with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d.

Thi Hai, 45 years old, has 5 children. 2 of them are grown-up and have stable jobs. In 2003, Mrs. Hai joined the TYM Fund to expand her inventory for business. Currently, her main source of income is from selling products made from bamboo. With her experiences and ability to foresee the demand of the villagers, she has made and sold more and more products. To increase her family's income, she also raises livestock. As such, her family's standard of living has been improving and her children are better taken care of. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1150USD) to continue investing in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

Because of his work, her husband does not live with her right now.  She has a small family business that offers fumigation services.  She has been running the business out of her home for the past 10 months, in an office that she put in to attend to her customers.  Everyone is very content with the service Elizabeth and her brother have been offering.  But the lack of investment capital limits the customers they can serve because they don\u2019t have the necessary supplies for fumigation.  However, they keep moving forward by offering the best service possible with the resources that they have.  Thanks to this business she is able to be with her family, especially her young son, without having to give up her job as a businesswoman.  She has been able to make this a profitable business and she is sure that in the future it will be an even more prosperous company.  Elizabeth has worked with MFP for 3 years  and is very happy with the financial support this institution offers.  With the money from this loan she will invest in large quantities of sprayers that will increase her earnings.  Buying the machines will help her serve more locations and perform routine maintenance.    help her serve more locations and perform routine maintenance.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":271988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Fumigation sprayers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T20:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":210.9},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":231.37},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":244.16},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":253.49},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":266.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":276.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":287.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.3},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.91,"local_amount":210.9,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":214.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423760},{"amount":71.53,"local_amount":228.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":232.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117069},{"amount":72.3,"local_amount":231.37,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":235.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011982},{"amount":76.3,"local_amount":244.16,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":248.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595567},{"amount":79.22,"local_amount":253.49,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":257.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989829},{"amount":83.3,"local_amount":266.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":271.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210965},{"amount":86.51,"local_amount":276.83,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":281.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640470},{"amount":89.93,"local_amount":287.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":292.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080117}],"funded_date":"2009-02-17T23:11:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":93327,"name":"Chhet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chhet M., 49, is a widow who lives with three of her children in the Siem Reap province.

From a young age he demonstrated a talent for agriculture.  He has always tried to be very responsible and today he has a crop of 25-30 sacks of potatoes that he grows in transitional fields.  He also grows beans and corn in irrigated fields.  Aquiles is very content with his farmwork.  When he finishes caring for his crops, he goes to help his father, because he wants to repay his father\u2019s efforts.  What his father likes best out of the whole agricultural process is the marketing, because he always hopes to get a good price for his crops.  But once he gets to the market, he gets a little clumsy and sometimes loses track of the accounting.  Aquiles always tries to help him out with some pointers.  Aquiles is the president of his community bank and this is his 8th loan with MFP.  In all of this time he has proven to be very responsible, both in his duties and in his payments.  The  loan he is asking for is to purchase fertilizer for his varied crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":293317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aquiles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3066.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080290}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T20:47:15Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":101519,"name":"Remi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remi D. is 32 years old and married with 2 children.

Vanessa wants to help her husband in earning income for their family.\r\nIn 2008, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She used her previous loans for her fishing business. Since Cardona is a coastal municipality and the main source of income for the people is fishing, she wants to continue her fishing business and continue putting additional investment into it. Now on her third loan, she requests a loan of 14,000 pesos as additional capital for her fishing business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 10 bundles of fish nets, rope, threads for fishing gear and also for the maintenance of her boat.\r\nShe is looking forward for a sustainable and profitable business. She also dreams of having her own house, and to be able to send her children to school until they finish college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":361512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is happy for the financing because she will be able to offer her students a greater variety of products this new school year that is about to begin.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":477191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy sweets, soft-drinks, pastry, rice, meat, chicken, fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-26T00:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynelda De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205.42,"local_amount":4279.51,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4293.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874593},{"amount":95.59,"local_amount":1991.36,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1997.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639927},{"amount":100.12,"local_amount":2085.78,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2092.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821711},{"amount":103.65,"local_amount":2159.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561719},{"amount":98.66,"local_amount":2055.52,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770644},{"amount":100.85,"local_amount":2101.12,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204537},{"amount":100.53,"local_amount":2094.45,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2101.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330247},{"amount":100.48,"local_amount":2093.39,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2100.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465417},{"amount":204.2,"local_amount":4254.09,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4267.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097619},{"amount":90.5,"local_amount":1885.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1891.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348284}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T04:00:24Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":175692,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Antonio M. vive en vivienda propia, en la zona German Busch, de la ciudad de El Alto.

Hilda M. is 32 years old and a single woman with four children.  She operates a dairy and lives in an area of Maica Norte, which is a canton of the city of Cochabamba.  Hilda has to raise her children alone because her husband abandoned them a year ago after she became severely ill and had to be hospitalized for six months.  Hilda\u2019s mother stayed with the children while she was in the hospital.  Her fifteen year old daughter quit high school and began working so that she could help her mother recover and pay for the household expenses.  Their bills were numerous since there was no other income besides the milk being sold by Hilda\u2019s mother and children.  After she was discharged from the hospital, Hilda felt guilty that her daughter had to quit school to help her and her children experienced a strong rejection by their father.  Hilda advised them not to mention him again, as if he were dead.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda is requesting a loan to buy two more dairy cows so that she can increase milk production for delivery and to make cheeses to sell at the market.  She feels she has more courage and strength to move her children forward so that they can complete their education.  Her daughter returned to school, but she still helps with gathering the milk and helping her mother in the afternoons make cheeses.  Hilda hopes to improve her income and experience a better standard of living now that they she hasn't accumulated as many expenses as she had a year ago.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda\u2019s mother is very proud of her daughter and granddaughter for persevering and not giving in to everything bad that had happened to them.   Do\u00f1a Carmen (Hilda\u2019s mother) says, \u201cI know my granddaughter will experience success because my daughter will be the one to show her.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nHilda is still in the process of recovery, but she continues to work hard and manage her dairy responsibly.  She begins work at 4am and then prepares her children for school so that they can become professionals and have a better future than her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

She sells these crops in the city of San Francisco.  \r\n\r\nAt harvest time Marcelina hires field workers to speed up the gathering of her crops.  She has been engaged in this business activity for 17 years.  She feels that the most difficult part is taking care of the crops so that they are not subject to insect infestations.\r\n\r\nIn time, she wants to get new land to expand her crops.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  She has always been very punctual with her payments, and she has not caused problems in her communal bank.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy insecticide to combat insect infestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":761296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-02T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2545.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666048}],"funded_date":"2011-05-02T18:22:42Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":299046,"name":"Marcia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcia es socia del  Banco Comunal \u201cNuevo Amanecer\u201d, ubicado en el distrito Juli, provincia Chucuito  y  departamento de Puno, tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene tres hijos.

They have received previous loans from Kiva through SMT that were of great help to these entrepreneurs. The last loan was for Le 800,000 each. They repaid it successfully and are now requesting a new loan for Le 1,000,000 each.\r\n\r\nFatmata (pictured in the middle) is the leader of this group. She was born in Fadugu, about twenty-five miles from Kabala. She is forty and married with five children. Four of her children are in secondary schools and one is in primary school. She pays for their education with proceeds from the market foods she sells in the market. Her husband is now too old to fend for the family so it is incumbent on her to take care of their children. \r\n\r\nFatmata has been in business for over ten years. She sells market food at the Tender Hill market. With this loan, she will invest in market foods like onions, margi (used in sauce), peppers, salts, oil, sugar, and more. She buys most of these items in Kabala town. When they are scarce in Kabala, she will send to Freetown (about 570 round-trip) where prices for the goods are relatively cheaper. With higher profits, Fatmata will be able to assist her children in their education, feeding, and clothing and provide them with medical care when anyone falls sick."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":221490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchasing food for resale in the marketplace.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-11-05T19:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bengali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":111.04,"local_amount":325000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":330626.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5346105},{"amount":316.04,"local_amount":925000,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:19Z","rounded_local_amount":941014.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128876},{"amount":85.41,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":254328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025666},{"amount":264.79,"local_amount":775000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":788417.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008470},{"amount":76.89,"local_amount":225000,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":228895.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662599},{"amount":85.41,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254328.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102834},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":254328.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019873}],"funded_date":"2008-11-10T15:53:07Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":76959,"name":"Seam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Seam K. is 44 years old and lives in Moeun Tom Rang village in Takeo Province.

Her eldest daughter, who has a baby of her own and who is pictured (her mother had gone out to buy merchandise) also helps Mar\u00eda taking care of the business when she needs to go out; thanks to her help she has been able to stock up in order to take care of the customers.  Mar\u00eda enjoys serving her clients very much as it requires a great deal of patience, a quality she has plenty of.  Her store is always busy and the goods she offers sell out quickly.  Because of this she needs to go out to buy more merchandise, during which times she leaves her daughter in charge of the business.  Katherine is very happy to help her mother because the business benefits the entire family and in the future she hopes to continue workings so that her mother's business grows a lot more.

Nasiba is married and the mother of seven children. She is determined to make a better living for the entire family. Nasiba is hardworking and kind, giving her the ideal blend of entrepreneurial determination and service.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

She is 41 years old and married to Donato. She is the mother to two boys. She lives in Jala-jala, Rizal province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nLife was not easy for Sofia, just depending on the insufficient salary of her husband. In 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, hoping to have an opportunity to open a business. Her previous loan was wisely invested in her sari-sari store (general store) business. The store sells smoothly and well but the income from the store is not sufficient to sustain the needs of her family. She needs to think of another business in which to invest her next loan.\r\n\r\nNow Sofia requests a loan of 15,000 as starting capital for her primary business selling rice. The amount will be used to pay for thirty-eight sacks of rice and payment for transportation expenses. From the field, after harvesting rice, farmers will sell rice to her and, for her profit, she will resell it to another businessmen with a much higher price than she paid.\r\n\r\nSofia dreams of having a grocery store someday and space in the market for a retail business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":361585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Eliza C. started with a variety store business when her sister gave her small amount of money for a capital after the death of her husband in 2004. She had two children that goes to school then. One in college and the other is in high school. Profit she had at that time wasn't enough for all expenses required by the education of her children and their personal needs thus, business was sporadic because capital was misused most of the times.\n\nWhen one of her children is graduating from college, the financial need for her education is increasing affecting the stability of her business. Then, she realized she needs loan to sustain the financial need of her business and for making it grow to profit bigger. After paying her previous loans in ASHI, now she wants to loan larger amount for her business. Her two children are helping her in managing her store. One had graduated from college and the other one is highschool undergraduate.  With her family working in the business she put up and with the loans she can avail, someday she envisioned that her business can generate employment in their community. From a variety store she aims to make it a grocery store or a mini-mart in their community.

I. (0) is a 55-year-old woman living in the town of Vaovai.  She is married and has 8 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Siloma owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Siloma has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Siloma joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Siloma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Siloma is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Siloma plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":382312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you) modality and supports her family with a neighborhoold grocery store that at night she turns into a snack bar where she sells such typical dishes as \"salchipapas\" (a type of fast food that consists of thinly sliced pan-fried beef hot dogs or sausage and French fries, mixed together and served on a plate or in a paper cone, served with different sauces) and \"silpanchos\" (a schnitzel-style beef that is served with tomatoes, onions and a base layer of rice. It is often served with fried eggs on top.)  At that time of night, this is the only place in the area where such dishes can be found.  She also owns a minibus which provides her with a daily rental income.  Julia, upon noting that her eatery lacked enough space to accommodate all the customers that came, decided to rent a room which is across the way from her current place of business and furnish it to better serve more customers.

Julita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

Estela as an active member of Paglaum MPC under the Regular Loan Program has successfully repaid a loan of Php 20,000.00. She is now requesting a loan of Php 30,000.00. This 2nd loan will be used to maintain and repair her computers.

His wife currently stays at home to take care of their younger daughter.  Previously, between 2006 and 2008, she operated a consumer goods trading business.\r\n\r\nDavaatseren supports his entire family by operating three separate businesses:  a vegetable growing and trading business, a taxi service, and a mobile dairy retail business. He grows a variety of vegetables to sell to local traders after harvesting them. He started this business in 2003 and has made quick progress. \r\n\r\nAfter years of successful operations, Davaatseren managed to buy a car.

She earns her living by operating a vegetable plantation\/farming.  Her husband Ivan, who is 54 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have no children. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for house improvements and prepare for her future.  L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This is the case of Rochelle, 32. Rochelle graduated from high school, but was not able to continue to college. At present, she is a single mom to one child, whom she loves and cares for dearly. They live in Pasay City with Rochelle\u2019s other family members. Rochelle is also active in her role as a community partner in CCT. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nRochelle has a store where she cooks meals for customers and sells varieties of daily essentials, from toiletries to instant food. The store is located adjacent to their house for efficient management on her side as she serves her fellow community members. Rochelle has stayed long in the business, and her family helps her in managing the store. She earns around 15, 000 PHP in terms of monthly net income.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain her business, which is the primary source of her income, Rochelle applies for a 13,000 PHP loan. Purchasing necessary goods for her store is the main use of this loan. She plans to buy meat, fish, and vegetables to come up with delicious, healthy meals which her customers would surely love. She will also purchase stocks of seasonings, dairy products, and toiletries to meet the needs of her customers. Rochelle says that the loan helps her meet the daily needs of her family, as well as the finances needed for the education of her child.\r\n\r\nRochelle confesses that competition is her toughest challenge at present. There are a lot of stores having the same products that she has, and so she finds it hard to elicit loyalty among her customers. Sometimes the meals she cooked were not all sold, and she was forced to lower the price just to call it a day. But Rochelle never entertains the thought of defeat because her life\u2014and the life of her family\u2014hinges on the success of her business. This is where she will draw money for the medication of her child, the payment of the house bills, and much more. That is why her prayer is for her business to grow profitably and for her family to stay strong and united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":779609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has been with his partner for almost 24 years, and together they educate and raise their children in the warmth of their humble home. Emilio learned farming from his parents. Most of the people in his community are in agriculture, and he does not fall behind. He grows potatoes, peas, beans, and barley. Additionally, he has 50 sheep, 2 cows, and 2 horses. He also has small animals like chickens and guinea pigs. Besides buying and selling animals, he also makes an extra income. Regarding problems with his crops, he states that freezing temperatures did much damage during the month of August. \"Winning or risking, that's what this job is about,\" he adds. However, because of the perseverance that he is characterized by, he will continue with his crops, which he loves as if they were a part of him. With the profits that he generates in the future, he will obtain more young bulls, which he will raise then sell. Also, he will expand his crops with the aim of providing his children with an education from the best schools in the city. This is the eighth time that Emilio obtains a loan from MFP. He likes working with his communal bank because its members are very united, and because many of them are his relatives. With this money, he plans to purchase sacks of fertilizer (bird guano), to pay the fee to transport his produce to the city, and to pay his farm workers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":898448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer, and to pay for crop transportation costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-18T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1836.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097856}],"funded_date":"2011-10-19T14:12:38Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":352367,"name":"John Wady","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A sus 38 a\u00f1os de edad, John es un hombre casado y con un hijo de 12 a\u00f1os, viven en el municipio de Guarne en el departamento de Antioquia y tienen una peque\u00f1a fabrica productora de arepas all\u00ed mismo. \n\nPese a que la competencia en su municipio es muy dura, John sue\u00f1a con montar toda una industria de la arepa all\u00ed, para que todos reconozcan su marca y sus arepas, pero es conciente que para esto necesita fortalecer m\u00e1s muchas \u00e1reas como conseguir nuevos mercados.

Married and the mother of two children, she has been selling canned goods, sacks of rice, and drums of vegetable oil since 2005 in her shop that she has named ETS AKS ALBATROS.  Her first loan of 350,000 francs CFA enable her to stock up enough inventory to avoid incessant round-trips to the Grand Market in Lom\u00e9.  And it also enables her to back away from supplier loans, which don't allow her to earn enough.  In addition, the volume of customer traffic is now better, and her customer base has grown to an adequate level.  With regard to sales growth and to customer needs, she is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs CFA to buy twelve 25-kg sacks of rice and eight cartons of canned goods in order to grow her revenue, which would allow her to help with family expenses.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<b><p> \r\n\r\nMadame A.

Four years ago she started raising chickens in a small area built behind her house, she then takes them to the market and sells them for the best offer.  What she likes about her job is raising good chickens so that her clients have no complaints about size or weight.  This is a profitable business because in approximately 35 days the chickens are ready for sale.  The difficult part of her job is not having an appropriate location, because the small area in her house is not suitable to properly raise the chickens.  With MFP she has two loans, she likes to work with the community bank because everyone is responsible and helpful.  The money now requested is to be invested in buying baby chickens as well as feed to raise them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":303441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy feed and chickens to raise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-15T21:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":168.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":175.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":181.2},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":192.23},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":197.98},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":206.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":213.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.4},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.08},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.72},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.18,"local_amount":165.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":170.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012436},{"amount":56.11,"local_amount":168.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":173.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596025},{"amount":58.43,"local_amount":175.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":180.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990289},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":181.2,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":186.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211414},{"amount":64.08,"local_amount":192.23,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":198,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640923},{"amount":65.99,"local_amount":197.98,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":203.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080390},{"amount":68.72,"local_amount":206.17,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":212.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996573},{"amount":71.08,"local_amount":213.24,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":219.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842073}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T21:50:01Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":105647,"name":"Justina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Justina tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad y est\u00e1 casada con el se\u00f1or Mariano Fernandez.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(0) is a 40 years-year-old woman living in the town of Lotofaga Aleipata A.  She is married and has 6 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Patilisi owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Patilisi has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 620 tala WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2006, Patilisi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Patilisi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 tala WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Patilisi is now requesting a new loan of 2200 tala WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Patilisi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Later, he got married and moved to live in Potrero Nuevo which is a community in the municipality of Ignacio de la Llave.  He has always been a fisherman, which is a very common occupation in the region since there are several lakes and a river in his community.  At the beginning he started working as a driver but, due to an accident, he had to change jobs and started raising cows.  Alternating with this activity he fished which has yielded very good results since he sells his fish among his community.  He buys all kinds of seafood such as mojarra (a small, broad fish), tilapia, chucumite (fat snook), shrimp, octopus, crab, snail, oyster, etc.  Carlos's goal it to build a stand in his yard from which to sell his wares and he is requesting a loan to buy the seafood and then to build a floor and roof so that his merchandise will be more presentable than currently possible with a board in the open air in his yard.\n\nHe is the group representative of the group called LA MOJARRA which is made up of 4 ladies and himself.  The ladies are involved in other activvities such as the sale of shoes, purses, and catalogue perfume sales. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":410429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To build a stall from which to sell fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, VER.

In the future, he would like to have a line of tyre patch repairmen for his sons to work on.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Stephen Bayley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":477286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Compressor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-01-26T02:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson Cosme","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":480,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":72.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.06},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.06,"local_amount":72.06,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":75.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910121},{"amount":80.89,"local_amount":77.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945686},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":78.63,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":81.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674049},{"amount":84.2,"local_amount":80.83,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":84.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708206},{"amount":177.95,"local_amount":170.83,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891407}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T03:41:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephen Bayley","image":null}},{"id":175724,"name":"Fermin De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ferm\u00edn de Jes\u00fas Hern\u00e1ndez, Labora como Higienista en el Mercado Mayoreo de Managua.\n\n El tiene cuatro hijos a su cargo, y tres de ellos se  encuentran en  edad escolar, es ajuntado, ha trabajado  cr\u00e9ditos con CEPRODEL durante diez a\u00f1os, en este periodo de tiempo ha invertido quince cr\u00e9dito en la mejoramiento de la vivienda en la que habita, gracias a los financiamiento otorgados por CEPRODEL.\n El cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para invertir en la compra de materiales de construcci\u00f3n como: cemento, arena y piso para la casa ya que anteriormente solo ten\u00eda concreto.\nFerm\u00edn dijo que gracias a los financiamientos otorgados por ceprodel  a hora cuenta de seguridad y una mejor condici\u00f3n de vida a sus hijos. \n","en":"Ferm\u00edn works as a custodian in the Mercado Mayoreo in Managua.\r\n\r\nHe has four children, three of which are school-aged.

Not being able to stay in school for very long because of lack of means, he enrolled in a woodworking training workshop. In 1982, at the end of his training, he opened a woodworking workshop.  Very enterprising, he has a large clientele and does his work quickly and very responsibly. His weekly sales range from 50,000 to 450,000 francs.  With the loan that he expects to receive, he is going to buy boards, such as plywood, beams, lathes, nails, glue and everything needed to build furniture. Very ambitious, he has big plans for the future: to open a large workshop and a furniture display shop.   He also plans to support his children while they obtain a university education and to think about building a large house for his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at retail rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 350 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest a portion of the loan in purchasing raw ingredients for her viands like meat, vegetables, seasonings, and other similar items. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarilyn dreams to be able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rosita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional grocery stock.\r\n\r\nRosita is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will again be used to purchase additional grocery stock.

This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Maricel, as she herself has finished college and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nMaricel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Maricel earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaricel hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to have her own house and lot in a prominent subdivision in a nice location. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She offers these treats to her neighbors.    Maria enjoys combining different ingredients to come up with new flavors.  At first she was unsure whether she could learn how to bake, but over time she has come to enjoy this passion and now produces delicious sweets that are in great demand.  Her business generates good profits, which allows her to help with the household expenses.  What bothers Mar\u00eda is not having a place to sell her desserts.  For the moment, she produces sweets based on orders and the work is not easy.  Since she is a hardworking and enterprising woman, Mar\u00eda plans in the future to have a store where she can sell different items and also be able to offer her desserts with greater peace of mind.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  Mar\u00eda is careful to be responsible with each of her payments.  With the money being requested, she plans to buy ingredients in bulk for making desserts as well as molds for designing new cakes so that she can generate more income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is married and does not yet have any children due to a health problem, but she thinks she might like to be a mother in the future.\n\nJessica's husband is originally from the city of Esmeraldas, but moved to Manabi province when they married. He has his own cabinet-making workshop, where he makes finely finished doors, tables and other items. He also has a moving truck, so he is often hired to work outside the city. Jessica has a professional degree in mathematical physics, but she has never worked in this field. However, she has never sat still, and took the initiative to start selling Avon products and open a store in her home. She has been selling Avon products for the past 2 years, and travels throughout the city to sell items on credit to her friends and acquaintances. \n\nWith this loan, Jessica will invest in her businesses. She will use part of the money to buy Avon products like perfume, shampoo and makeup, and the other part to buy more merchandise for her store (like rice, sugar, oil, and other necessary products). Her dreams is to expand her business so that she can earn more in profits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Staff<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":556958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy makeup, shampoo, perfume, rice and sugar ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":183.32,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":183.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632944},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846978},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113438},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407042},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407043},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388149},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388150}],"funded_date":"2010-07-11T21:28:22Z","paid_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":213038,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda C. es socia del banco comunal Buscando el \u00c9xito, vive por el sector del mercado 12 de Abril en la ciudad de Cuenca, esta ciudad es reconocida por su belleza arquitect\u00f3nica, sus iglesias, su gastronom\u00eda y muchos encantos m\u00e1s que hacen de esta una ciudad especial.\n\nNuestra socia tiene de 53 a\u00f1os de edad es madre soltera y con su trabajo ha logrado criar a sus 5 hijos quienes  ya son todos mayores de edad, 2 casados y 3 solteros todos trabajan y viven de manera independiente,  sus hijos le ayudan econ\u00f3micamente, no tiene  casa propia por lo que vive arrendando.\n\nLa Se\u00f1ora.
