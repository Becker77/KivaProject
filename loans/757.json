The official name of this borrowing group is Hilaria R..\r\n\r\nHilaria is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she prepares and sells cooked food for daily meals. She has been engaged in her business for over thirty years and earns approximately $92 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Hilaria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is Elvira A.'s Group.\r\n<br>Elvira is 49 years old, married and has eight school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from tending a canteen near the school. Elvira has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Elvira joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elvira is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her tenth from ASKI.

She lives in Barranquilla, where she has had a hairdresser and beauty salon since 2000, when she graduated from a beauty academy.  She initially did haircuts, manicures, pedicures, and styling for her friends from home.  Over time, people began to seek her out, and, through word of mouth, she built up a full-time business. She loves her line of work, especially the make-up, which is her strong point.  Both her children, now working professionals, and her husband always help her with expenses, as they are a close family. This is her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will use it to buy a mirror, a barber's chair and a hair-washing basin.  This will make her clients more comfortable.

They live together in the small town of Canayre, where they have a rented house.\r\n\r\nRolando says that when he was a child he always wanted to excel economically, and this is why he has been working as a traveling salesman since he was 17 years old. When he finished school, he worked at a sewage project, which is where he made the capital that he used to buy merchandise and begin traveling among the markets, which are his points of sale. This is how Rolando sells his products, and he is proud of his good earnings. In the near future he wants to establish himself in the town, where he can have his own house and open a store in it. Then he would not be traveling from market to market since that has many disadvantages, and sometimes the products deteriorate because of the long trip Rolando makes.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan, so he is committed to making his payments on time. With the 1,500 new soles, Rolando will buy more varied products, including items for the home, so he can stock his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":915435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy household products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-13T00:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rolando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":123.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":133.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":148.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":151.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":158.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":162.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":174.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":265.25,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":275.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836091},{"amount":49.6,"local_amount":129.38,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":134.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245851},{"amount":110.96,"local_amount":289.47,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":300.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098971},{"amount":57.94,"local_amount":151.16,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":156.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713105},{"amount":60.63,"local_amount":158.15,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":164.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202072},{"amount":62.29,"local_amount":162.49,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097890},{"amount":131.9,"local_amount":344.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:34Z","rounded_local_amount":357.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400727}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T19:37:48Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":361064,"name":"Demetria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Demetria es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cCandelaria\u201d del centro poblado Poccona, distrito y provincia D.

This is thirty-year-old Salima from Dar es Salaam. She is married with four children under the age of fifteen. She is also financially responsible for another child who is a relative. Salima owns and runs a stall from which she sells essential grocery items. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. <P>A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>Additionally, Salima has capitalized on Dar es Salaam\u2019s proximity to the Indian Ocean and the fondness of its residents for fish to sell roasted fish at her genge. This helps her earn some extra income. She currently makes US$ 90 per month from sales at her genge. <P>Salima is requesting a loan of US$ 225 to purchase additional fish, cooking oil, and cooking fuel for her stall. She is hopeful that selling more fish will help her earn higher profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":191864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies in bulk for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T00:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T01:56:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":23,"local_amount":25555.56,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26749,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356199},{"amount":22,"local_amount":24444.44,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25586,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347941},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970515},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886732},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435992},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130290},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:09Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027121},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613161},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010244},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":26167.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232555}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T01:56:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65174,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth G. operates a grocery store in her neighborhood.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Cecilia is a single mother and the little help she gets comes from her two oldest sons who work and study.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":431875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy sand and cement to finish building her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T00:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia Argentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.96,"local_amount":839.14,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":869.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003242},{"amount":42.8,"local_amount":856,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":886.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841399},{"amount":86.76,"local_amount":1735.16,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874314},{"amount":90.01,"local_amount":1800.28,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1865.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639672},{"amount":46.73,"local_amount":934.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":968.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821448},{"amount":91.74,"local_amount":1834.77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1901.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561460}],"funded_date":"2009-11-22T20:03:48Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":159627,"name":"Jeanny Marivil","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia JEANNY MARIVIL hace un a\u00f1o que pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPROSPERIDAD\u201d  \n\nNuestra socia es una joven madre de familia, tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, tienen dos hijos y esta embarazada.

R., 31, lives with her husband and their four children in a community called Ca\u00f1o Negro.  It is located in Los Chiles in the Alajuela province.  This area is in a mountainous region near the northern border of the country. The main economic activities are livestock breeding and agriculture, specifically the planting and harvesting of basic grains, sugar cane, and oranges.\n\nKarla has worked in a hotel for a little over two months.  She says that she now has a source of income, which helps her husband with the household expenses.  But, she says, her work is pretty far from her house.  It is difficult for her to get there because there is very little public transportation and her schedule rotates.  Sometimes she needs to wait a long time to find transportation. \n\nTherefore, Karla has decided to buy a motorcycle to be better able to get places.  That way she will speed up the way she travels, and she will be able to save and take advantage of having more time.  To do this she needs a loan for \u00a2654,000 (six hundred fifty four thousand colones) to buy the motorcycle.  That way she will be able to have her own vehicle, which will allow her to get ahead and facilitate her form of travel.\n\nKarla is part of the Emcrecoba Communal Finance Institution, one the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her second loan, and with the loan she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  She also plans on actively participating in the loan organization in her community.\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She will use the requested loan to buy some products for her business so she can always fulfill her customers' requests.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":506645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy vegetables, oil, flour, soft drinks, beer, baked goods, meats, fruits, charcoal, cloth, thread, yeast","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Luque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.266667 -57.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eustacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obtaciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciriaca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":12680935,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1056745},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1056740}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1375,"local_amount":6340470,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6365111.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128951406},{"amount":916.67,"local_amount":4226980,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4243407.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136680096},{"amount":458.33,"local_amount":2113485,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2121698.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714495}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T05:56:41Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":188941,"name":"Johana Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Johana tiene 22 a\u00f1os, y vive en casa de su suegra hace 3 a\u00f1os aproximadamente ya que \nconviv\u00eda con el padre de su menor hija; actualmente se encuentra separada de \u00e9l sin \nembargo a pesar de ello recibe el apoyo de sus suegros en cuanto a vivienda y \nalimentaci\u00f3n.

She is 23 years old and single. To make a living, Mildred owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Mildred has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP when she sells one of the animals she has raised.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mildred joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.

She was born in the San Miguel district. She lives with her husband, Cirilo, who is 33, and they have five children. They live in their own house in the community of Palmapampa, which is an annex of the Samugari district. Felicitas and her husband Cirilo are the support of their family. From the time when Felicitas was a very young girl, her parents taught her to work on the farm. Now she is a farmer and has three hectares of land planted with achiote, cacao, coca leaves, and peanuts, which are plants that are native to the forest zone of the Apurimac River valley. She has been working her own land for 12 years, and the part she likes most is the harvest. During this time she needs the help of others, and she needs to hire day workers to make progress with the harvesting of her crops. At the end, she feels that the months of hard work have offered her repayment in the quality of her products. She finds that the most difficult part is transporting her products from the fields to the city of San Francisco, the place where they offer her better prices for her crops and coca leaves. In the future she wants to buy new land to increase her cultivation. \n\nThis is her 11th loan with MFP, and she knows that if she pays it on time, she will be able to access another loan with great ease and without bringing complications to her community bank. With the 3000 PEN that she is applying for, she will buy fertilizers and insecticides to improve her plantings and thus obtain good crops.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":707071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar fertilizantes e insecticidas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-09T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicitas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3044.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665806}],"funded_date":"2011-02-11T08:45:54Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":274987,"name":"Sakina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina is a member of this group loan.

Lilibeth, 46, realizes this truth and makes sure she and her family live their lives at the maximum. She finished only the first year in high school. At present, she works hard in business to make up for what she lacks in education. Her husband Policarpio, a vendor, works hard too. They have two children, one of whom is already working, while the younger one studies in college.  Together, they live in Parola Area, Binondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nLilibeth manages her own sari-sari (variety) store. Here, she sells daily household essentials and sells rice in retail. Lilibeth also raises hogs for a living.  These businesses are all managed and operated near their home. Lilibeth has worked these businesses for 12 years now. With the help of one delivery boy, she makes around Php1, 000 net income daily.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her business, Lilibeth applies for a Php26, 000 loan. She will use this money to purchase additional grocery items for her store.  She will also purchase at least four hogs for slaughter and sell. Lilibeth says that this loan will definitely increase her capacity to earn. With the incoming profits, she plans to allocate funds to what is needed in her business: materials needed for hog raising, replenishment of stocks in her store, and more. She also plans to avail herself of government services for health and insurance to keep her and her family in good shape.\r\n\r\nLike many micro-entrepreneurs, Lilibeth also has her share of periods of low sales, especially during summertime when people go out of town or prefer to stay home all day. But still she refuses to settle for anything less than a life lived to the fullest. She desires to achieve success in business and see that her children will also become successful. Lilibeth hopes to have a vacation in their home province in Cebu.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":772368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":925533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She is the chairwoman of the local community self help group called Yetana (translates as \"supporting one another\") which educates the locals on poverty eradication. \r\n\r\nTwice a week, Hamida travels over 60 km to sell her produce on the busy route between Busia and Malaba.  With the loan of $ 150 from PEMCI, she plans to increase her tomato stock, and to also buy cereals during this harvest season to sell later. Hamida hopes that with an increase in profit she will be able to purchase a chicken and sheep to feed her family and sell eggs.  She strives to give her daughter a better life than she had, including supporting her through a high level of education.  With her business, she has been able to supply the community with fresh vegetables and also provide for her family.

Gulmurat is 37 years old. He is married and has three children who are studying at school. The gentleman is a vegetable producer with more than 10 years of experience. He works all day on the plantations and he is involved in the whole production process, including post-harvest tasks and selling the vegetables. \r\n<p>\r\nIt is relevant to explain that the production of vegetables requires adequate fertilizer to generate the expected harvest. Nutrients and chemical fertilizers are needed throughout the process. Currently Gulmurat is having difficulties getting into the market with his product because he doesn't have enough organic matter to incorporate into the soil. There isn\u2019t enough fertilizer and the soils are poor in nutrients. It is for these reasons that his harvests aren\u2019t going well. He lacks the capital to be able to correctly prepare the plantations and thereby achieve a successful harvest. He is hoping for your generosity and is very thankful to all of you. \r\n<p> \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p> \r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p> \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p> \r\nIMON's History\r\n<p> \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 33 years old. Marivic is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marivic owns & operates a food stall. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling vegetables & spices. Marivic has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP (about 150 US dollars) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marivic joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional vegetables & spices. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will also be used to purchase vegetables & spices. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marivic from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family & children's education. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This situation led to it\u2019s being able to take in the \u201cLuz del Alba\u201d (Dawn\u2019s Light) association.  This communal association was organized in a new housing area that still does not have electricity or running water.  The members have stated that no other financial institution was willing to extend them credit, or to trust them.  They, on the other hand, are limited because they are unable to have capital or develop their businesses.\r\n\r\nThe members are in a variety of commercial activities, such as: shirt and skirt making, candy sales, pastry making, sale of spices, egg sales, neighborhood grocery store, and photocopy services.\r\n\r\nJanett M., married and the mother of two children, tells us that she has a skirt and shirt-making shop.  She learned these skills by helping her sister-in-law and they currently work together.\r\n\r\nShe works based on prior orders.  She indicates that usually groups called \u2018comparsas\u2019 (theater or dance troupe) request traditional costumes to dance at special events (municipal anniversaries, labor union special days, etc.)  She then must buy fabric and make the shirts and skirts as well as the macram\u00e9 trim for the skirts.  The shirts and skirts must all be identical for every woman that dances in the troupe and the color and design must be different from year to year.  This is why each artisan puts in so much effort for her customers and why a significant amount of capital is required to make these costumes.\r\n\r\n\u201cLuz del Alba\u201d is made up of 9 members.

Angelina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional baby livestock to raise & sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Angelina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Malinong, Brgy. Miranda, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental.  She earns her living by operating a passenger transport business. Her husband, Jose S., who is 50 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 17 to 28 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nConsolacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Consolacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to buy a tricycle so that she can continue to save for future home repairs and business expansion. \r\n<p>\r\nConsolacion S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. (Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable.) Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Melisio, 31 years old, works as a fisherman to earn a living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They live in Purok Tuway in Barangay Canmoros, located within Binalbagan municipality in Negros Occidental province, Visayas islands. Venus operates two business ventures, a general store and a fishing business. \r\n<p>\r\nVenus joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past thirteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Venus has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nFor this, her 14th loan cycle, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Venus M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

one's odds at business success are minimal.

Smith, who is happily married with 6 kids, has thrived in his food sales business, courtesy of his diligence, resilience and determination. His honesty, too, has been invaluable the last 9 years. Smith mostly sells beans, maize and coffee in food markets in Ntungamo. Weekly he says his business generates him shillings of 250,000 as profit. \r\n\r\nSmith says being a farmer has come in really handy especially during times when there is a  food crisis in Uganda. He says demand for his crops increases and as such he is able to make more sales profit. With this loan, Smith says he is going to purchase high-grade manure for his farming and gardens.

loan cycle through Esperanza International, Kiva's partner. Brigida has four grown-up children; three female and one male. The females are all Esperanza clients through microloans. \r\n<p>\r\nBrigida has a small cafeteria at a local school. Right now she is facing a problem: She doesn\u2019t have anything to keep the drinks she sells cold, so she has to buy ice blocks for this purpose. Sometimes the kids at the school don\u2019t want to buy the water, juices and soft drinks she sells because they\u2019re not cold, which is necessary in a tropical country like the Dominican Republic. So Brigida will use this loan to buy a freezer where she can store the drinks. She has already seen one that is on sale for a good price, she says. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen the school is closed, Brigida sells fried Johnny cakes and drinks at her house. In time, she would like to have her own colmado (convenience\/grocery store) so she can sell in the same place permanently. \r\n<p>\r\nThank you for supporting these entrepreneurs!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":284868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy

He is 48-years old and blessed with six children: Eva \u2013 28, college graduate; Freddie \u2013 26, college graduate; Anamarie - 24 years old and also a college graduate; Adelyne \u2013 19, first year college; Mario - 14 years old, sophomore in high school and John Paul - 3-years old. Pablo and his wife hope that they will be able to support their younger children, who have ambitions to finish college someday.\r\n<p>\r\nPablo doesn\u2019t have enough capital to improve his tricycle. Thus, he wants to borrow 5,000 PHP to be used for motorcycle maintenance. He wants to improve his motorcycle's running condition, to make sure that his passengers are always safe. With this strategy, Pablo believes that he will be able to increase his daily income from his transportation service, and provide his children with allowances, and his wife with money to maintain her hog raising business. Pablo is getting older but, as long as he is strong enough, he will continue to do his best to satisfy his family's daily

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

A cousin told our client about our services, and she came to us to request a loan in the amount of 10,000 meticals to improve her business. She has been successful.

She travels once a month and has the best products (sugar, rice, and beverages). She makes 4000 meticals profit each month and saves 1000 meticals, since she has the help of two employees and of her husband, who raises cattle and owns 32 head.

Rosa dreams of: building her home out of good material, as the material that she has is rustic; and to offer her youngest children a good education.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":566074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"for the purchase of a new cart","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2010-07-12T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":176.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159630094},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":176.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166844140},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":176.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172110318},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-01T11:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":176.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177403547},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-25T10:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":176.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542064},{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-16T10:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":176.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188678860}],"funded_date":"2010-07-12T03:13:18Z","paid_date":"2011-01-16T10:00:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":217651,"name":"Ikhbol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her store is located nearby to her rented basement apartment, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local residents. Her store is in a good location and it is close to all amenities.\r\n\r\nHer husband Boldbaatar has a family car and uses it for delivering goods from wholesale points to the store. Their future dream is to have their own family house and to give a proper education to their kids.\r\n\r\nThe loan they are requesting will be used to replace their old family car with a newer one in better condition.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":617016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She wanted to sell something, but wasn\u2019t sure what.  By observing her nieces, who were always buying accessories such as pins, belts and barrettes, she got the idea to start selling these types of products.  She first started selling to her acquaintances, offering all types of accessories for young girls.  She also devised the idea to copy styles out of catalogs, and sell them at lower prices.  With a great deal of hard work, she was able to strengthen her business.  She now has a large customer base, and this has allowed her to buy some items that she needed for her house.  \r\n\r\nHowever, she considers educating her children to be of utmost importance.  She is now thinking about making pet\u2019s clothing, since another passion of hers is knitting.  She makes ponchos, scarves, and swimsuits.  Not long ago she knitted some samples that were taken to the U.S. by a relative, and she is now receiving orders for some of her items.  For this reason, she is thinking about starting this type of new business.  She plans to use the loan from EDAPROSPO to buy thread so she can dedicate herself to this business that she is just starting, and knows she has a bright future ahead.\r\n\r\n* Carmen is in the middle of the group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":626477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase thread to make pet's clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Jhonatan Johan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Casilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Kathy Mayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guiullianna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Frank Aron","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":613},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":613},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":613},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":611}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.18},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225.18,"local_amount":613,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":627.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529224},{"amount":225.19,"local_amount":613,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":627.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665332},{"amount":225.18,"local_amount":613,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":627.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408575},{"amount":224.45,"local_amount":611,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":625.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826867}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T19:56:26Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":246339,"name":"Sabine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabine Y. is 38 years old  and a mother to two boys.

Her great spirit, strong will and hard work have allowed her to improve the quality of her life and life of her family.  \r\n\r\nSarana is an internally displaced woman who suffered and lost everything in 1993 during the war. She had to create everything from nothing in a new place and new land. After she was dislocated to Bilasuvar city (her present place of living) she decided to continue the work of her life, which is raising sheep and cattle. \r\n\r\nFor the past 30 years, this persevering woman has been working very hard at raising and selling sheep and lambs, and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her beloved daughter, who is her greatest joy. \r\n\r\nSarana asks for a loan of 1,000 AZN  in order to buy more young sheep to sell later when they are fully grown. With this investment she will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":734107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 12 sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Bilasuvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.5 48.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2011-03-19T13:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"  Sarana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.97,"local_amount":82.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T07:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206372588},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-22T07:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":84.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212093187},{"amount":107.06,"local_amount":83.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216449839},{"amount":105.28,"local_amount":82.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":83.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221613970},{"amount":107.9,"local_amount":84.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":85.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226983287},{"amount":104.77,"local_amount":82.17,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232742472},{"amount":105.57,"local_amount":82.8,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":83.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238547040},{"amount":105.66,"local_amount":82.87,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244506579},{"amount":106.6,"local_amount":83.61,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:19:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250714081},{"amount":105.53,"local_amount":82.77,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257117003},{"amount":215.41,"local_amount":168.95,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":170.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263242116}],"funded_date":"2011-03-19T18:59:09Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:29:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":287316,"name":"Eduard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eduard M. lives with his wife and two children in Stepanavan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

en su modesta vivienda ubicada en un balneario al norte de Lima. Hace 8 a\u00f1os tiene una tienda de productos comestibles, al principio s\u00f3lo ayudaba a su suegra, pues el negocio era de ella. Pero despu\u00e9s de un tiempo, como la se\u00f1ora ya no pod\u00eda atender su tienda debido a su avanzada edad, Marleni decidi\u00f3 tomar la posta. A ella le gusta mucho atender su tienda, ya que es su propia jefa en el negocio y lo considera rentable por la variedad de comestibles que puede ofrecer a su clientela. Su principal dificultad es en el momento que debe ir a comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, ya que debe cerrar porque no hay otra persona quien se quede. Para el futuro piensa incrementar los productos su tienda para poder satisfacer las m\u00faltiples necesidades de sus clientes. \nEste es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y sabe que debe ser puntual en sus pagos, ya que los miembros de su banco comunal lo son y no piensa defraudarlos.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Sina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sina has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately $550 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Sina has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  Sina is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST which will again be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Sina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nSina is not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His goal is to build a new cinema and to import new video discs to improve his business, to educate his child and to build a house for his family.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Baccus is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.

She and her family live in a rented house in the town of Huaricolca.  Every day she leaves early to work in her fields because the midday heat is unbearable, thereby making it more difficult to work.  The crops she grows are <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulluco<\/a>, potatoes, beans, and oats.  Adelaida has been working in this manner for 17 years.  She also raises animals such as sheep, pigs, and donkeys.  The donkeys help to transport the farming tools that she uses during the day.  She greatly enjoys her work, especially when she sells the harvested crops that she brings to the city of Oroya where the better known wholesalers buy her products.  With her savings, she was able to purchase a vehicle.  In the future she hopes to buy another car that is more modern and spacious to help with distributing her products.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eleventh loan with MFP.

Dalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. Dalia is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be Dalia's eighth loan  from PMPC.

She lives in a traditional family in the Pelnengana district in S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali). Mariam has dropped out of school in the eighth grade (within Mali's educational system) in order to work as a vendor of food condiments. She started working together with her mother, who used to sell fish. After several years of apprenticeship, she has learned the ropes of her trade. At present she sells condiments as well as dried fish, at the Chateau market. She has been in this business for seven years, and enjoys a good business reputation and customer following. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase her working capital with the double goal of meeting customer demand and bolstering her business, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso, and has now been a member for 24 months. After two individual loans, duly reimbursed, she is now on her third individual loan she plans to use to buy three boxes of tomato concentrate, packs of  drued onions, baobab leaves etc. She stocks up in Siribala and Niono. Mariam sells for cash and on credit to a customer base composed mainly of women. With this loan, she plans to achieve a monthly benefit of 100,000 West African francs, which will be used to cover some family expenses. Her goal is to own a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":772482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-05-20T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750913},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120223},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882068},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699162},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655432},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874255},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283047},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-05T08:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424464},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139781},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50567.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756876}],"funded_date":"2011-05-22T19:30:14Z","paid_date":"2012-05-22T08:39:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":303724,"name":"Joice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joice is 30 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

That\u2019s why she has to be persistent in order to recover her investment.\r\n<p>\r\nOver the years, she has gotten along very well with her customers since thanks to them and to her sales she has been an award winning beauty consultant, and that has motivated her to continue working at the job.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP and during previous loans she has been very punctual with her payments.  Also, she is an efficient and very well regarded secretary of the board of directors of her communal bank.  The money which she is now applying for will be used for increasing her stock of products, especially perfumes, because she says that with these products she obtains better profits.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":403531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase of inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T16:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672630}],"funded_date":"2009-10-15T17:18:13Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":147278,"name":"Antoine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antoine U. is 30 years old, is married with one child, and he takes care of five dependents.

Uganda.  She is married and has 3 children, 2 of whom are in school. Slivia has been running a business selling snacks such as sausages for one year. To help expand her business, Slivia is requesting a loan of 200,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda, which will be used to buy more meat. Slivia hopes that the loan will help her by allowing her to expand her business. In the future, Slivia hopes to open up another business such as cosmetics.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She is 32 years old. Corazon is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Corazon owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Corazon has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP when she sells her raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Corazon joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Corazon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. Corazon is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Corazon from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

women who dedicate themselves fully to their small businesses. All of these women previously did not have enough capital to improve their businesses, but today thanks to the working businesswomen's group program and the little capital provided by Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya they have an opportunity to earn more income for their families. \n\nThe woman are very grateful to the foundation for the support of such importance it provides. \n\nThe members are now finishing their sixth loan cycle over the past year and seven months. One of the members is Norma, who makes a living selling varied food and beverage products such as mat\u00e9, oil, canned goods, bread products and other items. This business has really helped her with family expenses, so she wishes to invest in herself and take advantage of the income by improving her business and expanding and buying more products to sell. She tells us she is very satisfied with the group and the help she receives from her fellow members has been been very important for her, since she has progressed so much not just economically but also in valuing the relationships with her fellow women, and she wishes to stay in the group. \n\nNorma is requesting the loan to purchase beverages, meat, oil, baked goods, canned goods and other items.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental, earns her living by conducting three  ventures: a pig-fattening business, a therapy practice, and a general store. Her husband, Leonardo N., 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  <p>\r\n\r\nThelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Thelma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000  to purchase feed and vitamins for the pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future of their family's needs. Thelma N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a community member who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our team.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":644352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase feed and vitamins for pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Kabankalan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T14:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thelma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1923},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1924}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":148.35,"local_amount":6450,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:09:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6471.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182593274},{"amount":117.02,"local_amount":5088,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5104.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188729780},{"amount":176.92,"local_amount":7692,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7717.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191467742},{"amount":132.71,"local_amount":5770,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5788.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196030428}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T19:09:02Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:52:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":254567,"name":"Boris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Boris S. has been trading in tires since 2000.
