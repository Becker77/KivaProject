Turdikul will pay back his loan over 11 months.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0430\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432

May has been engaged in her business for some years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, May joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. May is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by May from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":451622,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

No matter how busy Merlinda is with her business, she makes sure that she has time to attend to her family's needs, be it at home or in the schools of her children. <P>\r\n\r\nAside from her family, Merlinda\u2019s other inspiration is the opportunity of having been trusted with a loan through ASHI, KIva field partner in the Philippines. Through credit she has accessed since the time she became a member, her dream of having a fishing and fish-selling business has eventually came true. It started off very small and little by little, after each loan, it has grown and has been helping many fishermen in their village. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough Merlinda\u2019s loan she can buy a large volume of fish caught by other fishermen in their village.  Using a motorcycle driven by her husband, she sells the fish in other villages of their remote municipality in the province of Antique. Her customers from the two neighboring municipalities come to their house to buy tons of fish to sell once Merlinda calls them and informs them that she has plenty of fish. This happens about four times a week.<P>\r\n\r\nMerlinda\u2019s motorcycle is being paid for in installments every month. However, Merlinda would like to fully pay her remaining balance to maximize her profit in growing her business. Therefore, she is requesting a larger loan for that purpose; some of it will be used for additional capital since growing a business needs bigger capital. <P>\r\n\r\nDespite being a woman, Merlinda also goes fishing in the sea together with her husband, wanting to achieve her dreams of giving her children and grand-children a better life. She hopes that through her business proceeds she will be able to complete the house she and her husband are building for themselves, and that someday all of their kids will graduate from college and have their own careers and not the hard life she and her husband have had since birth.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":477707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

He has been doing this for eight years and what he enjoys most about his work is harvesting the coffee, which he does with great enthusiasm.  His greatest challenge is caring for his plantation, so that they are not affected by blights.  He would eventually like to buy a car so that he can transport his product to their points of sale.\r\n\r\nThis will be his third loan through MFP and he is prepared to make his payments on time and has already begun to save his money.  He is a jolly member of his communal bank and will use the money from this loan to hire field hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":548519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-04T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ronald ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":533.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326753},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":533.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270307}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T18:04:02Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Her main clients are the families who live in and around the neighborhood, as well as educational institutions from all over the city, for whom she makes ID cards, photographic memorabilia, photo printing, really everything that recalls a human being's pleasant or nostalgic moments in life. This is why she always pays close attention to dates of graduation, first Communions, and other social and family reunions that her clients invest in. Her greatest challenge is to buy a flash lighting system and umbrellas to give her photos higher quality; she could also use better printers and laminating machines.

She earns her living by selling ready to wear clothing. Her husband John, who is 30 years old, works as a pump boy (Shell Corp.) to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 2 and 5 years old. Rhodabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rhodabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business operation and family needs. Rhodabelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is a member of the Mujeres Forjadoras community bank, a group that is comprised of 10 members who own small businesses. Irma has been making and selling bed sheets, bedspreads, and slipcovers for a living for 24 years. She launched this business because she did not want to depend on her partner since he did not let her work and treated her badly. Consequently, Irma got a divorce and had to support her three children, so she set up the sewing shop in which she currently works. Irma states that it was not easy. She had to knock on some doors and sell her merchandise, but thanks to her dedication and efforts, she has managed to obtain better profits, a better quality of life, and a good education for her children. Her eldest son even has his own business now. This loan is for purchasing livestock (cows and bulls) so that she can sell them; this is a new business that she is planning on getting into.

To meet her expenses and provide the best for her children, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. But farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite meager earnings. Her biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. To a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Esther joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow which produces milk daily, which Esther sells to her neighbours. Today, Esther is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow and is planning to become a fully-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage.

This inherited from parents organization, started as traditional organization taht only distributed rice-field water. Today SUBAK not only arrange for water distribution, but also to provide business opportunities within this organization. I Made Sudiartaya as SUBAK head plays a big role in these business opportunities. In processing farming needs support materials like: fertilizer: Ponska, Urea, TSP (local brands), and also seeds for plants like rice, corn and soybean. With a capital of Rp6,000,000 (about US$675), I Made Sudiartaya would try to provide those support materials. I Made Sudiartaya  would supply fertilizer and seed for 20 farmers working on an area of 15 hectares. The fertilizer would be bought from local distributor KUD in large quantity to obtain lower quantity discount price. I Made Sudiartaya thjen sold to the farmers depending on their needs. Problems facing I Made Sudiartaya are payment issues. The farmers would pay for fertilizer or seed by Harvest payment system (once every 5 months). Only after 5 months could I Made Sudiartaya obtain his profits. Payment were done by cash or farmers production like in dried shell rice, corn or soybean. In 5 months I Made Sudiartaya could get about 750kg in shell dried rice, or when cashed about Rp1,500,000 (about $167). I Made Sudiartaya would like to add more fertilizers and seeds to supply another 25 farmers working on an area of 30 hectares.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u2019\u2019SUBAK\u201d itulah nama organisasi pengaturan air sawah yang ada di Pulau  Bali.Organisasi  warisan dari orang tua di Bali ini berawal dari organisasi  tradisinal yang semula hanya mengatur pembagian air disawah . Saat ini Subak tidak hanya untuk mengatur pengairan saja tetapi juga banyak peluang usaha yang tersedia  dalam organisasi ini.\r\nI Made Sudiartaya sebagai Ketua Subak banyak berperan dalam peluang usaha ini.Dalam pegolahan lahan pertanian diperlukan sarana penunjang usaha seperti  Pupuk :Ponska, Urea ,TSP dan juga diperlukan bibit untuk tanaman seperti bibit padi, jagung dan kedelai.\r\nDengan modal usaha Rp 6.000.0000,- I Made Sudiartaya berusaha menyediakan sarana tersebut diatas.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and lease-back microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":303883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married and has 5 adult children.  To make a living, Faamanuia owns & operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community.  Faamanuia has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faamanuia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3200 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment & tools to expand the business.  Faamanuia is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST, which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle for the business.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Faamanuia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: <p>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem. <p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Justus, 48, is a married father of four who runs a produce-selling business in the Kitookye trading center of Kihihi. He mostly sells beans, peas and coffee. He started this business eight years ago with savings from his farming business. Justus comes across as a down-to-earth, strong-willed and cooperative gentleman. \r\n\r\nClients of his business vary from hotel owners, housewives, to retailers. Justus says he still runs his farming business given the fact that it is too a dependable means of livelihood in Uganda.

For many years she worked as a craftswoman, but her agility and skill for weaving chompas (typical garments of Peru) decreased as she grew older. For this reason she decided to dedicate herself to selling prepared foods.

He is a very experienced entrepreneur, having been self-employed for the past 4 years. Business has been good for Alisher. There is always demand for clothing and as the economy has improved in Tajikistan, more people have been able to afford new clothing. Alisher is not married yet. He dreams of building his own house and making a happy and friendly family. Alisher has requested a loan of $2000 USD to increase his available working capital. Eventually, Alisher hopes to have his own small store. This loan will help him purchase new inventory and continue to invest in his business.\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, new Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a phone booth and sells telephone services, rechargeable phone cards, various small items (candy, cookies, toothpaste, detergent, tins of milk, etc.) as well as shoes, in the Lenin public square in Cotonou. In order to do all she can to respond to the demand from her clientele and grow her business, she is presently requesting her third loan from ALID\u00e9. <P>\r\n\r\n \r\nThe significance of ALID\u00e9 in the local language of Benin, Fon, is \"there is always a pathway for the poorest of the poor\". Benin is a small country in West Africa next door to Nigeria, where the average per capita income stands at US$ 1,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":322840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Use Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase of phone use cards, 2 cases of cookies, 5 boxes of candy, and a case of toothpaste","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T16:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Choukouratou Olanik\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904352},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126385},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549814},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983605},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895974},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735554},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623065},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019771},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858266},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":10818.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618426}],"funded_date":"2009-05-21T17:46:08Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":114063,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Janet tiene 29 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y su hijo en una casa arrendada.

that means it will not lead you to your aim.\u201d This statement by a great philosopher from the past has evidence in modern life. Turargul O., a group leader, is a young woman who has felt its truth. From an early age, she knew what poverty was, and will never forget the endless days of struggle against it. \r\n<br>However, it is good to look back on those days from easier circumstances. After a successful marriage, Turargul gave birth to a little princess. Now, this cute creation of God is just two years old. Turargul's husband works as a driver for a hunting firm. About four years ago, Turargul's friends advised her to breed cattle. With her savings of about 15,000 KGS, she started a business. Now she continues with this business and has already bought domestic appliances with the profits. By the time her daughter is older, she wants to be able to give her an education. As her business is flourishing, she is requesting a loan to buy small cattle to resell after fattening.\r\n<br>Venera D. is 26 years old and married. She has two children, both of whom go to kindergarten. Venera has her own shop where she sells daily foodstuffs. Her husband helps her in her business by transporting goods. Venera began her business with 10,000 KGS and now her profit is 8,000 KGS per month. In the near future, she wants to expand the shop by building another structure. With this loan, she will increase her assortment of goods.\r\n<br>Almakul I. is 52 and single.  She breeds cattle, and is assisted by her brother. She is requesting a loan to increase the number of cattle.\r\n<br>Gulmira F. is 43 and divorced. She has two daughters \u2013 the elder is already married and the youngest attends school. Gulmira sells salads in the market and also works for a firm. With her loan, she wants to buy cattle in order to increase their number. In the future, she wants to buy a flat and give her youngest daughter an education. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries.

Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a networking  business.  Her husband Jose Y., who is 64 years old, is a retired employee who helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 15 to 27 years old. Estela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Estela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock so that she can continue to save up for the future. Estela Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He has worked hard in this business and thanks to his hard work his customer base and income are stable. With the earnings that he has obtained from this business, he decided to venture into selling women's shoes, as there are few such businesses in the area.

In order to do so he has needed to request a loan of 2000 soles from Edpyme Alternativa. This will contribute to the achievement of his goal. He has already had one loan financed by Kiva through Edpyme Alternativa and Capital Semilla.

Currently, he\u2019s been working for 30 years and with the experience he\u2019s gained over two decades of non-stop work he\u2019s managed to position himself among customers who recognize him as a supplier of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and avocadoes in the town market in Rionegro, Antiquia.\r\n\r\nAt present, Francisco needs to buy a supply for his business as well as baskets to display his products.  However, he lacks the economic resources to do so.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, La joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is La's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

The women share professional ties, kinship, friendship and live in the same neighborhood. They primarily trade in condiments, grains, fresh cow\u2019s milk, pagnes (lengths of brightly-colored African cloth), and firewood.  Some aspects of their business are of a daily variety, as in milk, while others are seasonal (grains, wood and condiments, et cetera). To meet the ever-increasing customer demand, they decided to join the loan program at the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, which has granted them three group loans, all repaid in full.<p>\r\n\r\nThe women in the group often replenish their stock of coarse grains and fresh cow\u2019s milk locally in Zogofina, but at times go to the neighboring villages of Zenguela and Soignebougou for firewood, and to the regional capital of S\u00e9gou for condiments, pagnes and rice. With this loan they expect to buy 50 liters of fresh cow\u2019s milk (20 liters per day), 150 kilograms of coarse grains and pulses (millet, peanuts, beans, et cetera), 4 cartloads of firewood, 10 lengths of quality pagne and 300 kilograms of spices and rice.<p>\r\n\r\nProducts are then generally sold retail for cash or credit on market day at the village square, or both during the day and in the evening from home.  Their customers generally consist of women and men coming from other villages to make their purchases in Zogofina.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His greatest desire is to see his family get ahead.  He tries to provide them with the best care and attention within his home.  He has been selling groceries for 9 years in the store he set up.  It is in a rented place in a very commercial area.  With out a doubt, working in this trade helped him improve his house and offer his children quality schooling.  He begins work early by cleaning the store.  He must wait on customers that shop early so Mr. Victor tries to have the doors open by 6 in the morning.  He tends to his business, together with his wife, until midnight.  He is careful since there are more sales at night but also greater danger due to delinquency.  Victor wants to open another store in his home, like a branch of the main store, in the near future.  He, as well as all his co-workers, have known how to manage themselves responsibly at their community bank in the five years he has been working with MFP.  This has made his group one of the most trustworthy and organized in the institution.

He\u2019s 49 years old. He\u2019s married and has 3 children, ages 24, 22 and 18. The middle child is currently going to school. He finished up to 6th grade of the old school system, but he couldn't continue because his parents had serious financial problems. He lives in his own house with his family and he also supports his father, who lives in the city of Maputo, sending him money and food.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo to go to Beira for a service mission in 1983. That same year he was transferred from Beira to Nampula, north of Mozambique to continue with his activity. Once his service was completed, he returned to the capital city, where he lives now. He\u2019s worked for TCM (Mozambique Transportation and Communications) as HR Manager since 1982, 8 hours a day. After his day time job, he devotes around 4 hours a day to his business. He gets a 7.800.00 salary from his company and 4.000.00mt a month from his business, which he uses for household expenses. He saves around 1.500.00mt from time to time to put on his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe received a loan from Millinium Bim bank, but after he finished his payments he decided to leave. He met Hluvuku through a soccer tournament where he was a referee and Hluvuku was participating, so he decided to visit our organization. This is his 2nd loan for an amount of 20.000.00mt, which he will use to buy products, such as oil, eggs, milk, drinks and others, to increase his stock. His previous loan was for 12.000.00mt which he used for this same activity. (1 dollar = 28.51MT)\r\n \r\nIn the future he would like to request for more loans to make home improvements and to restock him business. For this reason, he\u2019s committed to pay this loan in time and access to more money later.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jimena Lopez, Kiva

To make a living, Charito owns and operates a furniture-making business. She makes and sells general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Charito has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $220 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Charito joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Charito has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Charito is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product line. This will be her 8th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested in her buy and sell business, selling different goods, and embarked on a sewing business. The profit is what she uses for daily expenses.\r\n\r\nDuring her almost one year in ASHI, Rodalyn has shown herself to be hardworking and she has strong belief to make her dreams come true. Rodalyn still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family. \r\n\r\nNow on her second loan, Rodalyn requests 9,000 Philippine pesos to create a broader business. Specifically, the money will be used to purchase cotton and planel for her sewing business and an inventory of rice for her buy and sell business. She is very determined and disciplined to utilize the money which is lent to her.\r\n\r\nRodalyn is grateful to ASHI-Kiva partners for the support, even with all the dreams and challenges in her

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future he\u2019d like to improve the quality of his products thus obtaining better prices.\r\n\r\nThis is his 8th loan with MFP.  He feels that the loan will be very beneficial for his growth as a farmer.  He is a very active and supportive member of his communal bank.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy more manure and fertilizers to improve the productivity of his fields.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":635942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It is located in Cordoba's savannah region. He thought of his enterprising idea in the city of Barranquilla when the community had its first inhabitants. At first he sold fried foods and natural fruit drinks, including orange, lemon, mango, zapote (a fleshy tropical fruit), medlar, watermelon, melon, and guanabana (a fragrant tropical fruit). His business gradually expanded and he added common foods with the goal of catering to the clientele he had already won. Today he has a space in his house that has become too small to support the growth of his business and this is just the challenge he faces. He needs to recondition it and in the future to move it to a new location. His Kiva loan is the first he has with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and with it he will purchase ingredients, such as rice, meats, and vegetables in large volumes to earn discounts on cash sales. He will also purchase tools for the kitchen to be able to serve his clients more freely. Pablo is married and he has 4 children between the ages of 12 and 23.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and does not have any children.  To make a living, Siupolu owns and operates an agricultural business raising crops. The main source of income for her business comes from planting, harvesting, and selling fruits and vegetables.  Siupolu has been in this business for over four years, and she earns approximately 156 Samoan Tala WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Siupolu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation, and her ability to engage in business activities.  Siupolu's first loan request from SPBD is for 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Siupolu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 36 years old, married, and the father of 4 children who are 6, 7, 9, and 11 years old.  All go to school.  He only studied through the 3rd grade because his parents died and he didn't have anybody who could support his studies.  He lives in the service workers houses with his family and even supports his brothers and sisters by sending money for the power and water bills.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo for Boane in order to set up a new home with his family after he found a new job.  He has worked as a driver in the outlying ironworks sector for more than 10 years and works on average around 10 hours each day.  He receives a monthly salary of 6,799 MZN that he uses for household expenses.  He even saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans through banks.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(construction materials), and Sara Zen\u00f3n M. (lingerie sales by catalog).   \r\n\r\nReyna S. is a single mother with three children, who are already grown and married. She used to work as a cleaning lady, but when she began suffering from osteoporosis, she had to leave her job, since the condition affected her legs. She decided to dedicate herself to another kind of work, so 15 years ago, she began making hand-knitted garments such as blouses, jackets, scarves, sweaters, baby clothes, etc. At the beginning, it was hard for her, but with time and continuous practice, it became easier. At present, she buys magazines to make more modern clothing designs and satisfy her customers' needs. She will use the funds from the loan she is requesting to buy yarn, hook closures, buttons, zippers, etc. Whenever she goes out, Reyna takes a sample garment and also carries supplies to keep working during the journey. She offers her merchandise to her family members and neighbors. She makes the most sales for special days such as birthdays, and during the cold months. With her earnings, she wants to support her daughter with her therapy so that she will be able to walk again, since her daughter also has osteoporosis which is advancing very rapidly. In the future, Reyna plans to open her own store and put her blouses and jackets on display, so that people will get to know her work and she will increase her sales. \r\n\r\nReyna and the other members are grateful for the support provided to them by Kiva through the Realidad Foundation, which will help them achieve their goals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia

The difficulties she anticipates for this loan are the possibility of theft while the corn is still in the fields and also severe climactic conditions. \r\n\r\nHer strategy for business growth is to buy other fields to avoid paying rent for farming and to boost her crops. In the next few years, she would like to become a modern farmer and to have fields sufficient enough for farming and for creating employment for other people.

Being unable to get an education due to lack of support, he taught himself to drive and got his driving license in 1982. Unable to buy his own car, he frequented transportation centers to take over from drivers during their rest periods. However, this did not guarantee him enough income to support his household needs. Very quiet and serious, he worries constantly about his family\u2019s well-being. Despite his precarious situation, he succeeded in getting a $200 loan which he gave to his wife to set up a small food business so that she could contribute to the household expenses. With his help, his wife was able to manage and repay this loan, and she received a further loan, in her own name, which she is repaying with no problems.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. T. is now requesting a $2000 loan to buy a car so that he can provide a taxi service. The financing of this project will be of enormous help in stabilizing Mr. T.\u2019s income to provide for the needs of his family, and especially to ensure his children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1962 \u00e0 Tchagba dans le Haho, Monsieur T.
