She owns a business venture selling fruits and vegetables.  Taulafo Elenoa has 2 years of experience in this business.  Taulafo Elenoa needs a loan of WST $1000 0.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \n\nIn 2008, Taulafo Elenoa joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Taulafo Elenoa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks. Elenoa is a client who willing to help her family as she now rejoins the program.\n\nThe following social metrics for Taulafo Elenoa S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  Fulisia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Fulisia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Fulisia joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fulisia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has had her business for six years, starting when she received her first loan in Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business, where she has a little grocery stand and takes it to the local public school to sell snacks, candies and other groceries. She also sell shoes and clothing. She will use the profits to invest and save. She wants to run her business from home or her own location, because she doesn't want in the future to be moving.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she was needing motivation to start a business, which she received in her group and with Esperanza. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding Hato Mayor, an area where the economy is dominated by agriculture. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":590406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She lives on the island of Buhangin, Binangonan, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWith her belief and faith to get out of poverty, in 2008 she decided to join ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. During her previous loans, she carefully invested in her sari-sari store business (a small retail store selling different goods) which gives her a reasonable income. Now on her third loan, she proposes to borrow the amount of Php 15,000 pesos as additional capital, again for her sari-sari store. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase six sacks of rice worth Php 8,400.00, 50 kilos of sugar at Php 2,100.00, 50 bottles of cooking oil at Php 1,000.00, 50 packs of cigarettes at Php 1,300.00, and 50 liters of gasoline at Php 2,000.00 with the remaining Php 200.00 for travel fares. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that her business will expand so that they will have savings for future use and dreams of having a successful general store, and also of helping her family to have a good life and to break the cycle of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":444001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is single and lives in Chinchero, where he makes knitwear like blankets, belts and chullos (Peruvian hat) and sells these to the tourists that visit the city. He is investing 1000 dollars in materials such as sheep and alpaca wool and natural dyes like conchineal, cucamarca, etc. He has done this for 8 years and it is going well. Being a member of the Foundation has really helped him to better himself and make his business grow. With this new loan he will stock his business and is going to buy more materials.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n<br>Yolanda operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Yolanda earns a living by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at piece rates. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 11, 000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n<br>Yolanda dreams of renovating her house soon, with the profits from all of her work.

(PK-00251) is a 42-year-old male living in the town of Pejarakan - Singaraja, Indonesia.  He is married and has one infant child.  To make a living, Budi owns & operates a business making & selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  Budi has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 500,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Budi joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Budi is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK. Budi is now requesting a new loan of 2,500,000 IDR, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by the borrower from MUK.  Budi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nBudi S. (PK-00251) merupakan 42 tahun pria.  Dia (laki-laki) tinggal di kota Pejarakan - Singaraja - Bali.  Dia (laki-laki) menikah dan memiliki 1 anak usia balita.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Budi memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pangan.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah membuat & menjual makanan.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual makanan ringan & makanan kecil lainnya di tengah masyarakat setempat.  Budi sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 6 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Budi menghasilkan sekitar 500.000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Budi bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Budi telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (laki-laki) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2.500.000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli inventaris & modal kerja tambahan.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Budi berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk mendukung keuangan anggota keluarga langsung peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking..  \"\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":648438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory & working capital\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Pejarakan - Singaraja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-11-23T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Budi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208500},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":206500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188717132},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191455974},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195878570},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319866},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189231},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211262854},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216542792},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221711301},{"amount":25.02,"local_amount":208500,"processed_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":223078.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227081727},{"amount":74.82,"local_amount":623500,"processed_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":667095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244609598}],"funded_date":"2010-11-23T14:43:14Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:31:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":255071,"name":"Blanca Flor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Blanca is thirty-four years old.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and buying & selling dried fish. Her husband Deonilo, who is 42 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 8 to 20 years old.  Joesela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joesela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 23rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to purchase additional piglets so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Joesela is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She makes her home here in a simple setting, with two of her three children and her long term partner, also their father. She said to us that her most difficult challenge is that she has a very rebellious child, and she need to deal with this. Everyday she pray to the Lord for him.

The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees for her children.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

the group is also attending activities on the weekends, such as food fairs and raffles, with the goal of capitalizing its savings so that the savings can support members at times when they cannot make good on their payments for some reason.  \r\n\r\nThe representative of the group and the president thank and acknowledge all the supporters of Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya for the support and training that they provide.  \r\n\r\n

She has been doing this for fifteen years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting the merchandise, as she only has one means of transportation and she needs another in order to speed up her work.

He works from early morning till late at night hoping to have a rich harvest. Murodali sells his crops at the market where they are always in high demand due to their good quality. His work fills him with great optimism and allows him to help his beloved children. His goal is to improve the quality of his agricultural produce even more and expand his cattle breeding business. Today Murodali is requesting a loan of 4500 Somoni to buy greater quantities of seeds and fertilizer. Let's help Murodali as he works hard to improve the quality of life for his family.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Each partner has a different history, such as is the case of Hortensia who worked as an employee in a store and, at the same time, traveled to markets bringing clothes to sell. At first, she brought little merchandise, but presently, she has more merchandise and stock and she sells second-hand clothes. Julia also sells second-hand clothes. At first, she had very little merchandise. Now, her business has grown and she has more customers. She also breeds guinea pigs. Julia has noted that one year ago she had six guinea pigs but now she has 58, which she sells to restaurants.<p>\r\n\r\nThe partners need loans in different amounts. Some amounts are of 200 soles, 400 soles, 600 soles and 800 soles totaling a loan amount of 12,200 soles to the Banco Comunal. These loans will be invested in the purchase of baby clothes, pants, sweaters, cosmetics, tools, carbon stone, spare parts, transistors, integrated circuits, filters, fabric for ponchos for the Carnival celebrations, apples, bananas, papaya, shoes and products for the start of a small caf\u00e9 and rental of premises.\r\n<p>\r\nThey will use their savings to buy necessities for the home and education for their children.

Thi Thuy has been a member of TYM fund since 2000. Before joining the fund, her family's economic situation was difficult with their main source of income from buying & selling scraps. Due to lack of capital, they were only able to bring in about 1.5 USD per day from this work. Since joining the fund, they were able to borrow additional money to invest in the business, and thus their income has been steadily rising. She was able to purchase a rice grinding machine to mill rice for the local community. Their income now averages 180 USD per month. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 425 USD to buy additional rice grinding machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva

Four of the children are independent, releasing her from the burden of their basic needs, but her last born, who lives with her, is in the final year at the junior high school. \r\n\r\nAkosua lives in Agya Baaniikrom, which is a suburb in the western region of Ghana. She treks to the surrounding villages to buy plantains and then transports them to the Volta region, her hometown, to sell them. She says is it a very lucrative business.

Nurali is a diligent and tenacious farmer, who strives to meet his family\u2019s needs. His wife does not work and thus he carries the burden alone through his farming income to meet his family\u2019s needs. Nurali works on a farm owned by his parents. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming supplies, seeds and fertilizer require a larger capital which he didn\u2019t have. Nurali is now relieved that IMON International is helping him get a loan he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. Nurali is waiting for his next harvest which he hopes to yield better results from his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children\u2019s educational needs and if there is still some money left he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"The communal bank, \u201cDivinas\u201d is represented by Silvia and is composed of 13 members. The group will be in its second loan cycle. The members are very responsible, cheerful, punctual, and above all, united. \r\n\r\nSilvia is married, and just like her, her husband is a hard worker. She is a hairdresser and works out of her home, which is under an anticredito agreement (anticretico is a transaction whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from the tenant in exchange for housing, which must be paid back at the end of the contract. If the loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to the tenant). She and her husband want to save for their own house where they can raise a family since they do not yet have children. Silvia needs capital to purchase tools for her business such as hairdryers, flat irons, and to arrange an ambience to give better service to her customers, who are the source of her daily income. \r\n\r\nAll the members of the group are multifaceted, meaning they work in all kinds of fields. They like to work hard, and they know how to do business. The members sell food, groceries, chickens, soft drinks and empanadas, clothing, vegetables, jewelry, and offer public transport. \r\n\r\nThe members do not compete with one another because everyone has a different business. They all do well because they go to different places to sell their merchandise or offer their services. For example, Susana sells empanadas and \u201cmasitas,\u201d a type of pastry, and has clients that place orders by the day.  Her business provides her with a decent salary.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to grow the members\u2019 businesses and attract more clients to increase income and improve quality of life for the families. The members already have plenty of experience with group loans.

Abdusamat is a very responsible and optimistic person, and he has three children and a wife to support. He wants to develop his business of raising cattle in his village because there is a very high demand for milk from villagers and especially from customers who come from surrounding towns. Abdusamat is helped by his wife. \r\n\r\nHe is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing; accordingly, their expenses are growing, too. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities along with the services provided by IMON International will help him improve the business. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She learned this business from a friend. <P>\r\n\r\nIn her search for complementary financial resources, Mrs. Kadiatou Diakit\u00e9 decided to join the credit program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom she is having her first experience as a borrower.<P>\r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy three bales of used clothing of different sorts (for children, sheets and napkins). She runs her business out of her home in Heremakono Nord and at the market in Bougouni on Thursday market days. She has a clientele essentially composed of women and of hotels and works at this business all year round. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nShe generally buys her merchandise in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) from companies that import used clothing and in the Republic of Burkina Faso. \r\n<P>\r\nMrs. Kadiatou Diakit\u00e9  hopes to make a monthly profit of 50,000 FCFA which will be used to pay the interest on the loan and to help her husband cover family expenses (health, education, food, etc.). She will reinvest any remainder in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Nora has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 1,500.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Nora joined PMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Nora is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Nora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

These two jobs allow him to take care of his family\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nZiad requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase feed for his cows and tools for his work as an electrician. This is the first time that Ziad has requested a loan.\r\n\r\nZiad is special in his work because he is known for his good dairy products. His clients are his friends and neighbors, as well as people from outside his region. When he first started his business, he didn\u2019t have a lot of cash.

She stocks up from suppliers in the town of Sikasso and sells all her produce in the market at Bougouni, on a wholesale and retail basis, for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of men and women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she hopes to make a monthly profit of 40,000FCFA, while the other members of the group are counting on making a monthly profit of 25,000FCFA, part of which will be used for their businesses and part for their children's school fees.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":618292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T13:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613633},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752068},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606315},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:56Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917976},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360902},{"amount":75,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":35215.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226208}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T15:03:37Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":242825,"name":"Loreta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loreta  S., a married woman who lives in Sitio Sta. Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu, earns her living by operating a fishing business.  Her husband, Jaime S., 51 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have eight children who are between 9 and 29 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nLoreta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Loreta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for future expansion of her business. Loreta  S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

He is 30 years old. Menardo is married and has 3 very young children. To make a living, Menardo owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling green bananas & vegetables like squash and eggplants in the local community. Menardo has been engaged in his business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Menardo joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Menardo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Menardo is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Menardo from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives in his parents' home, and supports them financially and works daily to give them the comfort they deserve.\r\n\r\nWarren's job consists of cargo and passenger transportation within and outside the city.  He goes out very early in search of his eventual passengers, whom he picks up in the busiest streets of the city and transports to the locations they request.

Now he learns something new every day and he works a lot so he can continue generating income for his home.  It is going very well for him because during the 10 hours he is in the street he knows where to go and when.  Besides, sometimes he gets hourly contracts and this is even better for him.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to continue doing his work as normally as he has done it, and to begin to save to buy a new motorcycle taxi.

is a brave lady who works each and every day to support her four children.  They drive her life and energize her to continue moving forward, despite having suffered the abandonment of her husband a year ago.  This episode was a very painful chapter in her life, but it did not destroy her.  She always worked in food sales, and her strength has become an example to many people.  She has decided to continue in her endeavors to support her children, particularly the needs of her seven year old who has been greatly impacted by the abandonment of her father.  For Estela, the days of highest sales volume are Sundays which have the greatest flow of customers.  She sells her foods by traveling around the local areas and her sales are steady given how well-received her dishes are by her clientele.

He wants to provide his family with a good future. Elmer works long, hard days as a brickmaker: he wakes up at 6am each day to mix and mold the bricks, which he later puts in the oven to fire so that they will be all ready to sell. He usually receives very large orders, so he often asks for help from his neighbors (who are also brickmakers) in order to fill the orders. He always promises to help them when they need the help. His favorite part of the job is making the bricks, since he feels like he's just playing with clay, it doesn't feel like work to him. He has had his business for the past five years, and says that the hardest part is fitting all the bricks in the oven, since he has to arrange them so that they all cook through evenly. For the future, he hopes to expand his business and improve his income. \r\n\r\nThis is Elmer's third loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and he doesn't want to miss any payments due to lack of money, so he is already making contacts to sell more bricks. He is the only man in his village bank, so he always tries to be responsible and respectful of his female group members. With the requested loan of 2,000 soles, he will buy new brick molds and thus increase the number of bricks he can produce in a single day. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":364568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Buy molds to make bricks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:08Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641693},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081135},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":334.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997285},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:40Z","rounded_local_amount":334.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842629},{"amount":225.45,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":671.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734204}],"funded_date":"2009-08-06T20:14:41Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":131377,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana es socia del Banco Comunal Sarita.\nAna es conviviente, tiene 25 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Ana tiene un puesto en el mercado Nery Garc\u00eda en donde vende verduras al por mayor y menor, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas desde la madrugada.\nAna necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de cebolla y culantro.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Ana son construir su casa y mejorar su negocio.\n","en":"Ana is a member of the Sarita Community Bank.
