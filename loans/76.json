beternak babi. Dengan lahan yang terbatas Ibu Made Mertini membuat kandang sederhana yang bisa menampung 2-3 ekor babi. Walaupun kandangnya terletak berdekatan  dengan rumah tetangganya namun limbah dari kandangnya tidak sampai mengganggu lingkungan sekitarnya karena ternak dan juga kandangnya dirawat dengan baik. Hasil dari memelihara babi penggemukan tersebut dipergunakannya untuk mencukupi kebutuhan rumah tangganya baik itu untuk di dapur maupun keperluan lainnya seperti biaya pendidikan anaknya yang berusia 14 tahun dan saat ini masih duduk di bangku SMP. Walaupun hasil yang diperolahnya dari usaha ini tidak terlalu banyak tapi hal ini tidak mengurangi semangatnya karena usaha ini sudah ditekuni cukup lama dan terbukti bisa membantu menopang kehidupan keluarganya. Ibu Ni Made Mertini saat ini mengikuti program ternak babi yang dikelola DINARI dengan jangka waktu pinjaman selama enam bulan dan pembayaran akan dilakukan kembali setelah periode pinjaman berakhir, dan selalu berharap usahanya bisa lebih maju dan keuntungan yang sebelumnya hanya Rp 300.000 per ekor bisa bertambah sehingga kehidupan keluarganya bisa lebih sejahtera lagi.","en":"Living in the suburb with dense population does not hold Made Mertini to run pig raising business. Having limited space, she build a simple pigpen for 2-3 pigs. The pigpen is closed to her neighbour house, however the waste is not a problem as she cleans the cattle and the pigpen regularly. The income from raising fattening pig is used for meeting her daily needs and for education of her 14-year old child in junior high. Although the profit is not that much, but it is proved to be able to support her family livelihoods and, therefore, inspire her to keep the spirit for the business. Made Martini joins pig raising program of DINARI with 6-months loan term and repayment is started after the loan period is over. She hopes for the development of her business and for her profit from USD 33 per pig to be increased for the prosperity of her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Iman Persada Madaze, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":202376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy piglet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-09-13T19:40:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Mertini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-27T21:17:29Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-23T08:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1742030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308580},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1742030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849803},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-17T08:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1742030.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080630}],"funded_date":"2008-09-13T21:17:29Z","paid_date":"2009-04-17T08:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iman Persada","image":71532}},{"id":68991,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Por el bienestar D. sus 7 hijos, Rolando trabaja arduamente en sus terrenos D. cultivo, lo  hayamos rumbo a su chacra en compa\u00f1\u00eda D. su burrito, quien le ayuda a llevar las cargas  y las herramientas necesarias para trabajar en sus tierras.

The  house has access to electricity and piped water, and the family gets two meals a day. She also owns rooms for tenants. \r\n<p>\r\nTeopista earns a living from the poultry farm at her home where she has about 400 chickens. She supplies their eggs to shop owners and sells to about five customers a day. She works seven days a week and has been in this business for 30 years. Teopista incurs extra transport costs to and from shops, and the Mengo-Kisenyi Market in Kampala. She currently faces the challenge of thieves who break in to steal her chickens, and she is trying to build strong defences to curb that challenge. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Teopista's 22nd loan since she joined Kiva partner, MCDT SACCO, eight years ago, and she has always worked with this same loan group. Teopista wants to use this loan to buy more chickens and feed.

This group is going into their first cycle having demonstrated their unity and solidarity in previous meetings.  The majority of the members dedicate themselves to the sale of vegetables, clothing, provisions and other things that they sell in the interior of the country (Nor Yungas - Zud Yungas) as it is not a well exploited market and offers great opportunities to sell products.  Other members dedicate themselves to hairdressing, as they have beauty salons located in strategic places where they have a lot of regular clients.  Between them, there are members that make sweaters and handmaD. blankets which they sell to export businesses or locally.  Others offer their products in markets or in the street, and their products are economically maD., using low cost working materials.  Other members dedicate themselves to public transport, and they need the credit to buy tyres and spare parts.  The current market is saturated with similar products, but the members know how to move forward, taking their products to the interior and exterior of the country.  The members are in their first cycle but they can already count on experience in such groups which is why they promise to give everything to move forward with responsability and unity.  Due to the journeys they must take, some of the members couldn't be at the meeting, but sent their partners instead.\r\n<p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":372976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Operations' capital\/capital de Operaciones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia Felismar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica Jovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Dulce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flavia  Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Sara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Paola Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirka Gely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1803.68},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1824.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1845.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1866.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1888.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1909.87},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1931.85},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1954.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1976.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1999.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":261.06},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":264.06},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.1},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":273.28},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":276.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.61},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":282.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":286.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":792.22,"local_amount":5473.54,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5521.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87034486},{"amount":270.18,"local_amount":1866.66,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:34:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1883.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87034487},{"amount":273.28,"local_amount":1888.14,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:00:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1904.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946695},{"amount":276.43,"local_amount":1909.87,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1926.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946696},{"amount":279.61,"local_amount":1931.85,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:27:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1948.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788362},{"amount":282.83,"local_amount":1954.08,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1971.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788363},{"amount":286.08,"local_amount":1976.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1993.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678485},{"amount":289.37,"local_amount":1999.3,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2016.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678486}],"funded_date":"2009-09-28T20:07:30Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Harvey","image":null}},{"id":134566,"name":"Lauina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lauina M.

Gulnora is 37 years old. She is divorced and has two children. Gulnora has been selling clothing for kids for the past five years. With her savings she started to travel to the neighboring towns to buy clothing and then sell it at the local market of Dushanbe. Little by little she increased her number of clients and expanded her business. Nevertheless, her current selection of garments is poor; therefore, she requests a loan of 5,000 MNT. With this loan Gulnora can purchase new and varied merchandise to offer her clients.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a general store, motorcycle transport and videoke singing. Her husband Pasto B. Jr., who is 40 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have five children who are 13 to 21 years old. Meliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Meliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks of goods for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future expansion of her business and the education of her children. Meliza B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He starts his work at 7 in the morning and finishes at 8 at night, every day of the week. He carries out his work with a lot of joy. He feels very satisfied because in a very little time he has accomplished the short-term objectives he had drawn up for himself. Before starting the business, Victor was studying to be a mechanic in a private vocational school, but his lack of economic resources forced him to abandon his studies. Now, with great expectations in his work and his professional life, he wishes to continue prospering. To achieve this he is willing to invest all of his effort. He is thinking about acquiring another cell phone. With this purpose in mind, he turns to your good disposition and requests a loan to make the goals he has set for himself a reality.

His parents taught him how to get by as an agriculturist, and he learned very well.  Now that he is father of a family he still works as an agriculturalist.  Thanks to his parents he now has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer, and he hopes to increase his agricultural products so that he can bring his loved ones a more promising life.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, new Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

H\u1ec7  is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.

To making a living, H\u1ec7  owns and operates a business venture in the food sector running a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products such as fish and shrimp in the local community.  H\u1ec7  has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, H\u1ec7  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

She is now requesting a new loan of 5.152.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

From an early age her parents taught her how to work on the farm. She is a farmer and owns 3 hectares of land planted with coffee, barbasco and coca leaves, all of them native to the Apurimac river valley. \r\n\r\nShe has worked in her lands for 4 years. During the harvest she hires day labourers who harvest and transport the produce. What she likes the most about her job is reaping the fruits from her plants, as it gives her the feeling that their quality pays off the months of hard work. She thinks that the most difficult part is to transport the produce from the farm to the collection centres in the city of San Francisco, where she's offered the best prices for her goods. \r\n\r\nHer main challenge is not to have enough income to cover the advance payments to the labourers who help her with the harvest. That's why she's requesting the support of the loans granted by MFP. However, her main priority at the moment is to sow more coffee plants, as she has 1 hectare of uncultivated land. This is her eight loan with MFP and she knows that if she pays it back on time she will be able to get another one with more confidence and without giving trouble to her community bank. With the requested loan she will be able to hire labourers to help her with the coffee harvest.

She was divorced 3 years ago, and has 6 children, although only the youngest two - Dennis and Greta - now live with her. Julia lives in her own house, located in the Alto Yapaz area. The desire to offer her children a decent quality of life, through doing work she loves, motivates Julia. Together with her family she will cultivate bananas, pineapples and coffee, on her own and rented land. The family have already found their agriculture profitable. Julia says it has enabled her to meet her domestic costs, pay for her children's education, and above all to save for whatever might present itself in future. She has dedicated herself to agriculture for 15 years and although sometimes she has been horrified to find her crops attacked by insects, she perseveres and will not let herself be beaten. She wakes at 5am each day to prepare food and go out to her fields until night falls. At weekends, she also finds time for selling anticuchos - dishes based on grilled beef heart - in the local square. She earns at least 35 to 40 Soles profit in this way. Because she has good earnings from her work, in future she would like to increase productivity. For this reason she plans to plant more coffee, a sought-after crop that fetches a good price in the markets. She belongs to a communcal bank calles \"Los progresistas\", and this is her third loan with [field partner] MFP. She is very pleased to be able to continue working with the other members of the association.

Th\u1eafm is the group leader of a two-member group receiving a loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u00f4ng Mai - Nh\u00f3m 02 (2).\r\n\r\nTh\u1eafm is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Th\u1eafm owns a manufacturing business, manufacturing and selling wood products to local businesses and community members. Th\u1eafm has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 2,500,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Th\u1eafm joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Th\u1eafm has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. She is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings to include beds and wardrobes. This will be Th\u1eafm's second loan from SEDA.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTh\u1eafm l\u00e0 46 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

He started engaging in growing coffee by his own accord and thanks to his own means and his desire to progress. He works daily form 6 am to 2 pm, helped by one of his brothers as his children cannot help him yet because they are too young; his wife takes care of the housework. To today, the main difficulties he has had to face are health- and money-related, as when he or someone from his family falls ill he has not enough money to travel to the closest health care facility. On the other hand, one of Santos\u2019 advantages is that his property is located in a very suitable area for the crops, therefore coffee production goes very well. For this reason he has dared asking for a loan, as he needs to buy manure and clear his land in order to give a better and appropriate maintenance to his crops. His goal is to gradually improve the technology of his plantation in order to generate more income to provide for his family. This is his first cycle with FAMA, and he plans on investing the money very well to punctually repay his dues, and to then be able to obtain more loans for higher amounts."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":837568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Catacamas, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-11T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Macario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165427}],"funded_date":"2011-08-13T21:25:16Z","paid_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":327994,"name":"Anne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anne is 35 years old, widowed and has one child, aged 13, to whom she hopes to provide education to the university level.

business venture, planting & harvesting taro (a tuber) for sale. She has many years of experience in this business. Matalena needs a loan of WST 1,000 to purchase weed killers such as Gramoxone.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Matalena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Matalena's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She finished primary school in Maputo and didn\u2019t attend secondary school because she got married.<p>Celina comes from a wealthier family than her husband; her father is a good carpenter in Maputo and always gave comfort to his family. Celina faced a lot of prejudice from her family when she decided to get married to a man who had no financial conditions at all, but she knew he was the right one. They have been married for 13 years now and today Celina\u2019s family loves him. They have 3 children: a 10-year-old girl, a 7-year-old boy and a 4-year-old boy. The 2 oldest attend primary school and the youngest go to kindergarten.<p>Celina and her husband moved to Ponta D\u2019Ouro, a village bordering South Africa very famous for tourism, for 2 years, but moved back to Maputo when she found a better job. In 2001 her husband found a job in a hotel in Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, so she moved there as well and started to work at the same hotel in the laundry department. In 2005 her husband was fired and moved back to Ponta D\u2019Ouro to work at a hotel there, but Celina decided to stay in Namaacha as her work was doing very well. She earns a minimum wage salary per month, in 2001 it was Mozambique Metical (MZN)850 and today it is MZN1,600. She works either between 6:00 am to 2:00 pm, or between 2:00 pm to 10:00 pm, and she has a cousin who stays home with the kids. The cousin is 19 years old and attends secondary school in the morning as well. On top of that income, Celina\u2019s husband sends her MZN3,000 monthly, helping with the household expenses and with their project of building a house.<p>This will be Celina\u2019s first loan. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is a client and decided to ask for a loan to buy more construction material and speed up the construction. With this loan, Celina will be able to finish the 2 rooms (including roofing), will move there and stop paying the current MZN500 per month in rent. It will still be necessary to finish the living room and kitchen, but Celina is extremely positive that she will be able to do it in 2 more loans.<p>In the future, Celina would like to build a small grocery shop or a bakery near her house to have a business to leave for her children. She dreams of giving her children the same luxury she had when she was a kid, and with her strength she will definitely succeed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":149603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Buy

Married and mothers of at least 4 children each, they all live in traditional polygamist families with the in-laws, and generally co-spouses, their children, their husbands, and brothers and sisters. Having known each other for about a decade tied by professional, familial, and marital relationships, these women sell farm produce, seasonings, firewood, and various other items. In their desire to grow their business, the members decided to participate in Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program, which they have been doing for two years. They have already received three group loans, all of which have been properly repaid. With this new loan, they plan to buy 14 bags of peanuts, 16 loads of firewood, and a large quantity of seasonings. They stock up on seasonings at the big market in the city of S\u00e9gou (especially on market days) from people from Bamako et Sikasso, on peanuts from farmers from Konodimini, on firewood in villages with those who have wood-chopping permits (i.e.,  in Chola and in Bounoubougoula). The Sinignesigui group sells the items at their homes, traveling in the neighborhoods of the city of S\u00e9gou, and in neighboring village markets for cash or credit to a clientele that consists primarily of retailers and women. They hope to earn 26,000 CFA francs per month on average, which will be used to make loan payments, the rest of which will be invested in their business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSinignesigui est un regroupement de quatre femmes du village de Zogofina de la pr\u00e9fecture de S\u00e9gou (quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique de la r\u00e9publique du Mali) qui ont une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 39 ans.

James also cares for 4 siblings.\r\n\r\nJames is a 10th grade drop-out due to lack of support. He lives in the West Point community in southern downtown Monrovia, Liberia. West Point is a community that is very crowded and is also filled with people who can\u2019t afford a daily meal.\r\n\r\nJames\u2019s business is selling dry goods like rice, farina, dishes, sugar, and the like. He started this business over 5 years ago with his retirement funds. In Liberia, retirement funds are like a peanut, because they can\u2019t take care of a whole family for 2 months, so James decided to use it to open a small-to-medium business. Today, his business feeds his family.\r\n\r\nBecause James lives in a community that is home to many fishermen, he sells things that fishermen need. He has been doing well, since most of his customers are those same fishermen. James needs this loan to purchase more dry goods so that he can continue to serve his customers. \r\n\r\nJames hopes to become a successful businessman in the field of importation. His dreams include building his own house in a better environment and sending his children to a better

Her reason for starting the business was to increase her large family\u2019s income and the business has been gradually growing ever since. In order to grow her business she requests for a loan of 5000 Somoni. Rahima is planning to spend the loan  purchasing more goods to sell thus increasing her variety of merchandise.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Everyday they work together to get ahead. From a young age this hardworking woman has worked hard in search of a better future, and she's always helped her husband with the constant home expenses. One year ago she began studying cosmetology; six months ago she began working as a barber\/stylist and makeup artist. Even though she currently only services friends and acquaintances, she hopes to open her own beauty salon one day. She says that she likes her work a lot because it allows her to offer her services in the comfort of her own home. Her customers visit her because she has nearly all of the necessary tools to offer them a good service at a reasonable price. She also does laundry for her neighbors, who pay her regularly for her services. This is her first loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually because she doesn't want to upset the people who have made the loan possible that will permit her to continue her business. She would also like to say that she likes the work of her group members because they're all very hard working and enterprising, just like her. Consuelo plans to invest the loan in the purchase of a hair dryer and other cosmetic implements that she needs to continue offering her comfortable beauty service to her clients; she hopes to keep progressing in that direction.

She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. <p>\r\n\r\nJonalyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to residents of the local neighborhood. It is, for example, the place to go to buy shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling individual items at retail prices. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 250 PHP in sales every day. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help her to continue to operate the business, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP. She would like to utilize the loan proceeds to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as a result of the loan because it will enable her to expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nJonalyn hopes her business will be stable and dreams of being able to provide her children with a high-quality education through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members each week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This causes the family of Ignacio with his four children to have an inadequate environment for family, education and other activities in their home, besides being a health, security and environmental hazard. Ignacio works in the field, mainly with corn, coffee, sugar cane and beans and consumes more than 12 pieces of ocote each week for lighting. His community and other households get these by cutting down trees in nearby forests, and depend exclusively on daylight for income-generating activities.

Aside from this business, he breeds pigs and cows. In Mr. Toem Sareth's fishing business, he does not have enough money to buy fishing equipment so his wife, Mrs. Hur T., decided to ask for a loan for her husband to buy the equipment. Mrs. Hur T. is a 54-year-old mother without any children. \r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Six members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

Bayong, Barangay Balintawak, Escalante City. She is 58 years old and married to Glecerio M. who presently works as a dental technician. Glecerio used to be the sole breadwinner for the family, but in spite of all his hard work, his income was just not enough to cover the expenses, especially the education-related expenses of their five children. Because both Cecilia and Glecerio aspired to a better life for their children, it was their dream to send them all to finish college. \r\n\r\nBecause of her sewing and dressmaking skills, Cecilia started accepting sewing jobs from a few regular customers until, by word of mouth and recommendations, her roster of clients grew. To have more working capital for her growing business, Cecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 and, because of the additional capital infusion, she took the opportunity to open a rice retailing business. Now her combined business income earns her an average monthly profit of PHP 7,000, which has made a big impact on their quality of life.\r\n\r\nToday, Cecilia\u2019s children, who are between 16 and 31 years of age, are well on their way to achieving Cecilia\u2019s and Glecerio's aspirations for them. As her businesses continues to grow, Cecilia uses her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to sustain the capital required to operate them. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 was used to maintain the inventory level of her rice retailing business as well as to purchase sewing supplies. Now on her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to continue sustaining her businesses. She intends to use the income for the education of her children and to save for their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Laila works from 8 AM to 8 PM every day except Saturday. <P>\r\n\r\nLaila is requesting her first loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company so that she may purchase additional, attractive clothing to sell.  With these new offerings, Laila hopes to attract more customers and to earn more profit.  Laila plans to reinvest a portion of profits earned into her business.  In addition, Laila will continue to pay school fees for her sister's children and gradually improve the life of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":429336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

They work together with the microfinance company, Soro Yiriwaso, in order to satisfy the demand of their customers. They are on their fifth group loan and all the previous loans have been repaid without any problem. They sell firewood, fruit and vegetables and creams and also make non-alcoholic drinks such as ginger juice. With their new loan they are planning to buy a truck load of firewood, four baskets of oranges, three stems of bananas, two bags of pineapple, five parcels of creams, one 50kg bag of sugar and three 100kg bags of root ginger (for the preparation of the ginger juice). They get their supplies at the market in Sikasso and in the neighbouring villages.

This group of people live in the canton of Paxtoca in Parajes Xecoxom 1 and 2, Paraje Chibatz 1. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":573286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Totonicap\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":113,"posted_date":"2010-07-25T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alida Floridalma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luc\u00eda Felisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilario Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1555.56},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.45},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.44},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":194.45,"local_amount":1555.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1555.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166802459},{"amount":194.44,"local_amount":1555.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1555.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172072480},{"amount":194.45,"local_amount":1555.56,"processed_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1555.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177363984},{"amount":194.44,"local_amount":1555.56,"processed_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-30T09:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1555.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182499099},{"amount":194.45,"local_amount":1555.56,"processed_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-10T09:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1555.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188634704},{"amount":208.32,"local_amount":1666.58,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-25T09:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1666.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191377757},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":1833.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1833.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195795704},{"amount":201.39,"local_amount":1611.1,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1611.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201237729},{"amount":138.9,"local_amount":1111.2,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1111.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211174748}],"funded_date":"2010-07-26T01:26:55Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catherine Dent","image":null}},{"id":221473,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen N. is 19 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.  Hellen has a business of wine making, which she has had for six years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen has requested a loan of 200,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy a machine that makes wine.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Hellen hopes to generate greater profits and help her educate her young sister.  In the future, Hellen hopes to own a house and a vehicle.      \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":581697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He\u2019s had a grocery store for over 10 years. \r\n\r\nHe says that he chose this business because he wanted to find a way to support his wife and children as well as have better economic solvency and an excellent quality of life.  Besides, he says that it\u2019s a very good source of income and that\u2019s why he decided to start with this business.  He will use the loan he got to continue investing in his store, to buy merchandise like: soft drinks, water, oil, eggs, salt, sugar, milk, beans, soap, toilet paper and other articles, to continue with his sales.\r\n\r\nMelchor says that his goal is to cause his store to grow as a business since he wants to build a larger locale because what he most wants to do is turn his small store into a large grocery store to have it better stocked and thus obtain more and better profits.  \r\n\r\nHe says that he knows his fellow group members well and comments that they are very responsible, hard working, trustworthy people who very much want to get ahead and better themselves.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMa.Fe operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She also earns income by selling personal products through direct selling. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a 12,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy grocery items and other products for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nMa.Fe dreams to expand her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. She also draws strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

It's a question of selling-price, and as she doesn't have a cooling tank in her area, she cannot sell 100% of her production to the Pil Company.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she is requesting is to buy a tank for cooling milk (the cooling tank is a place to keep raw milk in good state, and is how the Pil Company receives the milk every morning and evening). This tank costs approximately $16,000, so for this reason she is making the purchase together with 15 other people in her community, who are putting in $1,000 each.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Lucia will now be able to have access to this cooling tank, and will be able to deliver 100% of her milk production to the Pil Andina Company."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":879544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Although she is single and has no children, she is responsible for her mother and two cousins. With her pale skin and enviable beauty, she does not want to leave herself open to abuse by men. Her small savings and a $300 standby credit allowed her to buy a portable computer to do travelling secretarial work. This service would do more to increase her success and help her if she could receive more consistent financial support. This is why Ms. A. is currently asking for a $2000 credit to open a business center. The credit will be used to buy a microcomputer and a photocopier, and to install a telephone. Financing Ms. A. would act as encouragement and a good example for girls who succumb to debauchery, prostitution, and easy money, with all the problems that brings today like AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Thanks to her efforts, and especially her desire for self-improvement with her two activities, she has managed to obtain great results but she believes that with more investment capital, she could improve her income considerably.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Genoveva,  es muy popular y querida en su  localidad, desde  que  se hizo cargo sola de sus dos queridos hijos,  trabaj\u00f3 en diferentes actividades con el fin de  ofrecerles  estudios superiores a fin de que en un  futuro tengan  mejores oportunidades  de trabajo.Do\u00f1a Genoveva actualmente  tiene un peque\u00f1o puestito de golosinas  en una concurrida   avenida de la ciudad de Juliaca, adicionalmente a esta labor   los fines de semana  se dedica  al negocio de compra y venta de peluches americanos; gracias a su  empe\u00f1o y sobre todo  voluntad de superaci\u00f3n en las dos actividades a las que se dedica esta logrando obtener buenos resultados pero cree que con mayor presupuesto de inversi\u00f3n podr\u00eda mejorar considerablemente  sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":171073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase capital to increase the variety of her products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-06-17T15:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-05T05:00:55Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-08-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":254.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286808},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":254.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317045},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-06T07:09:48Z","rounded_local_amount":254.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348794},{"amount":86,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":248.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335149},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":252.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956327},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":252.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226584}],"funded_date":"2008-06-21T05:00:55Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":56750,"name":"Mujeres Solidarias Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oneida M.

She learned the trade as a young girl and has now acquired many skills.\r\nShe worked as a street vendor before starting this business, but seeing that she needed to improve her living conditions and the quality of life of her two children, she decided to relocate her business to her home. Despite the economic difficulties she has faced, she has come out ahead.

From a very early age he devoted himself to the junkyard (collecting scrap metal), but the business did not do well, so he decided to go into the retail business. He now sells fuel and telephone lines, and has been doing it successfully for a year. What he likes about this business is that it keeps him busy and it is not very tiring, compared to his previous business of collecting scrap metal. This business has been very profitable because fuel and telephone lines are now popular retail items, guaranteeing him a steady income.  His customers are hard working people who have steady incomes as well.  In the future, Carlos wants to have a grocery store.

Freddie has been engaged in his business for over 10 years, and he earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Freddie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services that would help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Freddie is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to invest in his business's expansion. This loan will be Freddie's first loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

They have a 5-year-old child who goes to primary school. Felix Ruben has worked as a teacher for more than 16 years. They live in a humble house, since teacher salaries in the country are very low. Thus, they do not have the economic resources to repair some imperfections in their home. For this reason, they are requesting a new loan to build a wall behind their home, with the aim of separating their yard from that of their neighbor, and also to protect the family from the crime that is threatening the population of the area. This is the main reason for their request, which will favor the socioeconomic well-being of all members of the family in the future. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman,

It\u2019s also known for the presence of the Cerro de Oro hydroelectric dam.\r\n\r\nAndrea M. lives here.  She is 45 years old and only has a third grade education because her parents didn\u2019t have the money to provide more.  She\u2019s married to Guillermo who works as a field hand.  They have two children who attend the local school.\r\n\r\nAndrea says that she\u2019s been working in her own business, selling fish, for more than ten years, because she wants to help her husband provide for the family and the children\u2019s education.  She tells us that she sells on the weekends and rises early in the morning to buy the fish at the edge of the dam.   She takes it home to clean and then goes out to the local communities, like Tierra Blanca, Pescadito, and La Granja to sell to her customers.

It\u2019s also quite heavily populated.  \r\n\r\nJuan tells us about the difficulties he\u2019s had with his store.  The first, he says, is that the suppliers that send him food to sell often send him items that are already passed their sell by dates and sometimes items that don\u2019t sell at all.  This affects him quite a bit and reflects in his low sales.  Because of this, he prefers to invest in items that do sell well, like eggs, beans, soup and rice, milk, soft-drinks and water.  \r\n\r\nThe loan is going to help him so that people will return to buy and find in his store what they are looking for; this will lead to better sales for him.  He also aims to buy a display case because he\u2019s hoping to start to sell cold cuts because he thinks that he\u2019ll do very well with this because there are no stores in his community selling cold cuts.  Everyone wants these products and they have to go all the way to the main town to get them and that\u2019s a waste of time and money.\r\n\r\nJuan is married and has four children but only two are still dependent.  He\u2019s been married for 25 years and is 52 years old.  He lives in his own house and his wife\u2019s a housewife.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":820070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries to stock his Conasupo (National Company of Popular Susbsitence items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T21:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan De Dios","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1258.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201880},{"amount":159.38,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1887.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807472},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1258.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618566},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":629.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572810}],"funded_date":"2011-08-15T21:14:59Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":328042,"name":"Caroline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Caroline is 37 years old and widowed with two children aged eight and 17.

Nepal, large supermarkets are rare. Instead, most items can be found in the small, densely packed pasals that line the streets of every city and village. Piled high with utensils, paper goods, and anything else one would need, these stores are your one-stop shop in Nepal. Although usually packed into a space no larger than 100 square feet, these stores carry a sizeable and diverse inventory.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of a Kiva loan, pasal owners are able to keep inventory up and their customers happy. Competition is fierce, but with extra capital and a bit of creativity, the opportunity for profit is there.\r\n\r\nBabita is 33 years-old. She is married and has one child, age 4.  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, she established her kitchen utensil store business.

She is 42 years old, married, and has three children aged 23, 13, and 7.  The youngest two children are in the state school.  Luzmila was a street vendor for a long time and then she rented a booth and began to sell fruit, but the business did not profit and she ended up wasting a lot.  She realized that there were more opportunities for her to sell condiments and it would be more profitable for her.  Luzmila needs a loan of 1,200 soles (USD$400) to purchase vinegar, soy sauce and cheese at wholesale prices.  \r\n\r\nSince Luzmila has been a part of FINCA she has been able to increase her stock, has received business advice, and now knows how to administrate her own business.
