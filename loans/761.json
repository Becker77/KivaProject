His parents owned some agricultural machinery (tractor T-40, trailer, plow, cultivator) and five hectares of agricultural land (two hectares of orchard and three hectares of arable land). They acquired the machinery and land as a result of privatization after the dissolution of the collective farm (kolkhoz). \r\n\r\nDinu has leased another six hectares of orchards and seven hectares of arable land, so he cultivates 18 hectares of land in total. In 2012, Dinu purchased on credit a tractor (MTZ-82), which cost 300 000 MDL, and a second-hand water tank at a cost of 30 000 MDL. \r\n\r\nDinu also needs a disc harrow, which he has been leasing from other farmers, making it difficult to carry out the work on time. He is praying for help from Kiva lenders. The disc harrow costs 80,000 MDL which is equivalent to US$5,600. Dinu has requested a loan of US$3,000, to add to US$2,600 of his own.

Her husband, who does not have a full-time job anymore, is no longer able to  help her at home.

It is bordered in the north by Tarqui parish, in the south by Jima parish of S\u00edgsig canton and the edge of Gir\u00f3n canton, to the east by the parishes of Quingeo and San Jos\u00e9 in S\u00edgsig canton, and in the west by the parish of Victoria del Portete. The leading economic activity in the area is agriculture, and the most important products are corn, potatoes, beans and milk. A large proportion of the younger population travels daily to Cuenca to work as factory employees, handicraft artisans, store employees, service workers and above all, construction workers. \n\nMar\u00eda Auxiliadora is  48 years old and lives with her two younger children, aged 15 and 12, who attend a nearby school. Her other four children are married and independent. Her husband is a mason, and through many years of sacrifice, he was able to build the family's own home in the Cumbe community. \n\nMar\u00eda Auxiliadora was one of the founding members of the communal bank, and she has been with the bank for fifteen years. She was inspired by a neighbor who belonged to an earlier group in the neighborhood which broke up. Later, this new group of hard-working and enterprising women was formed. Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora's business is buying and selling animals. She deals in guinea pigs and hens at the Cumbe markets and at Cuenca's public market. This activity has allowed her to advance economically. She has worked for 20 years in the markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and on the other days, she takes care of her animals. She also keeps cows, whose milk she sells to mobile distributors. With the current loan, she will buy more guinea pigs and hens to resell. \n\nHer goal is to expand her business day by day and reach the point where she can buy herself a vehicle. \n\nLuz Fern\u00e1ndez lives in the \"3 de Noviembre\" community of the Cumbe parish. She is  60 years old and was widowed 18 years ago when her husband was killed in a traffic accident. The couple had four children, who are now grown and married. Luz lives in her own house with one of her daughters who keeps her company and shares the household expenses. \n\nLuz works in agriculture; she grows corn, potatoes and a variety of vegetables. She also keeps cattle, selling the milk to mobile distributors. In addition, she raises guinea pigs and chickens. She tells us that she has been a member of the communal bank since its beginnings, that is, for the past 15 years. The loans have been beneficial for her business of buying and selling animals. With the new loan, she will buy chickens, guinea pigs and feed for her animals, as well as seeds for corn, beans, peas and other crops. \n\nHer goal is to continue working as long as her health permits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

She lives in a peri-urban area on the outskirts of Guayaquil called Duran which is known for its deteriorating ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAna began selling meals with some savings she had and her previous experience in the business.  She decided to set up her own lunch business.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,000. Ethel is now borrowing PHP 11,000 so that she could purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Ethel hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Nelia has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Nelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Nelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She\u2019s been in business for 10 years and the most difficult part is putting up with the intermittent rain storms which sometimes last all day and cause her sales to drop.\r\n\r\nShe mentions that educational costs for her minor children are higher and this is why she\u2019s calling on MFP for a loan.  With the money she gets she\u2019ll travel to the capital to buy more merchandise to stock her sales stand and will use the remaining funds to pay for her beloved children\u2019s monthly tuition.  In time, she\u2019d like to start a new business; she\u2019ll go into food sales, since she\u2019s noticed that this is a good source of income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 7th loan with MFP and she hopes to get support from all of you to be able to buy the merchandise she needs to have more profits.  She thanks her fellow communal bank members for the responsibility they have.  She will use the requested 3000 new soles to buy more shoes and sandals in the city of Lima to increase the stock she has on hand at her store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":820157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more shoes and sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":386.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":397.15},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":411.64},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":426.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":443.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":459.55},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":474.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.76},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":287.38,"local_amount":783.76,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-18T08:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":786.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350776},{"amount":150.93,"local_amount":411.64,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":413.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851140},{"amount":156.45,"local_amount":426.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":428.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666316},{"amount":162.75,"local_amount":443.88,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":445.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621474},{"amount":168.5,"local_amount":459.55,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":461.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835547},{"amount":173.99,"local_amount":474.51,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":476.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245305}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T18:21:49Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":324115,"name":"Carolyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carolyne is 34 years old and married to David.

\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In his business he also takes advantage of each season, so many times he sells school supplies. In December he sells toys and Christmas decorations, but he never stops selling his principal items which are the spare parts for blenders, irons, pots and other small electrical household appliances.

She has always sought to reap the best possible results from her crops and has cared for her animals in order to profit and be able to provide for her 6 children.  In addition to growing corn and peas, Beatriz raises sheep, cows, pigs, hens, and guinea pigs.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n<P>First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and add more as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing, they produce eggs. You can sell the eggs to provide a supplementary source of income, or eat them to provide a supplementary source of protein. There are probably many other reasons for raising kuku, but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n<p>Bernadetha requests a loan to purchase additional chicks and feed so she can increase her income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her husband, Arman have four young children who range from two to four years in age and the family lives in the village of Tabao Rizal. San Enrique, Negros Occidental. \n\nAdela is 39 years old and has established herself as a skillful entrepreneur for almost 10 years since she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999. When she got her first loan, she invested it in food vending of Native Ilonggo delicacies such as \"bayi-bayi\" and \"kalamayhati\" which are made of rice flour, whole brown sugar and coconut milk.Over the years, her food products have become quite popular in the community to the point where the increased demand has required her husband to help with production and delivery. Larger loans made it possible for Adela to establish a networking business as well. Her income has grown to an average of PHP 10,000 per month, which has enabled her to fix her dilapidated house and set aside some savings for her children's future .Adela's products taste so good that it was selected by NWTF's Client Services Department to be one of the sugar-based products it featured in a week-long trade fair that it organized in August at SM City Bacolod, the biggest mall in Negros Occidental.  Her products were so well received by the mall shoppers that it she will be offering them again in the trade-fair rerun at SM City Bacolod this October during the Masskara Festival, which is a famous tourist event in the island.  It is expected to be one of the best and fast selling products in the trade fair.She borrowed PHP 19,500 for her previous loan and used it as additional working capital for her food vending and networking business. That loan was fully paid on time. For her next 14th cycle loan she wants to borrow the same amount of PHP 19,500 which she intends to use again as additional capital for her native foods vending and networking business.Adela is shown in the picture posing with some of the networking products that she sells.About NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

One of them is in his fourth year of secondary school, and the other is 27 years old.  Martha has a cosmetic sales business, which she began four years ago with very little working capital, in search of an alternative source of income, since she also gives classes in a public school.  She began by selling just a few cosmetics.  Afterwards, she started to invest a little more.  This credit will be invested in the purchase of lipstick, polish, eyeshadow cases, and vanity boxes.

It is a very popular trade in Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nIvon is seeking a 40,000 LKR loan from BRAC to buy more coir to process and sell to her currently-expanding base of customers.

With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

P., 44, life couldn't be simpler. Being a CCT* community partner of Talon, Amadeo, Cavite, Philippines, Merlita employs simple but effective principles to make her business grow. She is the wife of Orlando, a laborer, and is a mother to two college students.\r\n\r\nMerlita owns a sari-sari (variety) store in her neighborhood, where she sells items that are daily needed by people in her community. When a neighbor immediately needs a bottle of vinegar, a sachet of toothpaste, or some biscuits to eat, Merlita is ready to offer her merchandise. She also sells electronic load for mobile phones. Monthly, she earns around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Merlita is requesting for a Php20,000 loan. This is one simple way of energizing her business--adding to the array of items she has in her store to attract more customers with more options and to further meet their needs. She believes that with this loan money, she can undoubtedly increase her profits and make her store grow.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Merlita faces recently is the number of customers who do not pay their debts. She is also challenged by competition in the neighborhood, since many households in the Philippines put up a small sari-sari store to augment the family income. However, Merlita believes that challenges can be met by simply having faith in the Lord and exerting her best effort. She does not give up, because she knows that soon, the days will be brighter for her, both in her personal life and in her business. Just like any other parent, Merlita's simple dream is to see her children finish schooling.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":666709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Together they try to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been selling nutritional products for 15 years.  She also currently sells purified water by the glass.  The water has the effect of lowering weight which means that she has more women as customers than men.  It is currently summer which means that her business is very popular.

What she most likes about her business is the guidance that she gives to her customers since she really enjoys chatting to her customers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda plans to diversify her business, buying a sewing machine so that she can realize her frustrated dreams of becoming a seamstress and mending clothes.

Los 4 viven en una casa propia en la comunidad nativa de Pucharini. Magaly e Iv\u00e1n se dedican a la agricultura desde que empezaron a convivir, con la siembra de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tanos, frutas c\u00edtricas, papayas, yucas y cocona. A parte de eso Magaly prepara anticuchos y los vende por las noches en la puerta de su hogar. Por su parte Iv\u00e1n, cuando no est\u00e1 en el campo, trabaja en construcci\u00f3n civil de carreteras y obras p\u00fablicas. Por la lejan\u00eda de sus terrenos, el acceso para llegar sus cosechas, dificulta y demora el traslado de las mismas, por esa raz\u00f3n no dudan al momento de contratar personal, siendo para ellos uno de sus principales obst\u00e1culos dentro de su actividad. M\u00e1s adelante le gustar\u00eda abrir un negocio en el que compre pl\u00e1tanos al por mayor de los comuneros de su zona e introducirlos en la ciudad de Lima para venderlos a mayor precio.

They have two children who are now 6 and 3 years of age.  The four of them live in their own home in their native community of Pucharini.  Magaly and Iv\u00e1n have been farming since they have been together.  They grow coffee, bananas, citrus fruits, papayas, cassava, and coconuts.  In addition, Magaly prepares grilled meats and then sells them in the evenings from the doorstep of her home.  When he is not working in the fields, Iv\u00e1n works in highway construction and on other public projects.  Due to the distance it takes to get to their land, accessing and transporting their crops can be difficult and result in delays.  For this reason, they do not hesitate to hire workers since this is one of the main obstacles of this business.  Going forward, Magaly would like to open a business selling bananas in bulk from the local villagers and introducing them into the city of Lima where she can sell them at a higher price.  By her calculations, this venture would be profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nThis would be her fourth loan with MFP once she receives everyone\u2019s support.  Magaly promises to complete her payments on time and work hand-in-hand with the organization and her Communal Bank, where she feels supported and trusted.

She is from Kitale, Kenya where the earth is red and smells fresh from the rain. The trees are lush, and tiny, matchbox-like, mud brick houses with tin roofs line both sides of the dirt roads. For the past 27 years, Jane has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and some personal business she engages in to make extra cash. \r\n\r\nJane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She passionately loves poultry farming. \u201cChicken is part of me. I sleep chicken, I walk chicken, I love chicken, I eat chicken,\u201d she says. The biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy additional poultry birds. She requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to purchase high-quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. She believes the excess maize she has will be used to feed the poultry, and sorghum will be used to give the poultry energy and green grams used for protein. \r\n\r\nThrough better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs of good quality, which will translate to more income. With this loan Jane will also benefit from fertilizer as the droppings have a lot of nitrogen. With the additional income, Jane will be able to support her family and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1821945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":992880,"name":"Macu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Macu is a 20-year-old woman living in Bundibugyo-Uganda.

From a tender age, she began all sorts of businesses, but finally decided to specialize in the buying and selling of Soumbala (a natural seasoning of multiple virtues made from the African locust nut) which she learned early on from her grandmother (as do most women of her ethnicity: the Minianka). She has been selling out of her home for 20 years. To secure complementary financial resources, she has turned to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for the last 4 years. After having properly repaid her previous loans (3 group loans and 2 individual loans), she is on her third individual loan. Mrs. Nanou plans to buy with this loan 40 baskets of semi-transformed Soumbala in Koutiala at the weekly fairs from women coming from the villages. Afterwards, she fully transforms it in her way to make it more presentable with several employees. She sells her goods in the city of Bamako (capital of Mali) and Koutiala to a female clientele for cash or credit. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 140,000 CFA francs, which she plans to use to repay the loan and take care of her children. She plans to look for a spot at the Dabanani market in Bamako in order to grow her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva

Her husband is the one who focuses on the business, while she helps him in his activities.\r\n\r\nAccording to Elizabeth, her loan from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc.

She will use her 5th loan again to buy things needed in expanding their fish cage.\r\n\r\nElizabeth together with her husband hopes that their children will finish their studies; they believe in the

G. es se\u00f1or de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, el cual vive   con su esposa y su hijo, en una comunidad llamada El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica.

G. is 43 years old. He lives with his wife and son in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nFray is a milk producer. This way he obtains an income to support his family. He says he's very happy because due to this project he has been able to make a living. He sells his milk to the cheese manufacturing company that works for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association.\r\nFray would like to get a \u00a2640.00 loan (six hundred and forty colones) to purchase a milking cow and increase the production of milk. He wants to be a successful entrepreneur to help his family. This motivates him to make sacrifices and work hard.\r\n\r\nFray is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan. He hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. He also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations she is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She lives in her own house with her family, and is not financially responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe moved from Inhambane to Namaacha when her husband was transferred, and they set up a new home where they still live today. She's had her own business for more than 20 years. She doesn't have employees, and relies on her husband for assistance. She sells cornmeal, tomatoes, and onions, and brings in about 5000 meticals, which she reinvests in her business. She is not able to save anything and depends on her husband's pension.\r\n\r\nShe's never had loans with other institutions. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client. This is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. She is requesting 15,000 meticals to buy essentials and increase the amount of stock she can carry.\r\n\r\nShe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that she'll be eligible for others in the future. Her dream is to have her own shop, and will request additional loans to prepare a space in her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Bukang Liwayway, Brgy. Tanglaw, Puerto Princesa, Palawan. She earns her living by operating four business ventures: building rental, pension houses, tricycle operator and a general store.  \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 23,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for building maintenance that will be very helpful in her business and to continue to save up for future house renovation. Erlinda H. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to Arbi G., a mechanic, and she is the mother to their four children. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLorna operates a variety store where she also does a little direct selling of cosmetics, clothing and footwear. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of $9.50 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nLorna hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to be able to help her neighbors and community through her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":715860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She owns a car in which her sole employee drives customers to their desired destinations. Matha currently earns US$ 75 from her business and is requesting a loan of US$ 275 that she intends to put towards the repair and maintenance of her car. She hopes that this will allow her to rent out her car for more hours each day and therefore earn increased profits. \r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P> Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.

She inherited several plots of land from her father and since she married, has worked with her husband growing potatoes, peas, and corn.  She likes the peas best because they take the least work and provide enough for three harvests.  She takes care of her plants each day looking for evidence of mosquitoes or other pests.  If she finds pests, she fumigates the leaves until they have grown and flowered in a uniform way so she can then relocate them.  Mercedes likes to work on her plot of land and is proud of it for producing well. Thanks to its production, they have been able to build a house and are now putting on the final additions so they can live comfortably with their children. \r\n\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP.  She has proven herself punctual with her payments on her former loans.  In addition, she has been the treasurer for her communal bank for the past five cycles.  She is very efficient and her fellow members want her to continue being treasurer.

In the early morning hours, Virginia carries her merchandise from her modest home to one of the busiest markets in their district.  She works as a travelling merchant and her income enables her to pay for her family\u2019s expenses.  Virginia enjoys her work, which allows her the freedom to establish her own schedule and devote time to her children and her housework.  Sometimes the job can be tiring because she works Monday through Sunday.  Fortunately, sales have been good and Virginia expects her business will continue growing.

Karina Villegas; they have two beautiful children, the youngest of whom is just three weeks old.  They are very responsible and dedicated to their work.\r\n\r\nEdwin and his family live in the city of Cochabamba in the Maica Central community, in his parents' house.  His main activity is the production of raw milk which is delivered to a firm that produces dairy products.  They currently have 10 head of dairy cattle.  Edwin also works at a motorcycle repair shop.\r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to buy forage for his cows because the price of farm supplies rises during this season.\r\n\r\nAmong his dreams and goals is to increase the number of cows so that milk production will increase.  One of his most important dreams is to finish building his house since his parents willed him a piece of property on which they already have begun to build in order to give him a house in which each of his children can have a bedroom; currently they are quite uncomfortable in their parents' house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

Virginia has been a client of our institution since 2007.  She owns a restaurant in the Villa Salome area, a business that she has operated for some time and knows well.  Her husband used to own a pool hall but he sold it and opened another restaurant in Pampahasi, a suburb east of La Paz.  \r\n\r\nBoth businesses are thriving because they are well known in their respective areas.  The couple has a 2 year old daughter and they live in Pampahasi.  Pampahasi, on the eastern side of La Paz, is considered both a residential neighborhood and a tourist destination.  In the last nine years, the town has grown enormously and conditions for its 30,000 inhabitants have improved, as well.  \r\n\r\nFrom the edge of the town, at the Segundo Cruce bridge near the border with Villa San Antonio, you can see impressive buildings of up to four floors with finished facades, along paved streets and wide avenues, lined with green lawns and open areas.\r\n\r\nThe town has 16 neighborhoods in three zones: Bajo Pampahasi (Illimani-San Juan), Centro (Venus Fields) and Alto (Said-Crus Pata, ex SAMAPA, Cerveceria and La Guardia).  It's here that the two live alone because their family is in the country.  The loan that she is applying for will be used to buy the building where the restaurant operates (using a uniquely Bolivian form of property ownership).  The purchase will allow her to avoid paying a monthly rent.  Virginia is a responsible and hard-working person.  She is grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust they've place in her by extending this loan.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite being 59 years old, she does not let age prevent her from having a life.  Hilda is motivated to succeed by her only son Jos\u00e9, who is 40 years old and lives in a populous district in the southern part of the city.  Things have not been easy for her, but she perseveres with great effort and dedication.  She continues working in order to move forward.\r\n<p>\r\nFor six years, Hilda has been waking up early to prepare breakfast in her caf\u00e9 that is situated next to another business.  She serves many people on a daily basis and also sells other products from her establishment, such as candy and soft drinks.  In the afternoons, she offers lunch to her customers.  Hilda takes very little rest because she enjoys her work so much and finds it both entertaining and profitable.  Most of the time she works alone, but sometimes her niece comes by to help in the mornings when there are more people.  Hilda has plans to expand her business and restock it with more supplies so that her customers leave satisfied.  Additional revenue would provide her a good quality of life and enable her to help her grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though this will be her first loan with MFP, Hilda knows that she must make her payments on time.  She has demonstrated she is responsible by successfully raising her only son.

With a loan, some of them can buy pieces of furniture;  some will pay either their children\u2019s school fees or pay for themselves to pursue further studies; others will use theirs to either start building a house or complete the building process; and others will use theirs in business to supplement their monthly salaries. \r\n\r\nHellen (second from right) is the head teacher at the school.

She is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRuth is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling dried fish in the local communities. Ruth has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ruth joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC and is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Ruth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and save for future needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

This loan will allow her to satisfy a larger portion of her family\u2019s needs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":506666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"increase her working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T09:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maguette ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":11934.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759276},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":17902.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790787},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":5967.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971222},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-24T08:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11934.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708493},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":11934.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189398}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T10:36:31Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":188953,"name":"Doreen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doreen is a 28-year-old mother of two children aged 8 and 4 years old.

Catarman I, Cordova, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 5 business ventures: a Sari-Sari (General) Store, Ready to Wear (RTW), Electronic Re-loading, Water Vending and another retailing business. Her husband, Arnel I., who is 39 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 16 and 20 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeonida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she wished for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Leonida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000 which she intends to use for additional funds for her business. Her goals are to continue to save for the future, let her children finish their studies and to expand the businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nLeonida I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. (Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable.) Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has three children, aged 26, 22 and 17.  In 1998, she established her cow-raising business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family. In the future, Goma plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  \r\n\r\nThe purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates: BPW Partner Page.

Together with them he resides in the Las Vegas community of the municipality of Trojes. Don Ubaldo and his family devote themselves to growing coffee, and also have a small grocery store, as well as growing bananas and corn on a small scale. He is a humble and very hardworking man. He began growing coffee 12 years ago and learned it from his family. He has some laborers who help him with the work on the farm, and he and his son also join in on the efforts. His work schedule begins at 6 a.m. and ends at 12 p.m. The advantage to coffee growing is that it is a primary product for exportation and very important to the country. The disadvantage is that often Don Ubaldo has not sold his product at the price he should have, because of the out-of-control actions of illegal middlemen who want to buy the product at a super low price and then take it to other countries, where they sell it for as much as five times more than they paid for it. \r\n\r\nHe also must deal with the fact that at harvest time labor is scarce, and this has caused him some losses, but in spite of everything, Don Ubaldo has always kept going without giving up. He needs the loan he is seeking for fertilizing and clearing over ten acres of farmland. With the support of the loan he will improve his crops, since the fertilization of the soil will be done at an appropriate time, and his family's living conditions will be improved.
