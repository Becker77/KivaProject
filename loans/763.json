L. B. is 29 and has five kids. She raises pigs and will use this loan to purchase a cow to raise for milk production and to finance feed and care for the pigs.  This is her first loan with Friendship Bridge, and like most of the women doing their first credit, it's a bit scary. It's stressful to think of those loan payments, but she decided to go ahead with the loan anyway.  Her dream is to buy a few more calves and raise them. The remote village where she lives has lots and lots of pastureland, and the people make good use of it, raising lots of sheep, goats, and cattle.  Teresa's picture doesn't show her animals because she pastures them more than an hour's walk away, and it was not practical to visit them.<p>Like many people in her area, money has been hard to come by. There have been times when there just wasn't enough and Teresa has had to borrow from her neighbors. She has successfully paid them back, though.<p>Teresa is a member of the women's group Nueva Vision, or New Vision. Most of the women in her group, even the younger ones, cannot read, write, or speak Spanish. They primarily stay with their traditional ways and speak their native Ixil language. Until very recently, almost all the houses in this remote village were made of wood, a very poor building material for this area, but now most are of concrete block and adobe.

Nora sells meals for a living.  Her stand is located near a commuter stop and a busy roadway, which guarantees her a secure income.  Every day she makes the effort to get up very early in the morning to prepare food since she sells breakfasts and lunches to very discerning customers, usually drivers who work for the nearby transportation companies.  The meals that Nora makes are delicious and of high quality.  After 20 years of supporting herself with this business, she would like to improve upon it and widen the selection of meals and beverages for her customers.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she looks forward to joining all of the members of the communal bank in their solidary work.  With the money that she is requesting, she will set herself up with the necessary items to sell fruit juices.  First she will buy a blender, a juicer, and an extractor.  With the rest of the money, she will buy the fruits she needs to meet this new challenge.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":274925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Outfit her business for selling fruit juices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T22:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117122},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012035},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595621},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989882},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211014},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640511}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T00:42:50Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Wester","image":null}},{"id":94355,"name":"Hermenigildo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio HERMENIGILDO; es natural de la comunidad campesina de Ccolcca, provincia de Quispicanchi \u2013 Ocongate; situada a 3, 900 m.s.n.m, esta a 4 horas en bus de la ciudad del Cusco.\n\nEl Sr: Hermenegildo, realiza trabajos en carpinter\u00eda, hace puertas, marcos de ventanas, mesas, sillas, carpetas, entre otros, el tiene un peque\u00f1o volquete que le permite viajar a la selva de Per\u00fa en busca de madera para efectuar sus trabajos de carpinter\u00eda, es el \u00fanico carpintero en toda la poblaci\u00f3n de Ccolcca,  el invertir\u00e1 el pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de madera, para hacer la elaboraci\u00f3n de puertas y marcos de ventanas de sus vecinos.\n\nEl socio agradece el apoyo brindado y se compromete a cumplir con el pago en las fechas establecidas, el valora este pr\u00e9stamo, que le permite culminar con sus trabajos y de ese modo tendr\u00e1 sus ganancias.\n","en":"Hermenegildo is a native member of the rural community of Ccolcca, in the province of Quispicanchi-Ocongate, which is located 3,900 meters above sea level.

She makes lunches to sell in the \u201cZona Franca\u201d (a governmental organization that regulates exportation from Nicaragua).  She sells food for cash and for credit with weekly payments.  \r\n\r\nShe started her sales with funds that her husband gave her and the support of a friend.  She was able to start selling clothes and shoes, and she had customer orders.  But, sales in the last few months have been bad.  She did not get income, and she had clothes that she did not sell.  That is how the need to sell food emerged.  Every day she sells more.\r\n\r\nThat is why she turns to a loan.  She does not have sufficient capital to make the food.  She will buy meat, rice, beans, dairy products, and fruit to prepare the food and drinks.  \r\n\r\nShe gets up very early to make the different meals.  Her mother helps her.  She has to be en route to transport and deliver the lunch at the exact time.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to buy more plates, cups, and spoons among other things.  Now that her food sales have increased, she will also start to buy clothes.  In the Christmas month her customers order clothes for their children, which she gives them credit to buy with the ease of making several payments.\r\n\r\nShe thanks Afodenic for their help in improving her business.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or $167 per week) to continue to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Taumaia joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Taumaia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives there with her husband and two children. \r\n\r\nNoroy sells children's clothing. All the merchandise she offers for sale in her business is trademark quality at affordable prices. \r\n\r\nWhen Noroy launched her enterprise 20 years ago, it was pretty basic. However, she has consistently increased her clientele and the assortment of discount clothing imported from neighboring cities. \r\n\r\nNoroy is seeking a loan of 7,500 TJS to add to her stock and meet the growing demand for clothing. At this point, one of her business goals is to find reliable and accountable suppliers to partner with. \r\n\r\nNoroy has already repaid six loans to IMON International without any delinquencies. We believe her outstanding credit history and willingness to strive for higher goals will help her repay the current loan and reach success in her business.   \r\n  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The fact that they are in their second loan cycle speaks to their sense of reponsibility and punctuality in making their loan payments.  The members, who all live in the same area, are involved in different business activities, including the sale of electrical appliances, cosmetics, groceries and food.  They sell in a neighborhood where there is not much competition in their respective lines of business.  For this reason, their sales frequently generate daily income for the members. The requested loan is intended for investment in the economic and business activities that pay for the group's daily household expenses.  In the future, they hope to increase their earnings and to improve even further the quality of life of their families, providing them with a better education and the possibility of their children attending university. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva

She is 40 years old and is married with six children aged from one year seven months old to 20 years old.  Victoria also cares for a niece.  Many of her children are in school, and their educational levels are nursery school to 7th grade.  Victoria herself only recently finished high school by taking classes at night school.  When she was younger she had to stop her schooling because of poverty.\r\n\r\nVictoria and her family live in the Pipeline Community, and she works in the Red Light Market, Liberia's largest market which is near the capital, Monrovia.  Her business is the sale of fruit, such as plantain, bananas, oranges, etc. She buys her goods from wholesalers and sells retail from a table in the Red Light Market.  She has been running this business for more than 20 years and hopes to become an exporter of Liberian plantain, banana, oranges and other fruit.\r\n\r\nVictoria originally started her business with 500 Liberian Dollars as her working capital but with hard work, her business has grown.  She sells good, ripe fruit in order to encourage her customers to continue buying from her.  Victoria needs this loan to purchase more fruit for her business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of being able to help educate her children so that they have a good foundation for their future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Victoria is the one holding the sign.

From that day forward, his repute swept through town and demand for his product grew.  Orders from his neighbors, as well as from nearby hardware stores (with which he is still in business), were quick to appear.  Thus started his brick factory.

(left), 58 years of age and married, is a resident of Dimalco, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental. Erlinda is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Erlinda B.\u2019s Group. \t\nErlinda is married to Remegio, 63 years old and a farmer. They are blessed with 13 children; 11 are now adults and two are now school age. To help her husband, she decided to operate a retail store. For six years, she has been able to maintain the business. She is earning an average net income of not less than P 3,500 a month, which is very helpful to their family income.  She joined the cooperative in the year 2009. As an active member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she is requesting  P 5,000.00 as her second loan to add capital to her existing sari-sari store business. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family, to meet their basic needs and savings for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive. \n\nAbout PMPC: \n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":539629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional capital for her existing sari-sari store business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tangub-Dimalco, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":380},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":380}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":205841,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 43-year-old married woman from Lebanon with two children.

M. lives in Col. Centro, Axochiapan, in the State of Morelos, in Mexico.  She is 39 years old and completed her basic education.  She will use her loan to expand her business selling sewing supplies, gifts and cuddly toys.  She will use her loan to buy cuddly toys, gift bags, sewing supplies and toys for 'Reyes Magos' (a holiday which is celebrated in Mexico on January 6th, when children receive gifts from 'The Three Kings').  Ruth learned the trade from her dad who had an identical business in Axochiapan town square where he sold gifts.  Since she was small, Ruth used to accompany her dad to buy the merchandise to stock his business and so she knew where to buy products for her business.\r\n\r\nRuth started her business 15 years ago with her husband.  It was an inheritance from her dad.  When she was single she would look after her dad's business and then she started, little by little, selling on a small table outside her home.  When she decided to invest with loans, her business grew and she was able to buy more merchandise with which to stock her business.  It grew gradually.  Now Ruth has her business located in her home.  She feels proud to have her own business and she also tells us that it helps her to cover her household expenses.  She feels happy because, in spite of the fact that there are seasons when her sales are low, her business always makes good profits.\r\n\r\nSome of the challenges that Ruth faces are rising prices and competition.  She tells us that in the fifteen years she has been selling, another four similar businesses have set up in her street.  For this reason, she plans to expand her business through loans from KIVA and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She is thinking of requesting a larger loan so that she can buy more merchandise and have a competitive business.\r\n\r\nRuth is married.  Her husband works from home fixing televisions, modulars, DVD players, etc.  She has two children.  6 year-old Jos\u00e9 Manuel is in elementary school and 14 year-old Yoselin is in high school.  Her husband and her daughter help her in her business, serving customers at different times of day.  She considers that her business has helped her a lot in getting her family ahead in life and making improvements to her home.  She has a number of plans for the future, including expanding her business and putting up a curtain so that her merchandise looks nicer.  She wants to continue enjoying good health and to continue making good sales.  The improvement that she would like to make in her children's futures is for them to want to study.  Other improvements that she would like to make include plastering and painting her house.\r\n\r\nRuth feels very happy with the loan that she received since it has enabled her to grow her business and increase her sales.  She would like to say to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the opportunity.  Above all, thank you for the trust that you place in us since you don't know us and yet you still lend us money.  Thanks to this, we are able to grow our businesses\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":685845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Compra de munecos de peluche, bolsas para regalo, merceria y juguetes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.03,"local_amount":1882.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1961.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430818},{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":1250.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850071},{"amount":106.3,"local_amount":1250.56,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1302.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292345},{"amount":52.37,"local_amount":616.21,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":641.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160603}],"funded_date":"2011-01-08T04:17:00Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":267304,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekua K. is married and has six dependents.

This is 52-year-old Mwanahamisi S., a widow with eight children. She started a business of selling cereals such as maize, millet, sorghum, etc., which are all widely available in Tanzania because the economy is 70% agricultural and these cereals comprise a primary portion of the local diet. She now focuses on selling maize because it is the most marketable, being used to make ugaali, a staple food in this country. She earns about 180 USD in profit monthly from this business. She is requesting a loan to purchase maize in bulk. In the future, she hopes to increase the scale of her business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":204245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy maize in bulk for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-20T02:30:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanahamisi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-04T05:14:03Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347986},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970560},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886777},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436037},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130310},{"amount":69.99,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027141},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613181},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010264},{"amount":70.01,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232575},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":80605,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664391}],"funded_date":"2008-09-20T05:14:03Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":69811,"name":"Nith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nith S., 35, is married with six children living at home in the Kampong Cham province.

Her biggest dream is to finish that construction and later on buy a car, because it's 4km from her house to the closest bus station. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":542515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Construction supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Catembe, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.009167 32.566667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.81},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.22},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.95},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":13.63,"local_amount":454.19,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":459.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916328},{"amount":231.15,"local_amount":7704.94,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":7801.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159878721},{"amount":6.34,"local_amount":211.62,"processed_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:19:09Z","rounded_local_amount":214.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216529470},{"amount":23.95,"local_amount":798.19,"processed_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":808.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221696942},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":831.06,"processed_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":841.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227066479}],"funded_date":"2010-05-21T18:23:50Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:32:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Lucca","image":259290}},{"id":205857,"name":"Carmen Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      La se\u00f1ora Carmen Patricia U. esta agradecida por su cooperaci\u00f3n en el anterior cr\u00e9dito.\nEsta nuevamente solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en el negocio en mercar\u00eda y arreglos de fiestas y ocasiones especiales.

In their community a lot of people are into rice retailing and therefore demand for the rice is low.

She plans to purchase tricycle spare parts and pay for reconditioning.\r\n\r\nVivian also wants to venture into another two business which are selling frozen foods (processed foods) and hog raising. After four months of raising her hogs, they will be sold per kilo, either alive or slaughtered, direct to people in their village.\r\n\r\nVivian thinks that the frozen foods will be salable because everyone in the community is looking for a convenient way of preparing food for their children before they go to school, just like she did for her children when they were still small. Just like other small children in their village, her apos (grandchildren) are always fond of eating processed food such as marinated pork and chicken and that is why she is inspired to include these in the items she will sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":567170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Her dream is for her children to be professionals and for her family to have their own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":685928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"the purchase of fertilizers, herbicides and medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T20:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":209.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420598},{"amount":75,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":209.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839400},{"amount":75,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":209.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201281910},{"amount":75,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":209.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206149879},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":208.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":209.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211222961},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":208.35,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":209.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216501889}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T23:43:41Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":267320,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa B. sells food items and maize in Elmina.

hog raising and a manicure\/pedicure\/weaving business.  She lives in Bantayan, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.  Neria is borrowing PHP 29,000 to fund the operations of her businesses. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.  Neria aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She began her business because her late father believed that girls were not meant for school, so she was not able to attend school. Since her mother was a businesswoman, Lamrana decided to join her, and she has had her business since she was a teenager. She works 10-hour days, seven days a week, and earns about 2,866,000 SLL each month. She has an outdoor stall and the rainy season is her major challenge as she has enough goods to meet her customer\u2019s needs.

She employs a cousin to help her and she gets her supplies wholesale from neighboring villages. \r\n\r\nLamrana is requesting a 4,500,000 SLL loan to purchase groundnuts, benni seeds, and soya beans. She has repaid two previous loans. She feels that her loans are a great help because she cannot do business without money. Lamrana is excited about the status of her business and hopes that her loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 430,000 SLL.  In the future, she plans to build a house.

Sore hari sebelumnya ia menyediakan sayuran yang akan dijual keesokan harinya. Ia membelinya di pengepul di Pasar Badung dengan harga kiloan. Keuntungan yang diperoleh dari usaha ini sebesar Rp 80.000,00\/hari. Hal ini sangat membantu suaminya yang bekerja sebagai sopir taksi dengan penghasilan yang tidak tetap. Siti memiliki 4 orang anak dengan biaya hidup perhari Rp 40.000,00 dan biaya pendidikan anak sebesar Rp 300.000,00 per

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":204264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase traditional African cloth in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-26T11:50:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-10T13:05:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":201512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347988},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":201512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970562},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":201512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886779},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":201512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436039},{"amount":175,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":201512.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130312}],"funded_date":"2008-09-26T13:05:59Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":69827,"name":"Kosar Irshad Masih's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kosar baji is the wife of I.

Now her daughter-in-law helps her sell the stuffed animals and clothes she brings from Lima, .  She also helps her brother, who has a sweater factory.  With her income and earnings she is able to cover the cost of supporting her family and, above all, the six grandchildren that she helps.\r\n\r\nHer biggest desire is to buy a piece of land in Lima and place her own store there where she could sell everything.  This would be something secure because many times her business is down and she does not have sales.  \r\n\r\nWith her recent loan she will buy clothes and other items to take to Huancayo to sell.

She is married with four children, two girls and two boys. Her oldest child is 20 and in the 10th grade, and her youngest is 10 years old and in the fifth grade. Musu herself was only able to complete school through the 9th grade because Liberia's civil war interrupted her schooling in 1990, when she and her family fled from the capital, Monrovia, to Buchanan, a city southeast along the coast.\r\n\r\nMusu cooks and sells food from a table at the Red Light Market. Red Light is Liberia's largest market and is situated on the outskirts of Monrovia. Musu serves dishes such as fufu (cassava porridge) and soup, fish, beef, rice and greens. Before she started making and selling food, Musu sold raw foodstuffs such as rice, beans and cooking oil, but she decided to start selling cooked food to improve her profits.\r\n\r\nMusu plans to use her 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 29,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more ingredients with which to cook. \"I cook nice food,\" she says. She hopes that one day she will be so successful that she's able to open up a big restaurant in its own building, one that has air conditioning and a TV.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Merelini has 3 years of experience in this business.  Merelini needs a loan of WST $1700 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMerelini joined SPBD.This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Merelini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Merelini P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Perise has 1 year of experience in this business.  Perise needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Perise joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Perise's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

breeding. He worked as an engineer at an agro-technical company for 40 years and was known as a very steady and responsible person. Unfortunately, pensions in rural areas are low and people need to find an additional means of subsistence to live on. For this reason, Shamshibek\u2019s family decided to engage in cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nAs Shamshibek was born into a farmer\u2019s family and had wide experience in animal breeding, he started this activity with great enthusiasm. He used his initial capital of only 5,000 soms (KGS) to buy cattle and managed to increase the number. Also, Shamshibek began to cultivate sunflowers and perennial herbs which serve as concentration of forage for his cattle. With the revenue, Shamshibek gave a good education to his children which allowed them to successfully manage their lives. \r\n\r\nNow Shamshibek plans to use this loan of 80,000 KGS to buy more cattle for fattening and reselling.

She is 43 years old. Lorenza is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Lorenza owns & operates a general retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Lorenza is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lorenza joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lorenza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2,000 PHP from GDMPC. Lorenza is requesting a new loan of 2,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Lorenza from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His services include lawn maintenance and snow removal. Lee Ray and his five employees serve the people around his neighborhood, mostly consisting of senior citizens. To him, these are the most important clients because he enjoys serving them. One of the biggest challenges for the business has been keeping up with payroll during this tough economic time when people are pulling back on spending. One day, Lee Ray wants to be a distributor and expand into selling lawn equipment, salt, etc, out of his own storefront.\r\n\r\nThis loan from Accion USA will help Lee Ray purchase a special type of snow plow and eco-friendly salt product for the upcoming winter season. Winter is Lee Ray\u2019s busiest time of year because snow removal services are so demanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva Detroit and in partnership with Michigan Corps and ACCION USA. Kiva Detroit is the first Kiva City, a program where Kiva works with community organizations and field partners in the United States to provide local small businesses with microloans. Michigan Corps is the first community organization to work with Kiva in Detroit, and conducts outreach through small business networks, churches, community foundations, and across many personal and social media networks.

They live in nuclear families in the Fana sous-prefecture (second administrative region of Mali). The Danaya group participates in diverse activities, from the production of non-alcoholic beverages and powdered juice, and the selling of local plants to the purchase and selling of pagne wax (a highly-prized fabric in Africa), as well as rugs.\r\nTo prepare ginger juice, they crush the ginger into a paste. For two kilograms of ginger paste, 10 litres of water, 5 kilograms of sugar, and flavoring are added. Afterwards the mixture is filtered with a sieve and then put into packets which will be placed into a refrigerator before they are sold.\r\nWanting to increase the size of their business, the women have decided to collaborate with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program with which they are on their fifth group (or solidarity) loan. All of their previous loans were repaid in full.\r\nThe current loan will be used to purchase 20 rugs measuring four square meters each and 50 pieces of pagne wax, 200 kilograms of sugar, 50 kilograms of dah (dried hibiscus leaves), 50 kilograms of ginger, colorings, and plastic packets.\r\nThe members of the Danaya group who sell the pagne wax and the rugs get their stock at the Bobo Dioulasso market (in Burkina Faso). These pagne wax (precut into three pieces) as well as the rugs are sold for cash and on credit with monthly payments.\r\nAs for the makers of the non-alcoholic beverages, they stock up at the Fana market and sell their products at the same market at retail prices for cash to a client base comprised mainly of women, stallkeepers, and children. They each hope to make 25,000 FCFA in profit per cycle (which is an average of four weeks) which will be used to help their husbands pay for their children\u2019s educational expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":224531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of pagne wax, rugs, and ingredients to make non-alcoholic beverages (from sugar, powdered juice, ginger, dah packets, flavorings, etc)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah Diallo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":154803.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889472},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:43Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440265},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:10:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135633},{"amount":100,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":51601.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033434}],"funded_date":"2009-01-02T03:18:57Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Manuel Carreiro","image":null}},{"id":78051,"name":"Nilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nilda se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n de masitas y las vende en las tiendas.
