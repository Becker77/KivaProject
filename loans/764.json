Mr. Sowanou H.\u2019s business is the production and sale of the local drink, \u201csodabi,\u201d which is very popular in the region. The quality of the drink he produces has led to him receiving orders from as far as the capital, Lom\u00e9. In order to be able to produce a large quantity of sodabi, he must be able to buy enough palm trees. To do so he would need substantial financial means, something which Mr. H. does not have.

She prepares all the regional favorites of her hometown of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa including chicken soups, \u201cpuca picante\u201d which is a dish containing beans, peanuts, beets and potatoes, and \u201cmodongo\u201d a favorite weekend dish that contains corn and beef and cooks all night long. Although she cooks a variety of foods, Marizta\u2019s specialty is \u201cchicharr\u00f3n,\u201d which is deep fried pork. This she sells just around the corner from her home in a busy market area. \u201cMari,\u201d as her friends and neighbors call her, sells here during the weekdays and her stand has become a very popular attraction for all in the area. Her second stand is set up in the rural countryside of Ayacucho, a few hours outside the city limits. Because it is very popular for families to take a relaxing day trip to the country during the weekends, Maritza has taken advantage of the weekend traffic, selling a wider variety of dishes to many passersby. Maritza also travels to all the festivals in the area, selling to the large celebrating crowds. \r\n<p>\r\nOne day, Maritza says she would love to open a large restaurant in the city center of Ayacucho. This has been a dream of hers since she was a young girl, she explains, as cooking has always been her passion. This is where her village bank comes in. Two years ago, Maritza began taking out loans to increase her business and her profits, helping her circle in on the eventual accomplishment of the opening of her restaurant. She has loved being a part of her village bank because she says it has taught her how to save her money in the bank where it accumulates interest.

With receipt of the first loan, she invested in renovating the livestock pens and buying more pigs to raise.  Her husband works as a construction worker to supplement the famiL.\u2019s income.  Thanks to the livestock business doing well, and thanks to the extra income from her husband, the famiL.\u2019s income has reached 3,500,000 VND per month.  To buy more sows for breeding and more wheat for use as livestock feed, she hopes to receive the requested loan of 9,000,000 VND.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u00fd n\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i.

She works with zeal as a single parent to support her family and provide for her children's schooling. She is a fishmonger and also sells used clothes. She sells her wares in a shed in the local market square. She procures her goods from wholesale fishmongers in the towns of Yeji and Mankessim. She has been in business for twenty-five years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her son is 2 years old and her daughter is only a year old. Both of them need her full-time attention and Asma takes care of them very well.\r\n \r\nHer husband, M. A., is a driver by profession who rents a rickshaw that he drives. Through the rickshaw, he provides transport to passengers and receives his fares according to the distance of the destinations. He has been in this profession for 9 years.  \r\n\r\nAsma has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy a rickshaw and start his own transportation business.  Driving a rented rickshaw is disadvantageous because it is not always available for him to drive for longer hours.  With his own rickshaw, he can set his schedule to earn maximum income. \r\n\r\nAsma is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her third loan application. In previous loans, she has maintained good credit and never missed a meeting.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the woman holding a book (the Asasah Passbook) is

With this loan, she hopes to buy two bags of maize to use in preparing her \"akpan\", a dish of which the local population eats a great deal. The bags of maize that are sold in Togo are very large, weighing about as much as a normal person would, and the cost of transport further explains the relatively big loan she is requesting. This will allow her to expand her sales, earn more, and better cater for the needs of her children. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>K.

Erika is a very enthusiastic young woman and wants to get ahead in life.  Even though she has a college degree, she hasn't been able to get a job in her field and that's why she currently sells beauty products.  Erika is from Lima but moved to Juliaca seven years ago to go to school.  She works all day selling her products, since her income directly depends on the amount of orders she receives.  What she likes most about her work is interacting with and talking to her customers, convincing them to buy her products.  Her least favorite aspect is going door to door to collect the money.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her children are between the ages of 13 and 25 years old. Helena and her husband  hope to give their children a quality education to the university level. \r\n\r\nHer business is located at the busy Mwingi market, though she is served by the Thika branch office. Thika is the region in Kenya known for production of pineapples. She operates a restaurant known by the name of Corner Cafe. She has been in this business for five years and has two employees. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is high prices for food items making food unaffordable to some customers.

","en":"Francisco L. A. lives in the department of Ahuachap\u00e1n together with his wife and their son. Francisco is 46 years old and is dedicated to his business, which is a metals and carpentry workshop. Francisco produces furniture for every room including dining sets and sells all of this himself. Clients come to Francisco's business to buy furniture sets and Francisco offers them easy forms of payment, which is where Francisco sees a strong niche for his business and why he is inclined to add more of this type of products to a warehouse and still offer ease of payment. This is the dream of this man, that his business grows and that he may be able to have a larger inventory for display, but for the moment, he is requesting a loan because his clients have requested a great quantity of furniture and he does not have the raw materials to make it all.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva

The plans of her family include finishing construction of their house.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past 13 years, she has worked for MARENA (the government agency responsible for the environment and natural resources).  Her greatest challenge is earning a salary that is insufficient to pay for the construction of their house.  She chose to pursue financing and has been happy with the support AFODENIC has provided.  This is her second loan and will be used to install a floor that will improve her family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The reason why she has stayed so long in the program is that CEVI has affected her life.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Working seven days a week and 16 hours a day, she earns about 1,700,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Aminata requires a loan in order to buy more food and drinks for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 200,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Aminata plans to send her children to the University of Sierra Leone.

He lives with his wife and a son on their land and they all work on together. He admits he once was not on the right path as he drank excessively. He is now a religious man after suffering an accident where he lost an eye. He hopes to invest his money in fertilizer and seeds for the fields. He is a very hard worker who saves in order to one day send his son to college. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

Selain itu sisa pinjaman juga digunakan untuk membeli pakan babi. Setelah 5 bulan dipelihara Ketut menjual anak-anak babi dari induk peliharaanya dan berhasil mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 200.000,- per bulannya. Itu belum termasuk keuntungan dari penjualan 3 ekor babi penggemukan modalnya sendiri. Selanjutnya pada pinjaman kedua dengan jangka waktu sama yaitu 6 bulan, Ketut akan menambah 4 ekor bibit penggemukan dan tetap memelihara induknya juga. Nantinya dengan penambahan populasi babi ini akan diperoleh hasil yang lebih bagus lagi dari sebelumnya sehingga pinjaman DINARI juga bisa dikembalikan pada akhir periode pinjaman dan bisa segera dilanjutkan lagi dengan pinjaman selanjutnya. Karena hasil dari beternak babi ini sangat menjanjikan bagi Ketut Sitri dalam meningkatkan perekonomian keluarganya.","en":"Ni Ketut Sitri is a very diligent housewife.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 45 years old. Warlito is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Warlito owns & operates an agriculture business, earning income from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Warlito has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 28000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Warlito joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Warlito has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Warlito is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will again be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Warlito from ASKI.

Eight years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. She is engaged in this business together with her husband.\r\n\r\nSlowly the number of cows increased and, with the increase, her clients started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and for this reason is requesting a loan. Be an important part of the growth of Nodira\u2019s business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in Badian, Cebu.  He has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved his living conditions with the help of his loans from NWTF and through his own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in his livestock  business, Gaudencio is gradually making his family more economically stable. He now earns an average monthly income of PHP7,000. Gaudencio is borrowing PHP 12,000 to  fund his business operations. This will be his ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. His previous loan of PHP10,000, which he paid off well within its term, was just another step in his journey towards economic freedom. Gaudencio aspires to elevate his family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering people to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ziyovaddin is a loving and self-sacrificing father. Ever since he was very young Ziyovaddin has been around people raising animals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started her business nine years ago in the city of Valledupar, Cesar Department, where she learned everything related to this enterprise both technically and marketwise.\r\n\r\nWhen she moved to Barranquilla the first thing she did was conduct a presale and offer her products to stores, neighborhood hospitals, firms in the community and housewives in general thereby acquiring customers which she still has to this day because she strives to produce quality products that are fresh and of unequalled quality and are sold at good prices.  Her goal for later on is to expand her infrastructure, acquire machinery and appliances to mechanize her processes and in the long run acquire a house of her own.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, her biggest challenge is the little working capital she can count on to reach the desired growth and this is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy a rolling machine to knead the dough more efficiently and increase productivity to take advantage of the December season that contains family festivities where consumption of her products increases and Alba will be able to be more widely known and her sales potential will expand accordingly.\r\n\r\nHer present profit margin is 35% which is in accord with this type of business which from now with impulse from her market shows growth potential that will allow for increased profits as well as the her wellbeing level being supported financially with capital from her Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":939984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 23-year-old Ikupa M.. She is married and has one child, aged nine months. In 2007, Ikupa established her clothes business. She opens her business six days a week and  nine to twelve hours a day. Ikupa requires a loan in order to purchase more clothes in bulk. In the future, Ikupa plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<P>\r\nSecond-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress; however, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

A goal over the long term is to buy other overlock sewing machines to improve her sewing and as well to continue investing in cosmetics, and to be able to provide schooling to her son.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Diane Lister, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":213609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Comprar Zermat cosmetics and Romanel clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T17:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T22:04:42Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893332},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816409},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351116},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038434},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928737},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383665},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890157},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":678.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111484}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T21:04:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Lister","image":null}},{"id":73647,"name":"Lilia Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lilia Gregoria Uca\u00f1\u00e1n  D.

All but one are starting their businesses with these funds. We had the chance of talking to them all about the activities they plan to do with this loan. Only Anecia had her business set up before and will restock with this loan. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belkis A. is the group representative. She will sell hair products. She will use her loan to buy shampoo, conditioner, a special strengthening treatment called Penetrait, anti-frizz serum (which sells specially well because the Dominican Republic weather is very humid and hair frizzes fast), and hair wax for durable hair styles. Belkis knows that Dominican women are very conscious about their hair and take very special care of it. This is why she is committed to offering good quality hair products at a good price.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikaury E. and Alexandre M. will both sell clothes. Mostly pants, blouses, underwear and sandals. They will go to the flea market or to the Villa Consuelo commercial district to get their merchandise. At these two market places, they can purchase at better prices than most retail stores, which will allow them to realize larger profit margins for each sale.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoselin will sell bedding, bedspreads, curtains and sheets. She buys them by the dozen and sells them by   the piece.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Last but not least, Anecia has a fried food stand that opens at 3pm. While she was at our office in central Santo Domingo, her husband was attending the stand. ''But my customers say I do it better'' she says with a laugh. Her group mates agreed. She mostly sells fried chicken, crackling pork, fried sweet potatoes and tostones (crunchy fried plantains).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please help us support this group of entrepreneurs with this Kiva loan. Thank you!<\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":304989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She is 60 years old. Sopia is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Sopia owns & operates an \"alimango\" (mud crab) fishing business selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community. Sopia has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sopia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sopia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell and to expand the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Sopia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Unfortunately, Wilfredo says his life is not complete.  Some months ago, his girlfriend left him and took one of their daughters, whom he has not seen to this day.  He does not lose hope and is optimistic that he will get to see her soon.  Wilfredo remembers his younger daughter being disheartened, but a smile or a hug for his little Ximena makes her feel better.  He knows that he must continue to struggle on her behalf.

For instance, a high rate of unemployment makes people find and create jobs for themselves. Thus, there emerges a certain class of people who are not affected by the economic conditions in their country as they have their own households and can survive with their own cattle and land. The people in our story are such people, who have preferred to create their own happiness without the government\u2019s assistance. They would rather be independent entrepreneurs than always follow the changes in economic conditions and feel unsafe. \r\n\r\nAishahon I. is the leader of this group. She is 55 and has two children. Both of her sons are private builders. As for her husband, he and Aishahon are farmers and raise cattle. Sixteen years ago, they obtained land from the government and started farming. They started growing wheat and cotton. With great effort and tireless work, they have been able to achieve a decent income. They have been able to repair their house and marry off their son. At the moment, Aishahon needs a loan to purchase mineral fertilizers for cotton. She hopes to have a good harvest and, after selling the crops, to buy new furniture for her home. \r\n\r\n<u>Aishahon\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nIlgorbek A., 27, is married and has a son. He and his father own a pasture where they raise cattle. With their income, Ilgorbek has managed to obtain a college education, find a job and get married. Now Ilgorbek needs a loan to buy a washing machine as a present for his wife. \r\n\r\nYokutoi I., 27, is married and has two children. She used to manufacture clothes and sell them in the market. Later her husband organized a small shop within the house and now she sells foodstuffs. Yokutoi needs a loan to purchase foodstuffs to increase her turnover. \r\n\r\nHursanai A., 33, is the mother of two children. Her husband is a cattle breeder. As for Hursanai, she looks after cattle and sells milk. With the cattle breeding, Hursanai\u2019s family has built a new house. Hursanai needs a loan to purchase a cow. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).
