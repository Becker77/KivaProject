She is 58 years old and is the group leader of this eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Isabelita M.'s Group.\r\n\r\nIsabelita is married and has nine school-aged children. She owns and operates a transportation business, providing motorcycle transport to local community members. She has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Isabelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business.\r\n\r\nIsabelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will again be used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/font>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":533204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To repair a transport vehicle used in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sinili Santiago City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabelita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marilyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raymunda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amorsola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma.

She also sells beauty products to salon, beauty shops and barber shops. \r\n<p>\r\nThe way in which a direct sales business works is that a customer\u2019s order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, so these are the profits that dealers count on as their income. \r\n<p>\r\nMelita\u2019s regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every week. To help her continue operations, she is requesting a 34,000 PHP loan. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

This activity is very common in their place and many entrepreneurs do this.\r\n\r\nJocelyn wishes to expand her business by buying more piglets, vitamins, and feed for piglets, in order to forge ahead with her business and be able to help her family to get ahead. For this reason, she is, for the second time approaching KIVA lenders through ASHI, for a loan amounting to 20,000 Php to help her reach her goal.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is a hard-working woman dedicated to her home. Her dream is to care for her seven children and offer them a better quality of life, out of poverty. Jocelyn\u2019s neighbors, friends and even her group mates consider her respectful person.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to provide a better future for her family, sustain the profitability of her hog-raising business, start a savings account for her children and support them to finish their studies until they complete college to get better careers someday.\r\n\r\nWith hard work and determination, Jocelyn is focused on improving her quality of life through her business efforts and support from ASHI and Kiva lenders across the world.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":659515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Llamkasun Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cHuklla Llamkasun\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People who live there also face the cold,  difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<P>\r\nBCR \u201cHuklla Llamkasun\u201d is located in the community of A\u00f1ancusi in the district of Acoria, province of Huancavelica. The translation of the Quechua-name of the group is \u201cLet\u00b4s work as if we were one\u201d. The main activities of the population are growing tropical fruits at lower altitudes and corn, potatoes and wheat at higher altitudes. At still higher altitudes, the people are dedicated to raising bulls and cows, with alpacas and lamas at the highest altitudes. But the size of the community and its (limited) access to public transport has brought more commerce to the village; every Tuesday there is a local market where people sell and buy most of what they need.<P>\r\n\r\nThis bank has been formed recently by 17 female borrowers and therefore has no history yet\u2026. It has only just started to create history in its community! The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating from now on is for investing in their business or for the education of their children, whether it is buying school uniforms, supplies, books or even to pay the fees for entering primary or secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough many women dedicate their time to similar businesses, they require different loan amounts because of the differences in the size of the business they run \u2026. The loans range from 200 soles, 300 soles, up to 500 soles; the total of the loans of the 17 members is 5,400 soles (US$ 1925).<P>\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, Lucila R. Nolberta, sells fruit at local markets. Another business she runs is raising small cattle. As is the case in most families, besides her business, she dedicates most of her time to the cultivation of potatoes, wheat, and oca (a root vegetable), which she uses for home consumption. With her 200 soles loan she will be able to buy more fruits. When asked about her future, she tells us that her dream is the education of her children so they can be professionals and go on studying. She simply wants to make her life and that of her family better. With her (future) savings she plans to buy more chickens and pigs, to sell when they have grown big.<P>\r\n\r\nJuliana D. Mar\u00edn, who sells clothes and shoes in her small shop, tells us a slightly different story.  Like Lucila, Juliana grows potatoes, wheat, and other crops for home consumption. With her loan of 500 soles, she will be able to buy more merchandise for her business. With more merchandise, she will be able to earn a little more and therefore save more. Her dream for the future is to live a good life with her family and her children.

El Jaibalito es un pueblo muy peque\u00f1o que est\u00e1 ubicado en una cuesta muy, pero muy, empinada. Casi todas las casas est\u00e1n ubicadas en las laderas de una monta\u00f1a. Este peque\u00f1o pueblo no est\u00e1 conectado por carreteras con los otros pueblos vecinos ya que la complicada geograf\u00eda de las monta\u00f1as y volcanes no permite que una carretera sea construida.

Las mujeres hablan mayormente el Maya-Tzutujil y, como se ve en la foto, ellas visten sus bellos trajes tradicionales. La falta de exposici\u00f3n a otras culturas inhibe a la gente cuando ellas ven a un \u201cextranjero\u201d. El encuentro entre las se\u00f1oras y mi persona fue muy gracioso.

Con estos hilos, ellas van a elaborar bellos trajes tradicionales utilizando la t\u00e9cnica antigua de telar de cintura. Las mujeres en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n aprenden, de sus madres, a tejer desde que tienen nueve a\u00f1os de edad.\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres piensan que el cr\u00e9dito si les sirve porque les ayuda a comprar mayor cantidad de hilo y con este poder elaborar m\u00e1s huipiles, independientemente si sus clientes le pagan o no a tiempo. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras que cargan una bella sonrisa todos lados merecen una oportunidad de salir adelante como empresarias.

The business is located in the livestock markets at Julc\u00e1n and Otuzco. \r\nShe remembers with gratitude the first time that Manuela Ramos granted her a loan for 300 soles, with which she bought products for a small general store she had at that time. \"A lot of sweets were sold because my house was very close to a school,\" says Madeleyne.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Over the years, Kobilbobo has become very knowledgeable about what is required to raise cattle, their feeding, their calving, etc. It should be noted that, in the past, this man endured hard economic times for a while but he's managed to come through thanks to the help provided by IMON International.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Jovita from PMPC.

Her thriving business caters to the interests of local customers along the Congo border in Rwebinyonyi trading centre, Rukungiri.\r\n\r\nHope has been earning profits amounting to 150,000 Ugandan shillings on a weekly basis. Her main challenge has been, however, having a small amount of stock due to the hindrance of low capital input in her business. Her recourse has, however, been her teaching job salary and also her small fish-selling business.\r\n\r\nWith Hope\u2019s sense of determination, the sky seems to be the limit in her drive to establish a firm foothold in this retail business and also in her fledgling fish-selling business.

Ana lives with her sister, who works as a degreed computer programmer, and her three year old niece.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna has her own store where she sells various products such as candy, bread, toilet paper, medicines, and different brands of detergents.  Even though she has eight years of experience, most of her earnings go toward maintaining her household.  She invests very little in her business, which is why she needs help improving it.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan from Apoyo Integral so that she will have the money necessary to buy large quantities of products such as eggs, juices, milk, bread, and candies of different brands so that her customers will have a wider variety to choose from and want to buy more.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna is very dedicated to what she does, which is why she wants to grow her business and provide better service to her customers so that they will feel more comfortable in her store.  By making these improvements, she hopes to improve her earnings. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

younger than 15. Her motivation comes from the difficulties she faced, especially the death of her mother, poor health, her inability to continue education and the destruction of her cassava farm by wild fire. As a consequence of all this, she was unable to educate her children even at primary school level.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by GHAPE borrowers she became a member of GHAPE and received her first loan of 40,000CFAF in 2009. Since then she has proven her ability to receive, invest and repay her loan. From previous loans she provided her community with food stuff like beans, corn and Irish potatoes. \r\nShe is proud of her achievements, especially her success in owning and managing her own business. With profits from these loans, she has been paying her children\u2019s school fees. \r\n\r\nWith a new loan, she plans to continue in the same line of business. She plans to buy twenty tins of beans for 50,000FCFA, fifteen tins of Irish potatoes for 20,000FCFA, six tins of corn for 15,000FCFA and vegetables for 10,000FCFA  She will provide food stuff to the community and the business will succeed since she has many customers. Her intention is to use the profit to continue to educate her children and to take care of her health and her family. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells her products to the warehouses in the Districts of San Francisco and Quimbiri. What she likes the best about her work is the harvest because she sees the results of months of hard work by obtaining high quality coffee and cocoa grains and coca leaves. These crops bring in good income. She has been doing this work for four years and feels that the most difficult part is protecting the crops from pests.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy coffee and cocoa seeds. One of her future goals is to buy more land to increase her plantation. This is Sandy\u2019s first loan from MFP and she is committed to paying it back in a timely manner since she hopes to obtain another loan in the near future. The loan of 1.500 Nuevos Soles will be used to buy and plant seeds for her plantation.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":736425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa and coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-24T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":101.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":106.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":109.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":114.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":117.31},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":120.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":127.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":130.53},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":135.27},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":140.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":145.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":101.66,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":103.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196411},{"amount":39.71,"local_amount":108.29,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:38Z","rounded_local_amount":109.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270092},{"amount":39.56,"local_amount":107.91,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":109.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550110},{"amount":42.01,"local_amount":114.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":116.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718785},{"amount":391.44,"local_amount":1067.57,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1083.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350242}],"funded_date":"2011-03-24T15:59:05Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elsa Mejia Connelly","image":null}},{"id":288348,"name":"Zonia Aida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Zonia, tiene 56 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en la ciudad de San Miguel, se dedica a la venta de tortillas y antojitos, vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de un nieto que tiene 11 a\u00f1os de edad.\nEl negocio  de ella inicio hace 10 a\u00f1os, vendiendo tortillas y antojitos, este negocio surge por la necesidad de disponer de dinero, su horario es de 8:00am a 4:00pm, de lunes a domingo.\n\nActualmente esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de le\u00f1a y ma\u00edz, esta compra es debido al incremento del costo del ma\u00edz, por que lo ella piensa comprar para tener la disponibilidad por un periodo.\n\nSu plan es que con esta inversi\u00f3n, tenga lo necesario para producir y tener mejores ganancias, cancelando esta deuda y cubriendo las necesidades del hogar.\n\n","en":"Zonia is 56 years old and she lives in the city of San Miguel.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

sister.<p>\r\n\r\nMartha started her tailoring business two years ago after completing her tailoring course in Kisii town.\r\nBefore venturing into the tailoring business, Martha used to sell cereals in the Kisii market, a business that she did for five years.  She used the profits from her cereals business and savings from various women's groups to start her tailoring business.  She initially started with one sewing machine, but she has worked hard to expand her business and she currently has three sewing machines.<p>\r\n\r\nWith the little profits that Martha gets from her business, she is still able to provide food, clothing and shelter for her children.  But most importantly, she says she is glad that she can pay for all her children's school fees.

She buys them wholesale and retails them. This is a business that is working very well for her, except for the fact that she often runs short of this product or that. She is therefore requesting this first loan to add to her inventory.<P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b> N\u00e9e en 1968 \u00e0 Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 madame G. est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants.

Amina thanks you for her support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":215450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T13:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T15:02:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970675},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886892},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436152},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130425},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027227},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613263},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010346},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232657},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:50:46Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664473},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50221.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105218}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T15:02:59Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":74459,"name":"Saret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Saret H., 22, and her husband, Mr. Ret Touch, 23, live in a small village off the national road two, about 20 kilometers south of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

above 15 years of age. Patrick and his entire family are living in a house with three bedrooms and one sitting room. As a very hard working man, Patrick has faced many challenges in life. In the process of struggling to earn a living, he encountered many challenges in life such as the death of his pigs and people owing him huge sums of money for work done. These problems made life very difficult for him until 2005 when he became a member of GHAPE and received his first loan (for 20,000 FRS). He received a loan of 65,000 FRS in 2006 and 400,000 FRS in 2007. He successfully repaid these loans. \r\n\r\nNow Patrick is requesting a loan so he can buy \u201cwilberoo\" fish and five piglets and make repairs on his pig pen. Repayment of the loan will start at the fourth month from the day of disbursement. Patrick is convinced that the business will succeed because of the experience he has had in it and he is well known in the community as fish supplier.\r\n\r\nPatrick plans to use the profit from the loan to construct a good house for his family, pay for his children's school fees, and to feed and cloth his family. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training GHAPE provides before giving out loans and the follow up it does after the loan is disbursed to ensure  proper usage of the loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Also, Maria has various orders to fill and with the profits from this business she buys the food for that day's meals.  Now her husband is sowing oats in order to feed their animals so that they continue to produce their delicious milk.  Maria is the founder of her community bank, for which she has much affection and esteem and during this time she has occupied many different posts which she has fulfilled with a great deal of responsibility: she's also repaid every one of her installments punctually.  The money which she is asking for is to prepare and plough her lands in order to be able to increase production and have provisions for August, which is a time of drought in their area.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":306899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Prepare her lands for sowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T17:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2005.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123966}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T19:09:47Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":107227,"name":"Takku Liggey Cite Senghor 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"HAWA ,DIARA ET MARIAMA SONT TROIS FEMMES MARIEES QUI VIVENT A THIES AU QUARTIER CITE SENGHOR .ELLES FONT DU COMMERCE DE PRODUITS DIVERS DEPUIS PLUSIEURS.ELLES SE SONT REGROUPEES EN GROUPE ET ONT OUVERT UN COMPTE A LA MUTUELLE .AVEC CE PRET ELLES VEULENT RENFORCER LEURS ACTIVITES GENERATRICES DE REVENUS.","en":"Hawa, Diara, and Mariama are three married women who live in Thies, in the Senghor district.

She is a working mother and responsible.  She lives in her own house with her husband and children.  She has 9 children, 4 of which live elsewhere and 5 with her.  They are the reason behind her efforts.  She works buying, raising and selling pigs.  She gets up very early to feed them and fatten them for market.  She cares for them with affection since she knows that she will have money for family expenses thanks to them.  Her husband is a farmer and she helps him in the afternoon hours when the pigs are grazing.  Her eight years in this business have given her the necessary experience to do a good job.  What she likes best about it is that she can do her household chores at the same time she is caring for her animals.

She and her husband have three children (ages 6, 4, and 1).  They live in the district of Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz, which is located 5 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nShe makes and sells yogurt, a trade she learned while attending an institute in Chiclayo.  She has been in business for 4 years and sells her products daily at the outdoor Moshoqueque Market from 6:30am to 12pm.  In the afternoons, she buys the ingredients she needs to prepare the next batch of yogurt that she will sell the following day.  She also distributes her product to different stores in the area and at specialty fairs where she is invited.\r\n<p>\r\n Her husband bought a moto-taxi (a motorcycle with a sidecar for transporting cargo or passengers) to help her distribute her merchandise.  He also uses it to provide transportation services.  Excessive use of the vehicle has resulted in engine failure, so Gladis is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 800 soles.  She will use the money to make repairs to the vehicle as well as buy more ingredients so that she can expand her yogurt business.\r\n<p>\r\nGladis dreams of building a house because her family currently lives in a rented home.  She also dreams of continued success in her business so that she can open her own location where she can produce and sell yogurt.  She is well known among her customers and they appreciate the care she puts into making a quality product.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives in her own house with her five children; Yony is 18, Hern\u00e1n is 15, Vilma is 13, Norma is 9, and Roger is 6.  She wants to give them a good post high school education.\r\n\r\nNicolasa\u2019s business is located at the La Rinconada mine, which is at more the 5,400 meters above sea level.  Her main activity is selling sweets.  However, she also does other activities like selling tricycles on Sundays at the fair.  Some nights she offers transportation services in her \u201cmotocarro\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle).  She only does this sporadically because of the intense cold in this mining area.\r\n\r\nWhat Nicolasa likes best about her activities is being able to give her children all of the amenities that they need.  She has been doing this work for three years.  The most difficult part is having to withstand the intense cold in the mine.  Later, she hopes to have a grocery store where she could sell more peacefully.\r\n\r\nThis is Nicolasa\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  She expects to make all of her payments on time so she does not hurt the members of her communal bank.  She is very respected in her communal bank for the responsibility that she shows.  She will use the 3,000 PEN she is requesting to buy more sweets to better stock her sales stand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":470922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-16T20:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124451},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960192},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993036},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717822},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751498},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933963}],"funded_date":"2010-01-16T23:24:35Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":173110,"name":"Akbar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akbar T. is a 25 year old, young, single man.

She sells from their home while her husband sells from different grocery stores.

She lives with her husband and their children in Sanoubougou I-Kapel Kourou, an outlying district of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After having run many business unsuccessfully, Kadidia became familiar with buying and selling cooking oil, Arab couscous, Maggie bouillon cubes, and many other types of goods. She has been in this business for over six years and runs it out of her house and at the market in her district, where she has a spot at her disposal. She is in high demand by her customers for the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, Kadidia decided to join again the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over two years ago. She is currently on her fourth loan.

He previously worked at a cotton-ball processing facility, but his profit there was low.  He decided to close that business and get involved in fattening up livestock.  He has two cows at that time.  Each cow produced up to 20 liters of milk daily, and neighbors bought dairy products from Uktam, and his grandsons had only dairy products for breakfast.  Uktam was offered a large amount of money for his cows, but he did not want to sell because this was his main source of income.  Having learned about our organization in 2007, Uktam obtained a loan from us and purchased one more bull.  Soon after, he started to breed and sell livestock.  Throughout the four-year partnership, he leased a plot of land outside the town and purchased two more cows and two more bulls.  He spent the entire summer on that land and planted radish and carrots there, using the money from each sold livestock.  And now, he sells his harvest.  Livestock is cheaper during winter than during warm seasons, and this is why Uktam plans to use this loan to purchase four more cows.  Currently, he and his family are grateful to the creditors for the financial support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":935094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Uktam","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":651.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":682.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":651.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":682.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":651.2,"local_amount":651.2,"processed_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":651.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212422},{"amount":666.11,"local_amount":666.11,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":666.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443175},{"amount":682.69,"local_amount":682.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":682.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323048157}],"funded_date":"2012-01-11T10:35:19Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:19:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":370353,"name":"Corazon De Jesus Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yuuliana vive en el distrito de los Olivos, tiene una familia grande sus 4 hijos aun est\u00e1n en edad escolar, junto a su esposo luchan para sacar adelante a su familia, es as\u00ed que  ahorrando algo de dinero  han podido comprar un carro que alquilan para realizar servicio de taxi, el ingreso que le genera el alquiler de su carro es de mucha ayuda  as\u00ed puede brindarle a su hijos una buena educaci\u00f3n y comprar algunos art\u00edculos para su hogar, el pr\u00e9stamo que le otorga EDAPROSPO le ser\u00e1 de mucha ayuda para la reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento del carro, de esa manera podr\u00e1 seguir alquil\u00e1ndolo, Yuuliana es la tesorera del grupo \u201cCORAZON DE JESUS\u201d ya tiene cerca de 2 a\u00f1os integrando el ALCOM, ella quiere seguir ahorrando para lograr comprarse otro veh\u00edculo.\n\n*Yuuliana viste polo fuccia.\n","en":"Yuuliana lives in the District of Los Olivos.

Due to recent construction at Dantokpa, Lucie has had to relocate to a less lucrative location.

He tells us that he had the opportunity to work in this field thanks to a small fishing boat that he and his six brothers inherited from their father.  Today they all count on this boat to earn their living.\r\n\r\nThey all go to sea when the weather is favorable, and they stay there for several days.  The fish that they are able to catch are sold from the dock where they land to the merchants who later sell the fish in a market at that district's terminal.\r\n\r\nIsidro and his brothers have been saving some of their earnings to put toward the maintenance of their instrument of work.  He hopes to make some improvements to the infrastructure of the boat in order to optimize its functionality.  To do so, he has seen the necessity to request a loan of 1000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa, which would help him to achieve his goal.\r\n\r\nIsidro is a responsible person who is very knowledgable about his profession.  He greatest longing is to be able to equip his boat with instruments that optimize he and his brothers' labor, including items like the radio transmitter he holds in the photo, which he just purchased.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":508744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Gastos de mantenimiento de infraestructura de bolichera.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa -

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Caleb V., who is 48 years old, helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 19. \r\n\r\nRisalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Risalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her son's education. \r\n\r\nRisalie V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He moved to Dakar in 1999, with the goal of finding a job, earning a living, and helping his family. Thus, through a friend, he became an employee of a security agency named Raam Daan, which ensures the security of the holdings of U-IMCEC (one of Kiva's field partners) in Dakar. He is about forty years old and lives in Grand Yoff, a suburb of Dakar. He is married and is the father of one child, aged 5. His monthly salary is insufficient and does not allow him to resolve some social needs or to start up certain projects. It is for this reason that he is seeking a loan of 200,000 frs. The aim of this loan is to buy cement to make bricks that will allow him to construct a 3-room building to improve the living conditions of his mother and his small family, since they live in straw huts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nBenita is married and has two adult children. She owns and operates a business selling bananas and vegetables. She has been engaged in her business for over twenty-six years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a week.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Benita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more products to sell. This loan will be her fourth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/font>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":470091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

The competition that exists among their businesses is not as difficult since each member's business is well segmented and has its own distribution channels for selling and offering products.  Their businesses are situated in strategic locations.  The members who sell cosmetics have steadily built up their clientele and have been working for many years with their products.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be designated for investment in their various works.  Some members are starting new businesses.  Others are changing out their inventory based on the season and the market conditions of supply and demand.  Most of the members only heard about the availability of these loans through their group, so they are taking a training course in which they are instructed in how credit works and the expectations the Institution has for each of its members.  Some members are very knowledgeable already since this is an experienced group that has worked previously with another institution.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She earns her living by operating a fish vending business.  Her husband Ramon, who is 46 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between the ages of 9 and 23 years old.  \r\n\r\nHelen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 30,000 PHP, thus increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for the fish vending business so that she could continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and the education of her children. Helen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Each one of them has a job to get their family ahead and to make each day of their lives better. They live in an area of sugarcane production and the majority of their husbands make a living chopping cane during harvest (when the sugar mills are in a production period.)\r\n\r\nAlejandra is one of the members of the group. She is 37 years old and studied until middle school. She is married to Dionicio and has two children that attend school in her community.   \r\n\r\nAlejandra says that more than 15 years ago she began selling a little of everything to help her husband with household expenses, but several years ago she began selling hamburgers and hot dogs on weekends in the park of a nearby community. She says that thanks to God she sells quite a few and with the passing of time has made many customers who like her food a lot. What helps her the most is that the church is at the front of the park, and after mass people like to spend money. \r\n\r\nShe has been very happy because her business is getting bigger and this will help her be able to give her family the best quality of life. \r\n\r\nShe will put this loan towards the purchase of meat, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, onions, bread and drinks. \r\n\r\nShe told us that in the future she would like to invest in a few tables and chairs to give the best service to her customers. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\nFlorina Manualidades\r\nAlejandra: Hot dog and hamburger sales\r\nOdali: Cosmetic sales\r\nSilvia: Mexican antiques sales\r\nConcepcion: Cosmetic sales\r\nFlorencia: Catalogue sales\r\nAnabel: Catalogue sales\r\nDaniel: Mechanic workshop\r\n\r\nNote: Daniel isn't in the photo but his wife is. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":984527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, onions, bread and drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-22T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Odali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":487.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330303},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044321},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656513},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T17:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317190},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418654},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":6500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6539.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294568326}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T18:09:33Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:43:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kaleigh Oleynik","image":900818}},{"id":481241,"name":"Adriel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Adriel, de 64 a\u00f1os, es un hombre muy alegre y responsable, el es conviviente con su pareja con quien tiene siete hijos mayores, vive en la casa heredada de sus padres junto a sus hermanos, sus hijos como ya son adultos tienen independencia, por ese motivo el vive \u00fanicamente con su pareja en la casa donde cr\u00edo a todos sus hijos.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Aida knew that his employment and income opportunities would be limited because of his limited education.  By providing him with a business to run for himself, she knew that he would be able to earn income everyday.  Ma. Aida is less worried about her daughter since she has a husband to support her.\r\n\r\nMa. Aida\u2019s first loan in ASHI was used as a down payment (initial payment) for the motorcycle she bought for her son to use for a taxi hire business (which is commonly called \u201chabal-habal\u201d in the province dialect).  Everyday, Ma. Aida\u2019s son can earn a minimum of Php100 profit, which he gave to Ma. Aida to pay for monthly amortization on the motorcycle.  Ma.

Julia has 2 school-aged children and recently her husband lost his job, and for this reason she saw the necessity of working.

Now her husband found work, but Julia wants to keep working to help her sons forge ahead with their education so they can have a better future.  For this reason she needs capital to buy products to offer, and to bring appealing products directly to her customers.  \r\n\r\nThe rest of her fellow bank members sell hamburgers, bread, meals, and cosmetics.  The competition amongst the members is very difficult, especially in the areas of  food sales and cosmetics, as each member hopes each day to have a good result with their sales.  This loan will be used to restock their businesses with more products, so that they can offer better service to their customers and so that their businesses will provide higher incomes in the future and a better economic situation.  As this is a new group, they have been given training, and they are very pleased and content to be clients of Agrocapital.

It\u2019s part of the Valle parish, which has a cold climate.  Farming and raising livestock are its people\u2019s traditional occupations.  Most of the population goes out in the mornings, to work in the city of Cuenca, to work various trades, and returns in the evening.  Our associates work different trades, but with the same goal; to get their families ahead and offer them a better future.\r\n\r\nCarmen Isabel C. lives in the Conchan del Milagro community, which is a part of the Valle parish.  This will be her third loan through the foundation.  The prior ones have helped her small business.  She is a seamstress who learned this trade five years ago when one of her friends taught her.  She now works out of a small workshop in her home, alongside her husband who also works in this trade.  They do all sorts of sewing and repairs.  They don\u2019t have a regular schedule, but they work Monday through Saturday.  Sunday is a family day.  Carmen is very young, barely 23.  She is married and has two children, one is two years old and the other is four months old.  They don\u2019t have a house of their own yet, so they live in a house that her mother loaned them.  She will use the money from this loan to invest in a new sewing machine that they need.  Her goal is to complete her collage education, now that she has completed five [out of six] years of study.\r\n\r\nRosa Aurora Q. lives in the Maluay de Curiquinga community, which is a part of the Valle parish.  She is 49 years old, is married and has 10 children.  Her three oldest are married and on their own.  Her single children are 27, 17, 15, 13, 11, 10, and 5.  Her 27 year old daughter and her 13 year old son work in the home and help with the chores.  Her 17 and 15 year old sons work and help with the household finances.  Her three youngest attend the local school.  Her husband stays home, now that he is of old age.  They were able to have their house built by working together.\r\n\r\nRosa works the trade that her parents gave her; farming.  She works her own land, where she grows corn, potatoes, etc.  Some of her harvest is for her own consumption and some she sells.
