Since Anarkan had never worked before, she faced the challenge of finding a job to make a living.

She lives with two of her four children, Jarol and Julissa, who she takes care of in her own house, located in the Chilca district.  Her smile shows her vitality. \r\n\r\nShe grows products such as potatoes, olluco (root vegetable similar to potato) and lima beans, once a year.  As she wishes to have quality products, she is constantly looking after them, fertilizing and protecting them  She is thankful for farming, as it allowed her to support her children, and provide their daily food. But as these earnings are not steady, she decided to get into sewing, and she makes articles of clothing of every size and quality. \r\n\r\nShe says she earns an average of 150 nuevos soles per week, but at Christmas, New Year's, and the Santiago agricultural festival, she gets better earnings. That is why she now wishes to improve her quality of life by repairing her house, since her children are all professionals and need their space. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she is hoping for your contribution, so that she can make her plans a reality. Moreover, she promises to fulfil her instalment payments.

","en":"Kulbara is 53 years old, married, and has raised two children.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, she searched for a source of income to provide for her family and started her own animal husbandry and farming business with an initial capital of  26,000 som (KGS). Today, her cow and sheep business, which allows her to sell meat and dairy products, brings about 10,000  som (KGS) per month.  Kulbara also cultivates 1.10 hectares of land where she grows potatoes and wheat. In order to further develop her business, Kulbara has requested a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) from \"Bai Tushum and Partners\".  This loan will help her purchase four calves for fattening.  Kulbara plans to invest her income in the construction of a new  barn, in order to provide comfortable living conditions for her

He liked the idea and with the money they had saved they bought 4 washing machines in cash and started the business. Currently they have 6 washing machines and 2 tricycles with which they move them from house to house. They work from 7 am to 9 pm every day of the week.<p>\r\nPedro wants the loan in order to buy himself 2 more washing machines. He has lots of demand that he is currently unable to meet.<p>\r\nPedro is 32 years old. He is married with 3 children, 2 of whom are currently in school. His wife works selling shellfish in the morning and in the afternoon she helps with the washing machine business. About six months ago they bought a small house, since they were living with Pedro's mother. In the future they hope to begin to fix it up in order to give their family a better life. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcora, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p><p>\r\nPedro tiene una experiencia de 6 a\u00f1os en el negocio de alquiler de lavadoras. Antes se dedicaba desde la edad de 12 a\u00f1os a la pesca junto a su padre, luego ya mayor comienza por su cuenta a vender pescado. Decide dejar ese oficio y comienza a vender tarjetas de celulares en las calles pero el municipio de la ciudad no lo dejaba trabajar, hasta que un cierto d\u00eda su esposa le anima para comprarse unas lavadoras y comenzar a alquilarlas. Le gusto la idea y con un dinero que ten\u00edan ahorrado compran al contado 4 lavadoras y comienzan el negocio. Actualmente cuentan con 6 lavadoras y 2 triciclos que son donde las movilizan de un domicilio a otro en horario de 7 a.m. hasta las  9 p.m. todos los d\u00edas de la semana. <p>\r\nPedro desea el cr\u00e9dito para poder comprarse unas dos lavadoras mas ya que tiene una demanda muy buena y por el momento no se abastece con las que tiene. <p>\r\nPedro tiene 32 a\u00f1os, es casado y 3 hijos dos de los cuales ya estudian. Su esposa tambi\u00e9n trabaja vendiendo mariscos en la ma\u00f1ana y en la tarde le ayuda a el en el negocio. Hace unos seis meses atr\u00e1s el se compro una casita ya que viv\u00eda con su mama, y a futuro espera  comenzar  arreglarla para darle mejor vida a su familia.\r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

This 39-year-old Agnes M. from Mwanza. She is married with four children between the ages of seven and 17. Agnes has been running a clothes business since 1999. She sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method and has its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is an expressive textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. In addition, Agnes runs a tailoring business where she can sew those fabrics purchased in her store to the specifications of her customers. She works at this business for six hours per day, 12 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Agnes currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in  order to purchase another sewing machine. Agnes thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T00:20:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970768},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886985},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436245},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130517},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027314},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613332},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010415},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232726},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664542},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105273}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T03:53:53Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":78227,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen A. is a tailor.

Her two children (Abigail, 31 years old, and Lea, 28 years old) now have their own families. Yolanda is now a grandmother who wants only for her grandchildren to finish their studies, unlike their mothers. That is why she does everything just to improve her business that has been her partner for many years.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda's business is the selling of different kinds of plastic and Styrofoam. She has run this business for 10 years now, and she continues to run it with the help of added capital from a loan that she received in Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) after joining that organization in 2000. Because she used the loan properly, she has already expanded the store into a much bigger one than before. Now she wants another loan to buy the things she needs in her business so that it will grow more.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda's dream is not for herself anymore, but for her grandchildren--for them to finish their studies so they can have a better life in the future. She plans to make her business continue to grow so that she will help her grandchildren with their educational

She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her shop. In the future, Krishna Maiya plans to improve the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a <i>pasal<\/i>, is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical <i>pasal<\/i> might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Ruslana provides hair cutting services and is also a colorist in her hometown, Nikopol.  She works in a small rented space in the local bathhouse, having turned it into a cozy barber shop.  In this neighborhood there are no other barber shops, which helps the growth of Ruslana's business.  In addition to the lack of competitors the growth of the business has been effected by the help of her husband and Ruslana's own striving for growth.  In the beginning Ruslana worked in sales but then understood that this was not the right sphere for her and decided to start a barber shop.  She has been in this business for only 2 years so far.  Her monthly net profit is around 2,300 hryvnia.\r\n\r\nRuslana plans to invest the KIVA loan of 8,000 hryvnia into paying rent on the space that she leases for work.  Under the terms of her lease she needs to prepay the rent for half a year in advance.  In addition, Ruslana hopes to purchase necessary equipment to work in her beauty salon and to purchase a glass display.  Ruslana has plans to transform her small barber shop into a real beauty salon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":900475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

Once this process is finished, her husband borrows a car in order to transport the merchandise to the city, and Victoria takes advantage of this opportunity to bring her textiles and sell them in the market. Thanks to her skill in her trade, she can make enough money for her personal needs. Even when she takes her animals out to graze, she's knitting.

He was born into a farm family. He is a married man and has one son, Minggas S., who is 9 years old and studying in the first grade of elementary school. Frans lives with his family in Nenas Village, Fatumnasi Sub district, Kapan \u2013 South Central Region of Timor. Nenas lives far away from downtown. It takes about two and a half hours to travel from the Kapan Branch Office. Even though categorized as a cloistered place, Nenas Village is surrounded with a beautiful view. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet his family's needs, Frans has to work hard by cultivating carrots, leeks and vegetables. The traders from Kupang city usually come to buy his agricultural products, so he doesn\u2019t have to sell them at the market. The income that he generates from selling agricultural products helps him to meet his family's needs and Minggas\u2019 educational needs, such as his uniform and books. \r\n\r\nFrans usually works on the farm from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. Frans faces challenges in farming. He has to fetch water from a well by using two buckets and then carrying them on his shoulders. Actually, there is a fresh water facility available in the village. It is provided by a Non-Government Institution in West Timor, but not all of the community members, including Frans, can access the fresh water facility because their houses are situated far from the main street. This is the reason why he has to fetch water from the well. Even though he has to walk for about four kilometers from his farm to fetch the water, Frans never complains. He is happy to do his work.\r\n\r\nFrans and family live in a very simple house that is constructed of thatch (also called water reeds or roof reeds), It is called a \u2018round house\u2019 \u2013 this is a type of traditional house in the South Central Region of Timor). There is only one room available in this house for cooking and sleeping. Frans plans to build a better house for his family, but he cannot afford it as he is only a poor farmer. His income is only enough to meet their daily needs and his son\u2019s educational needs. \r\n\r\nFrans heard from the clergyman in the village that the Kiva field partner, the Tanaoba Lais Manekat Foundation, provides cattle loans for farmers in West Timor through the Cattle Fattening Program. Many farmers have felt the benefits of this program. Frans discussed it with his neighbors and they decided to form a group of ten farmers to join the Cattle Fattening Program. The group was named Nasaret A1. He is interested in joining the program because he wants to build a house for his family. He believes that through this program he will be able to generate profits that can help him buy the necessary building materials. Frans is requesting a loan amounting to 3,400,000 IDR from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten in twelve months. The other group members are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle. They hope to have a better life through this loan.\r\n\r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Jermias was not present."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":433892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Nenas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T18:40:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yulius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marteda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Markus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melkior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jermias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Apris","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfonsus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":33500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1769.7,"local_amount":16700000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16705982.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195922614},{"amount":1780.3,"local_amount":16800000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:04:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16806017.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211305063}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T15:24:31Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:04:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":160404,"name":"Barbara Hilda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia HILDA tiene 42 a\u00f1os, es conviviente y tiene dos hijas.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Unidad (The Unity), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in Hato Mayor, a poor, rural area where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home there in a simple structure as a single mother with her two children.\r\n\r\nDominga is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business.

Their eventual sale will yield additional profits that will used to support his family.  <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes its role as a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Martin is the facilitator of the Mwenda Pole group. This  group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program.\n\nMartin takes care of three children at home. He joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for his family. In the recent 2011 season, Martin had an excellent maize yield, harvesting 12 bags on 1\/2 acre of land.

\n","en":"Kochkonbek is 54 years old, married and has two children.  Kochkonbek spent all his life working in the agricultural field, first starting as a driver at a collective farm and then as a handyman.  In search of an additional source of income for his family, he organized his own farm in 1996 with a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and started to breed livestock and farm land.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Mrs. Phan S. is the village bank president, who has been selected by the members. She is a vegetable seller. Since her business is going well, she wants to expand it so she decided to ask for a loan to buy different kinds of vegetables to re-sell to her customers. She hopes to increase her income and improve her living conditions with this new loan. Mrs. Phan S. is a 27-year-old widow with two children; one of whom is attending the local school, while the youngest one is too young to work or study because that child is two years old. <p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. These allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

She lives there with her husband, her son and her niece.  For the past five years she has worked raising small animals.  She started this business when she lost most of her money from her business selling chicken meat.  Although circumstances prevented her from continuing to do that job, she found a way to earn a living without having to leave her home.  Raising animals is a good opportunity and thanks to the large demand in sales of these animals she was able to add a small henhouse in her yard.  She raises and feeds the animals and later sells them to vendors and merchants who give her orders every month.  In the future Elizabeth would like to have a store, in order to have more than one source of income and increase her earnings.  This would allow her to improve her home and the quality of life for her family.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has a great desire to progress; they live in a neighborhood in the northern part of the city.  Since she was young, she has been a hard-working woman and now she works even harder to help her children.  This is why she decided to put up a general store in her home to sell products and food while being able to take care of her home.  Over time, she has been able to add essential products and cosmetics to her store and has been able to earn the income that she needs to cover her children's educational expenses.  Her children also help her run the store.  As she is an enterprising woman, she plans to expand her store and offer a greater variety of goods to her customers.  This is her second loan from MFP and she promises to pay it back punctually; she would like to continue working hard to progress.  She is very grateful to all the people who make this loan possible that will allow her to encourage other hard-working women like herself.

","en":"Ananias is 49 years old.  He lives in his own home with his son Samuel (15).  They live in a town in the central Peruvian jungle.\r\n\r\nAnanias has been growing coffee and bananas on his own land for 20 years.  He has cared for his land for a long time and, as a result, his crops now sell for a good price.  He says that his last harvest was corn and he made good profits from his sales.   What upsets Ananias is the constant lowering of prices for his products in the market.    However, in spite of these difficulties, he would like to grow his crops in larger quantities.  In the future, he plans to commit himself to buying and selling coffee wholesale as he says that he already has buyers in the city of Pichanaki and he hopes to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nAnanias belongs to the \"Las Palmas\" community bank and this is his first loan with MFP.  As a new member, he hopes to work hard to achieve the common goals of the group.  Clearing the weeds from his farmland is very important to Ananias and, for this reason, he plans to use his loan money to invest in buying tools, as well as several sacks of manure.  In this way he hopes to improve his production and his profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":686828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy tools and manure for his plantations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-07T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ananias ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":0.14,"local_amount":0.34,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":0.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349973},{"amount":199.86,"local_amount":499.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:02Z","rounded_local_amount":560.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851418}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T05:13:56Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":267592,"name":"Rubina Sadar Ali's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rubina lives in Arifwala, a city in Pakistan famous for its agricultural business.

Since her father died, she\u2019s had to work to help with household expenses.  Therefore, she rises daily very early in the morning to care for her corn and potato crops.  Although she\u2019s formed her family she continues with this work above all because she likes it very much. But, aware that she must face new goals and responsibilities she started to work making firewood.  \u201cEverything depends on the size of the tree,\u201d she affirms.  Because her work consists primarily in cutting most of the wood, a large tree results in about 2000 pieces of firewood on average but if the trees are small, only 800 units.  She sells each bundle of 1000 units for about 200 soles on average.  This helps her meet some of her expenses.  But her overriding goal is to save enough money to buy her own house.\n\nShe belongs to the \u201cSanta Rosa\u201d communal bank and this is the first MFP loan where she hopes for your cooperation to make her plans a reality.

Her younger brother lives with her and together they have come up with a good plan to increase their income. Their plan is to purchase a motorcycle which her brother will operate as a a bodaboda (for hire). Transport is very needed in Kampala and bodaboda drivers can do quite well.<\/p><p>The money earned from this business will help the family but Joyce also realizes that as a young man, her brother also needs to have some money of his own.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

A., 40, is the owner of \u201cDespensa Gonza\u201d. Despensas are like mini supermarkets and are very popular in Paraguay. Every despensa is well-known in the neighborhood where it is located. Despensas are often very successful businesses in Paraguay because it is tradition to shop there.  The owner knows the customers very well and they usually have a friendly relationship. Generally, the owner will know all of the gossip in the neighborhood and that attracts customers who not only go there to shop but also to hear what is going on in the area. For these reasons, many people prefer despensas to supermarkets.<p>\r\n With this in mind, Gonzalina decided to open a despensa in her house.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ever since her partner left her, she had the bravery to move forward alone working as a seamstress, a trade she has made for more than 20 years. In the beginning, she worked at home receiving some orders from her neighbors to fix their garments; later, the municipality opened a market in the district where she lived and she knew to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire a place, where she has been working for 10 years.

This city of Kisangani, located north of the equator, is in Orientale province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it\u2019s on the border with Sudan and Uganda to the northeast.

Since 2000, he has gained a fair amount of small business experience.  Selling fuel was his first business with $20 in initial capital.  Over the years, he changed businesses and has managed to establish a loyal customer base for advancing his business.  \r\n\r\nHis ambitions are, first of all, to take business trips in the future with the aim of supplying the people of the city with sought-after goods.  Secondly, it\u2019s to build a house for his family.  He obtained five loans from the micro-finance institution HOPE RDC, and he repaid them appropriately.  Right now, his business generates a profit of $40 a week.  Given the ever-increasing demand, the loan he\u2019ll receive next will allow him to bolster his inventory of merchandise by purchasing food items of the same type. \r\n\r\nN\u2019sila is 36 years old, married, and the father of two girls and two boys, ages 8 to 16.

He breeds calves and cows. He is married and has two children whom he needs to support and give a proper education to. Boikuzi has improved his financial situation because he has been able to use the loans he has received from IMON International wisely to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to offer animal derivates (as dairy products) in the areas surrounding his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

With the new loan she is requesting, she will buy chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, feed pellets, corn, and some products to stock her store, such as rice, sugar and cooking oil. \r\n\r\nHer great dream is to construct a shed so she can expand her chicken farm. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":497490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, feed pellets and corn; and rice, sugar, oil and noodles to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T14:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Evangelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:24Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946486},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946487},{"amount":78.75,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674750},{"amount":146.25,"local_amount":143,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":146.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708914},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892209},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632617}],"funded_date":"2010-03-01T16:20:42Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":185661,"name":"Sammy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sammy is a 60-year-old married man living near the town of Kitale, in western Kenya.

A city with many factories, enterprises and companies has a lot to offer for its residents regarding jobs and career opportunities.\r\n\r\nTash Komur city used to be a prospering coal mining city with a predominantly Russian population. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the mining process stopped and the whole process of development of the city\u2019s infrastructure deteriorated. Now, this city is one of those cities that are regarded as dead cities, due to its high level of migration and unemployment.\r\n\r\nOur heroes are today\u2019s residents of this city and Mairamkul T. is the leader of this group. She is a widow and has raised her children, facing all the difficulties herself. Now she is forty-two and, to provide for her family, she is occupied with cattle breeding. About fifteen years ago, she bought a cow and three goats and started raising cattle. Apart from that, she is also engaged in farming, growing certain kinds of vegetables.\r\n\r\nMairamkul is the mother of four children. Her eldest son is a tractor driver and the rest of her children are daughters who help her look after the cattle and the garden.\r\n\r\nMairamkul has applied for this loan as she wants to buy one more cow so as to have more milk for sale. She plans to send her eldest daughter to Jalalabad city to a medical school.\r\n\r\nMairamkul\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nAigerim T., 19, is married and has a daughter. She trades in watermelons and vegetables, as her mother-in-law offered to look after her child. Sometimes she and her husband sell vegetables by driving around the city in their car. Aigerim needs a loan to repair their kitchen.\r\n\r\nMeriza S., 19, is single and lives with her grandmother. To provide for herself and her grandmother, she grows vegetables, breeds cattle, and works as a waitress in a caf\u00e9. She needs this loan to buy two calves.\r\n\r\nKubataaly K., 65, is retired. He grows corn, tomatoes and onions and, besides this, he keeps cattle. By having two occupations, he has been able to build a two-story house. He needs a loan to build a winter kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Campclark, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store.  Ana Maria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ana Maria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to support her family and save for future home repairs. Ana Maria A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.
