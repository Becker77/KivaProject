Through their diligence in managing their resources, Lourdes and Apolonio have been able to provide a complete education for their children who were willing to pursue their college studies. At the moment, they are still sending two of their children to school. \r\n<p>\r\nLourdes is engaged in the livestock business.  She has been taking good care of ten goats which has been a big help in responding to their financial needs especially in times of emergencies. Grown up goats are being sold at least once a week. For each goat, she gets PHP 2,500 and this is quite helpful for the family\u2019s needs. Lourdes is requesting a loan of PHP 6,000 to purchase more baby goats to raise. She is planning to use some of the loan to sustain their farm.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Julie Ann is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand the product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Julie Ann from ASKI.

She feels very thankful to God because as the female head of the family, she endured great challenges in providing their education and was always struggling to give them the best. \r\n \r\nInitially, Adis worked in the state\u2019s public sector; then she began selling second-hand clothing. In 2004, thanks to the training offered to her by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she received her fourth loan and continues to grow as a business woman. At the present time, she has diversified her supply of merchandise.  She buys her clothing in Medelin because it is very highly desired by her customers and sells it in Cartagena.  In addition, she travels to San Jacinto Bol\u00edvar, where she buys hammocks and other crafts which she sells in cities where customers have placed orders.  With her Kiva loan, she will buy casual clothing for ladies, gentlemen, and children for her customers who have ordered it to dress up for New Year\u2019s Eve parties.\r\n\r\nAs Adis is always thinking about income, she works hard.  She also sells lottery tickets.   All of these activities together, have allowed her to improve her standard of living. Now her dream is focused on owning a boutique because her primary goal as female head of the family is to provide her children with a quality education. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":609230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy ladies', gentlemen's and children's casual clothing to fill orders.

It's with this attitude that in the future she is thinking about fixing up her house to put in a store that sells spare parts for scooters.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kimberly Baker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":213644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of wood, nails and glue.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juanjui - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-7.183333 -76.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T13:55:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T18:14:39Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":508.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330933},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":508.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951303},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":508.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224330},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-19T08:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":508.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417062},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":508.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110737},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":508.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006137}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T18:14:39Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kimberly Baker","image":79832}},{"id":70603,"name":"Coumba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"COUMBA L.

He is married and the father of three children, one of whom attends school. He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming. Tired of this practice, they are requesting a loan of 100 000 FCFA (USD 200) to farm about one hectare of the aforementioned land. <p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To farm one hectare of corn and peppers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T19:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821543},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357809},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046859},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938477},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396143},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904020},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126028}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T23:35:48Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Veronique Fourment","image":442735}},{"id":82891,"name":"Olawuni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olawuni is 35 years old and married with two children.

Los 15 a\u00f1os de experiencia en este negocio le permiten desenvolverse adecuadamente en el comercio, adem\u00e1s tiene gran cantidad de clientes que le hacen pedidos mensualmente. Todos los d\u00edas se dedica a visitar a sus clientes regulares y por las tardes va en busca de otras personas para ofrecerles sus productos con la finalidad de que sus pedidos aumenten. Actualmente, Luisa ha puesto en marcha un nuevo proyecto, que es de instalar una tienda en su casa, local que est\u00e1 en construcci\u00f3n, pero pronto funcionar\u00e1 como una tienda de productos de belleza. Es por este proyecto que Luisa se est\u00e1 esforzando al m\u00e1ximo en sus horas de trabajo, realizando grandes recorridos por las calles de su localidad en busca de clientela. En los 14 pr\u00e9stamos que viene teniendo con Microfinanzas PRISMA ha trabajado con su banco comunal de manera muy responsable, gracias al empe\u00f1o que ponen cada una de sus compa\u00f1eras. Con los 2000 soles que ahora solicita comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de productos de belleza, en especial los m\u00e1s solicitados por sus clientes.","en":"Luisa is 35 years old, is married and is the mother of one son. Together with her husband and with much effort she has been able to solidify the realization of owning her very own home. From the time she was single she worked in cosmetic sales, since she was supporting her family with the household expenses, and now she has more responsibility in her own home. Her 15 years of experience in this business have enabled her to manage properly in the business. What's more she has a large quantity of customers who order from her monthly. Everyday she visits her regular customers and in the afternoons she goes searching for new people to offer them her products with the aim of increasing her orders. Currently, Luisa has set a new project into motion, which is installing a store in her home, a location which is still in construction, but soon will function as a beauty products store. It is due to this project that Luisa is working her hardest during her work hours, carrying out large trips down the streets of her town in search of customers. In the 14 loans that she has had with Microfinanzas PRISMA, she has worked with her communal bank in a very responsible way, thanks to the effort put out by each of her partners. With the 2000 soles that she is requesting now she will buy a larger quantity of beauty products, especially those most requested by her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Heather Nicholson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":356324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-23T01:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":295.59},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":311.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":325.98},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":339.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":355.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":371.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.76},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.28},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.02},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":99.76,"local_amount":295.59,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":302.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641607},{"amount":105.28,"local_amount":311.95,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":319.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081047},{"amount":110.02,"local_amount":325.98,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":333.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997197},{"amount":114.42,"local_amount":339.03,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":347.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842541},{"amount":245.52,"local_amount":727.45,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":745.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734117}],"funded_date":"2009-07-28T16:55:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicholson","image":null}},{"id":127949,"name":"Pelenatete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pelenatete F.

Lesa is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Lesa from HSPFI.

Her daily income varies from 15,000 to 20,000 francs.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans to boost her business by purchasing plastic items such as baskets, bowls, basins, bowls, buckets, as well as sweets (candy, cookies), hair extensions (pony, Afro, darling, x-pression, olive, English), underwear (slips, bras) and many other things.Her strategy is to set up an appealing display of her merchandise to attract customers, to give them a proper greeting, and to accumulate daily savings.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to open a big shop, get a piece of land, and provide good living conditions for her children. She is a good representation of the women in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

She currently lives alone for personal reasons. Chibalonza M. sells used shoes, called \"ketch\", after finding a spot along the street.\r\n\r\nShe started her business with her own funds, 50$, that she got from commissions on shoe sales transactions she facilitated. Later on, she benefited from a $50 loan from Kiva's partner, the microfinance institution Hekima. She's been running her business for 13 years, and she will use her loan to get new supplies (35 pairs of shoes).\r\n\r\nShe ambitions to expand her business, see her children study comfortably, and buy them a land lot. Chibalonza M. thanks Hekima for its actions targeting poor women who do not get access to loans from regular banks.

is 21 years old, not married.

To have some kind of additional income Shahnoza has been drying fresh apricots during the season for the past three years. The technology is simple and does not require any hard labor. In the early mornings the apricots are collected into boxes and after being burned in sulfur are lied on the sun to dry. After a couple of days the seeds are taken out and the fruit is dried more. The ready made dry apricots are then collected into sacks and then sold closer to autumn when the price for them is higher. The profits from this business helps support the family.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale.  Gloria has been engaged in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Gloria joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.  Gloria is now requesting a new loan of 3000 WST for the same purpose.  The loan will be her fourth loan from Kiva partner SPBD.  Gloria plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Nyachiewo B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Nyagul river. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Mary and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nMary works as a subsistence farmer, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Mary and three other promoters in her community, including Irine, Josia and Melda, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Mary will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Mary wants to be a promoter because she believes that the chlorine will kill bacteria in water, hence making water safe for drinking and improving overall health.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Mary\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josia ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":990156,"name":"Tsilaviniaina","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Tsilaviniana a 20 ans, et est encore c\u00e9libataire.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is a hard-working, responsible person who has provided public transportation services for several years.  He tells us that when he started out in this occupation he didn\u2019t do too well because customers often would not pay the full fare; he has a lot of anecdotes about those days.\r\n\r\nCarlos plans to get ahead with this line of work; to see that his wife and children succeed, that they become professionals and can reach whatever goals they set up for themselves.\r\n\r\nCarlos will continue to work because days don\u2019t stop coming and he must continue to feed his family because he is their only source of support.\r\n\r\nOne of his dreams is to buy his own house because he currently rents and this is a big expense for him.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested funds to buy replacement parts for his vehicle.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful to Emprender and to Kiva for the trust placed in him in

She is also thinking about embarking on a business selling potatoes, vegetables and cheeses at the general stores in the Peruvian jungle because she knows she can earn a good income from her sales.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through MFP and, at recent meetings, she observed the mechanics of how her cooperative group works, which she enjoyed because she was able to learn about other members\u2019 experiences.

Julieta reached college before getting married to Aristardo, a businessman. At present, they work hand-in-hand in making their business grow and become sufficient enough to support their daily living. Julieta uses her learning from CCT* as a Community Partner to boost her business.  Together, they lived in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n<p>\r\nBeing a fruits vendor is Julieta's main occupation. She has a commercial space in the public market of their community, where daily she sells fresh fruits to household people who go to the market to buy some real food. Other than fruits, she also sells barley products. This business she operates without any employees working for her, and monthly she earns roughly Php 12,000.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her grow her business, Julieta applies for a Php 8,000 loan. She will use the money to buy more quantities of fruits for sale, specifically bananas and mangoes. She also plans to buy supplementary materials like salt and plastic. \r\n<p>\r\nJulieta admits having lots of competitors in the market that have the same products she has. Also, the death of her mother led them to use part of the capital to pay medical expenses. But Julieta believes that she can surpass these challenges and make her business grow. She plans to have a commercial space for a fruit stand in a shopping mall, where more people can serve as prospective customers. Julieta desires to make her business really profitable, because by it she can assure a bright future for her family, her utmost treasure.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n<p>\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":710185,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

proudly calls herself a fashion designer. She is 41 and single with three children. She also cares for eight dependents. For the past three years, she has operated a storefront where she has two sewing machines. One is electric and one is manual, used when the electricity goes out. Her clients choose a pattern from one of the pattern books, then they select the material. When their choices are made, Gertrude quotes a price, which is often less than what the item would cost in a store. Sometimes a customer wants to buy a gomesi, or traditional dress. This is only sold as a custom-made garment and can be quite elaborate. \r\nThere are different levels of tailoring shops in the villages. Some are simple, on the street: just a bag of scrap cloth, a foot-powered sewing machine, some thread and a bench to sit on. Others, like Gertrude's, have a storefront, with several sewing machines, a variety of cloth and embroidery to choose from and books from which to choose patterns. \r\nGertrude learned this trade as a young girl, and it is very good for young girls to have a skill if they don't get formal education. Often in villages, it is considered more important that boys stay in school. Without a formal education, young girls become very vulnerable. So, learning a trade or skill which can be practiced in their village is vital. \r\nTo become a tailor is usually a two-year course. During these two years, girls learn sewing skills, independence and self-esteem. The people that start these schools usually have a shop themselves and the classes are a labor of love for these young girls. Gertrude exudes confidence, a confidence born by learning a skill.

This is 50-year-old Halima N. from mbeya. She is a widow with five children between the ages of 19 and 32. Since 2005, Halima has been running a bar where she sells soda, beer and pure drinking water. She works at the business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Her bar is a good place to relax with a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. You can relax on a plastic chair under a tree with a local beer in your hand and the aroma of roasting mishikaki  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to everyone who happens to wander by.\r\n<p>\r\nHalima currently earns about 100USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 250USD in order to purchase additional stocks of beer, water, and soda. She plans to increase both the quantity and range of the stock. Halima thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":216240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of beer, water, and soda.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T01:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T04:31:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":62775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970712},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":62775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886929},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":62775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436189},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":62775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130462},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":62774.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027264}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T03:31:59Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":74747,"name":"Ok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ok E. is a villager in Prey Kduoch village in Takeo Province.

husband and their four children. Hiyam has owned a bakery since 2003. She has a saj oven in which she does mankoucheh or markouk. The saj is the metal oven where you make the saj bread, a traditional Lebanese cooking dome used to make Markouk (thinned) bread, doughy confections or mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza and its most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it any time of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning.\r\n<p>\r\n Hiyam requested a loan of $1,000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase raw materials for her work and change the d\u00e9cor of her bakery. This is the first time that Hiyam has requested a loan.\r\n<p>\r\nHiyam is special in her work because she does it well and she is also the only one who does it in her neighborhood. Her clients are her friends and neighbors. When she first started her business, she was lucky to not have any difficulties. Hiyam decided on doing her business because her mankoucheh is good and plus, she always wanted to open a bakery. In the future, she plans on improving her business.

Sdau village in Takeo province.  Mrs. Chek P. was selected the President of the group by its members.  She is a good cook, hired by the villagers during wedding ceremonies and parties.  Her husband, Mr. Yim Phorn, is a farmer who owns a 1-hectar field on which he cultivates rice. This field has infertile soil which is a challenge, because it affects his crop production. Fertilizer would help make the field more productive.  Mrs. Chek P. decided to ask for a loan to buy the fertilizer.  She is 37 years old and the mother of four children, one of whom is a waiter, two are enrolled in the local school and the youngest is too young to work or study. <p>\r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. The other group members have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

This community is in the District of Mochumi, Lambayeque Province, located one hour away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlberto has been pursuing music for more than 6 years.  He studied at an institute in Chiclayo and learned how to play the trombone.  He currently works with a few bands and orchestras in the region who hire him as needed.  Alberto uses his earnings to contribute toward the household and cover his personal expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nHe says that he is proud that his family recently formed a band called \u201cUnion and Progress\u201d.  For now they are working hard to buy all the instruments they need to become official and start booking engagements.\r\n<p>\r\nSince the family band is in need of capital and his earnings are not enough to cover the start-up costs, Alberto decided to start a business selling clothing.  He plans to buy the merchandise in Chiclayo and sell his products to residents of the surrounding villages since public transportation is not available.  For this reason, he is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis greatest hope is that his band will be successful and become recognized nationally.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She does all her sales on credit, because she has a large quantity of profitable customers, mainly participants of the Christian community she attends and shares the teachings of God for men. In addition,  Giovana has more income from offering the service of renting washing machines and selling packaged snacks. Lately she has also been selling Chitos, green Tajaditas, Maduras, Cheesballs and more to the customers who use her washing machine service.

Her dream is to keep growing the business so that in the future she will have her own clothing and shoe store.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from serving a variety of different meals like adobo, fried chicken & fish soup to customers in the local community. She is also selling bread & serves coffee. Fe has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase food & drinks for the restaurant. Fe is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business like putting up a retailing store. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Fe from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has six children ranging in age from 16 to 32.  She lives in the 20 de Julio neighborhood located in the south of the city.  It\u2019s notable because formal and informal commerce interphase here along with sports and recreational venues, shopping centers, banking and residential complexes.  Most significant of all, though, this community has one of Colombia\u2019s most important sports infrastructures which very soon will become the scene of Sub 20 World Football.  Because of this, all the local merchants in the area are gearing up for the avalanche of customers that will descend on the city of Barranquilla from all parts of Colombia and from other countries.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s in this heterogeneous environment that Luz has a business where she sells beverages like beer, soft-drinks, \u201cchicha de ma\u00edz\u201d (drink made from a base of fermented corn), Pony Malta (pasteurized non-alcoholic malt beverage), ice, hot-dogs, \u201csalchipapas\u201d (fried potatoes with fried sausages) and hamburgers.  She started in 1985 because she\u2019d been a merchant since she was a very young; back in 1978 she was already a merchant.\r\n\r\nHer customers are friends, neighbors, referred people and passersby that amble through the commercial corridor where she\u2019s located.  Although her main challenge is the large amount of competition, she stays in business thanks to fair prices and thanks to her natural kindness and vocation of service that are favorable for her retaining customers.\r\n\r\nHer liquidity is twofold and her profit margin is no less than 15%.  Her goal is to gradually increase it through financing because her working capital is small and her goal now is to make it grow to increase clientele and with that, her income.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason behind her starting credit history asking Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for a Kiva loan to buy soft-drinks, ice and baked goods.  Later on she plans to add an Internet Caf\u00e9 because she dreams with her children becoming involved and generating income through a family

This family lives in a cozy home in the district of Tapo.  Fredy learned about agriculture from his father and uncles who also live in this area which is known for its mineral-rich land.  This hard-working father grows peas, potatoes, lima beans, carrots, spinach, etc.  He also raises and sells livestock such as cows and donkeys.  He usually makes an average of 30 to 50 PEN per donkey and 150 to 200 PEN per cow.  \"The price of vegetables decreases sometimes and some can go bad over time, so I have to risk selling them at those prices.  But I have never lost money, somehow I always get a return on my investment\", he explains.  His wife helps him on the land by aerating it in the afternoons.  During planting or harvest season Fredy hires workers and pays them a daily wage.  He is able to save money this way so he can expand his house in the future.  \"I would like to add on more rooms for my children and other relatives\", he says.  This is his 8th loan through MFP.  He is very grateful to the entity for the enterprise opportunities he has had and he hopes to continue in this vein and is committed to paying back the loan on time.

Five members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor, allowing them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

Alimardon's wife milks the cows twice per day, in the mornings and evenings, and uses some of the milk to make butter, cottage cheese, kefir and heavy cream.  Alimardon's mother sells unused part of the milk and dairy products at a market every morning.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlimardon started his animal husbandry business 5 years ago.   He bought two sheep and a cow, raised them and sold them at a market.  Using the profits he received from the sale, he bought lambs and a calf, and his quantity of lambs now consisted of 4 heads.  And he has been doing so for 5 years already.  Alimardon plans to increase the quantity of his livestock by breeding it.  This is why he put in a request for a loan to feed his domestic livestock.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":356492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For feeding livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimardon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":128013,"name":"Rukiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukiah is widowed and has seven children.
