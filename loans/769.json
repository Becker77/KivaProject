It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These problems made life very difficult for him. It was a great hardship for him to sponsor his five children in school until the year 2000 when he saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.\r\n\r\nHe is convinced that his business will succeed because of his business experience. He is well known in the community.

With these benefits, he will enjoy a better and more comfortable life. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because it includes training before the loan is disbursed and proper follow-up to ensure proper use of the loan. Also, the method of repayment is convenient and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Janete thanks God that her life has meaning after the circumstances that she had to endure.  After her mother died, she was raised by her grandfather but he also passed away much later.  An aunt helped to support her since her father had abandoned the family.  \r\n<p>\r\nJanete lives in the neighborhood of Pablo \u00dabeda.  Her plans include being able to finish securing her house.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to purchase stone, cement, sand, and iron to build a security wall behind her house.  This will provide safer conditions since there is frequent crime in her neighborhood due to high unemployment throughout the country.  She thanks the Institution for the opportunity to make these improvements to her home and providing an easy way for her to make her loan payments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

He lives with his mother and three younger siblings. For the last four years he has been working as a mechanic, and with his income he helps support the family and provide them with a decent standard of living.\r\n\r\nBecause of his excellent work, Javier has many customers who regularly need his services. Recently he was given the opportunity to start his own small business at the entrance to the city. Up till now he has worked out of his house and didn't have anywhere to meet his customers. He had to take the vehicles to other places to mend them, entailing extra expenses.\r\n\r\nA friend has offered to rent him a place where he can do everything on site. That means that Javier now has to equip the workshop with tools for all kinds of vehicles, so he has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan. He wants to buy the most widely used tools, but is also thinking of buying special tools for less common vehicles.\r\n\r\nJavier works every day except Sundays when he goes to church as he is strong Christian. Because of his beliefs he is very responsible and honest. The loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will enable him to have a greater number of customers and thus increase his income. He will be able to expand his workshop and help his siblings and mother get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":884086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

This is Kulsoom and her team: Elvin (to her left) and Fabrice (to her right). \n\nKulsoom is in charge of Juhudi Labs, an adventurous entity within Juhudi Kilimo, dedicated to discovering, testing and scaling new financial and agricultural products, services and processes. Fabrice is a marketing associate and Elvin is the Kiva Coordinator. They both work with Kulsoom on various development projects.\n\nThe 3 of them believe that success is in rallying coalitions of partners and mobilizing resources to lift smallholder farmers out of extreme poverty by broadening their access to education and financial inclusion. They are concerned that emerging challenges in Kenya such as climate change, conflict, and volatility of commodity prices threaten to erode decades of fragile gains in development we have made. It is for this reason that they have partnered with the following 3 start-up companies to make a difference:\n\n1. Future Pump.\n2. Ojay Greene\n3. F3 Life\n\nThey are seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to pay for 3 video productions that will feature the business profiles for each of the 3 start-ups. The video will give the start-up ventures a great milestone in terms of material for fundraising and marketing, which is necessary for them if they are to meet their business objectives of forming strategic partnerships and creating brand awareness.\n\nFuture Pump is a company that produces a solar-powered water pump (called a Sunflower pump) for use in irrigation. The Sunflower pump is a low-cost pump intended to pump fresh water from underground reservoirs for irrigating farmland. A single pump can use solar energy to lift 13,000 litres per day, enough to irrigate an average small-scale farm.\n\nOjay Greene Ltd produces and aggregates fresh produce from local farmers to sell to regional urban supermarkets. The company also provides smallholder farmers with consultation services that touch on food production, marketing, and training packages to enable them to adopt sustainable agricultural techniques in order to produce high-quality produce to supply to urban supermarkets.\n\nF3 Life provides training, on-site technical farming advice and credit to smallholder farmers to promote profitable, sustainable, and climate-resilient farming in the important watershed areas of Kenya. F3 Life\u2019s credit facility has a \u2018credit ladder\u2019 which allows clients to build a credit history, demonstrate cash flows, and build collateral to enable them to secure loans from formal financial institutions. Further, loan terms include requirements for soil and water conservation measures to prevent soil erosion.\n\nYour loan will help Kulsoom, Elvin and Fabrice pay for the production of professional videos about these start-ups. They shall help the ventures to utilize the videos to unlock new opportunities in education, funding, and strategic partnerships in order to scale their business and impact various areas such as:\n\n1. Boosting Agricultural Productivity and livelihoods in Kenya\nKenya has an 82% dependency ratio. 75% of the Kenyan workforce is dependent on agriculture for a living, the majority working on small farms. There is a huge deficit in basic skills and access to finances, meaning that yields and income are far below the potential.\n\n2. Expanding access to energy\nClean renewable energy programs that Juhudi Kilimo has rolled out have had a transformative effect on poor people\u2019s lives. They have provided lighting, clean cooking, and phone charging. Future Pump focuses on income-generating opportunities such as irrigation. They are targeting rural smallholder farmers who live in off-the-grid zones and rely on solid fuels to meet their daily needs.\n\n3. Improving financial inclusion\nRural smallholder farmers in Kenya have little or no access to formal financial services. They are unable to put their meager and unpredictable incomes into bank accounts and are therefore unable to save or take loans. Lack of credit keeps them from purchasing essential goods and services.\n\nThe partnership with the start-ups seeks to take full advantage of the explosion of the mobile phone market in Kenya by seizing an opportunity to use innovative, mobile-based solutions to provide inclusive, branchless financial services to rural farmers. We see mobile phones as a way of facilitating low-margin, high-volume business, as well as dramatically increasing the reach.\n\n4. Increasing access to education\nEducation is the cornerstone of poverty reduction. Education leads to many other development benefits besides improving income.

She also has a stall on Isaac Tamayo Street in La Paz, where she sells hats by the dozen every morning. This is one of the city\u2019s streets that gets a lot of traffic and is dominated by the informal sector. Her hat production is by the dozen, since she sells in bulk to her buyers, who then sell the hats individually; through her business, she indirectly generates several jobs. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the fifth loan Ernestina has obtained through IMPRO. Her history with our institution qualifies her as a Level 1 client, that is to say, Very Good in payment of her obligation.

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

They request a second loan of 100 000 FCFA per member, which is 500 000 FCFA per sub-group, to develop their various activities. However, the contributions are paid to the President, assisted by the Treasurer of the group, Ms. Seck Coumba during their monthly meetings and they are responsible to refund U-IMCEC. The network, accordng to the president, has only one noble goal: to fight family poverty. The network currently has 19 subgroups, each with a chairman and a treasurer. F.C. No. 6, is chaired by Mrs. Bousso D., who is 43 years of age and mother of 7 children; she has been selling vegetables, peanuts, dried fish and palm oil for five years . The Treasurer is Mrs. C. Moussou, who has been selling palm oil and dried fish for four years at the market place in Thies. The other members are Ms. Oumy G., who sells rice, millet and oil, Ms. Soda L., who sells fresh fish and Ms. Coumba F. who sells vegetables.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by MONICA URBAN, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":516478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bousso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759328},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790842},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971276},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-22T09:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708551},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922597},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189105},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484535},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620779}],"funded_date":"2010-03-31T03:22:29Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"MONICA URBAN","image":1592573}},{"id":194046,"name":"Pacencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pacencia D.

Valencia is 39 years old and lives in the Villa del Carmen neighborhood, within the Soledad Municipality in the Atlantic Department  with her husband and her 3 children, between ages 10 and 15.  She has a general store that sells a little bit of everything, from pencils to accessories, perfumes and other items.  It's a family business that started because she needed to make important contributions toward supporting her household and also to fulfill her community's needs.  While her shop sells all sorts of products, the most useful items are the school and general stationary supplies; taking advantage of the fact that her business is next to a school.  \r\n\r\nThis is her second credit with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Since her first credit, she has noticed an increase in sales and also a wider profit gap from being able to make her stock purchases in cash with her credit.  It worked like a low cost work capital.  Now, with her Kiva credit, she is going to stock her shop with pencils, pens, notebooks, overalls, blouses, bracelets, earrings, perfume and cologne.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is for her children to earn a University degree and for her business to be known not only in her neighborhood but in the entire area.  As such, her greatest challenge is to make a name for her business in the sector, taking advantage of the fact that she lives in a neighborhood where the availability of inexpensive merchandise is in high demand and this is exactly what she is commercializing off of with her general store.   \r\n\r\n      \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva

She is 45 years old. Aurora is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAurora is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Aurora owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Aurora has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Aurora joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aurora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. Aurora is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the product offering. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Aurora from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

L. was born on January 1, 1980 in Ghana.  Married to Pierre DOSSOUGOUIN, a welder by profession, she is the mother of two children, who are both in school, in the 6th grade and in kindergarten, respectively.  Trained as a master hairdresser, Ms. Rosine L. used to practice her trade in a shop in Xwlacodji  behind the public primary school in that area, and she used to market cosmetics there, too.  But with the rarity of customers, she dedicated herself much more to selling these cosmetic products and moved towards the downtown, in the Sik\u00e8codji district, while still marketing cosmetics.  To do so, she came to apply for an initial loan of 30,000 francs CFA enabling her to stock enough supplies.  It was a very profitable experience because her capital accrued and the demand grew, such that she lacked, due to means, the merchandise to meet the demand.  The profit that she earns from this business enables her to support her family.  One loan after another, since the demand is ever-growing, she is presently requesting her fifth loan in the amount of 180,000 francs CFA in order to achieve these objectives.   \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nL.

The Triunfadoras (or \u201cThe Triumphant\u201d) formed as a communal bank less than one year ago.  Because they are a new group, their loan amounts are small, varying between three and eight hundred Nuevo Soles.  They meet monthly in one bank member\u2019s home on Pomorrosa Street in a suburb of Pucallpa, Peru.  The city is a bustling regional capital and major transportation hub of the Amazon River basin area in eastern Peru.  The construction of the highway fifty years ago, linking Pucallpa to Lima, marked the beginning of a new epoch for the booming capital.  No other city in the jungle is connected to the country\u2019s capital by a paved road; for this reason, all major shipping throughout the Amazon Basin to Lima passes through Pucallpa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe women of this communal bank all work in and around Pucallpa, operating small businesses from corner stores out of their homes to stalls in local markets.  The majority of the women in the \"Las Triunfadoras de Marko Jara\" bank sell some sort of product for a living.  The Triunfadoras are requesting loans of individual amounts, but they collectively guarantee the repayment of the entire bulk loan.  The bank members will be using the loan to fund a variety of endeavors including: sales of vegetables, shoes, candy, bananas, furniture, and bottled drinks.  Each woman will repay her portion of the bulk loan within the same four-month term.<P>\r\n\r\nThe bank members requesting a group loan are: Milena Liliana G. F. (s\/.500), Danitza Ivette M.

Lorraine. She is a wife to Loue and an entrepreneur to many of her customers. Maribeth enjoys every single day of her life playing different roles being a woman. At the age of 27, she became a member of ASHI. She made a loan, and she found herself running a business she enjoyed the most, buying and selling fish. Five years ago, Maribeth was still in the process of discovering the secret towards business success. As she goes along with her discovery, loans she made in ASHI have helped her. Eventually she found what she was looking for - happiness being the owner and manager of her own business. She has grown and produced another kind of business out of her profit- a variety store. \r\n\r\nFrom a PHP5,000 loan she made when she first joined ASHI, now she makes a PHP24,000 loan to be used to finance her fish business and her variety store. She plans to add shrimp, prawn, and crab to the items she sells. \r\n\r\nSomeday, Maribeth wants all of her children to finish college and have their own career. She would be very happy to see them enjoying a life that is not under the umbrella of poverty.

C. is a member of the Picoaza Communal Bank. This communal bank is made up of women of all ages. Picoaza is a small town located ten minutes north of Portoviejo, in the province of Manabi on the coast of Ecuador. This province is well know for its cuisine, its beaches, and ceibo trees (trees unique to this region). This area is not an exception though, and is very commercial: here there are a lot of distributors of agricultural products, consumer goods, clothing, etc.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda's husband is a bus driver in Portoviejo. The couple lives with their son and their grandson Wilmer. Our member has a small store where she sells groceries and also prepares food to sell to neighbors and other people from the area. She tells us she started this business to help her family during these difficult times.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda likes to work with Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR because of the benefits it offers compared to its competitors. She says the education that all the members receive teaches them more about family planning and finance, and how to invest their money. The funds from this loan will be invested in the business through the purchase of rice, sugar, salt, bread, and other basic products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva

She earns about 5,000 MZN per month, which she uses to pay for her family's expenses.  She even saves some through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 6th loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.

Her husband works as a courier at the Yanbal cosmetics factory. They live in the city of Cuenca, where they can enjoy the colonial beauty of a historical center. The rivers nourish the city, people and gastronomy, making it one of the most visited places in the country by natives and foreigners. Adriana dedicates herself to the household chores and caring for her niece. On Saturdays, she works cleaning other people's homes until midday. Her friend Alexandra encouraged her to join this group of enterprising women, which joined forces with Kiva partner Comunal Pro Mujer to make headway for their families and to have more and better opportunities for personal and economic advancement. This is the group's first loan, and with her portion Adriana plans to start a small bazaar for which she will purchase cards, stuffed animals, gifts, jewelry, school supplies, clothing, and other personal and household products. Her goal is to resume her studies since she has a first-grade education.\r\n\r\nSandra D. is another member of the community bank, and she lives in the city with her husband and their three children, ages 22, 21 and 17, all of whom are either studying in college or high school. It is not her own home, but her in-laws live in a separate area. Because her husband is a veterinarian, he runs his office out of the home to save on expenses. Sandra has worked as an employee at a private collection agency for the city's electric company for the past five years. She works Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. This is her first loan with the community bank, and with the money she plans to pay for her son's university education. Her biggest dream is to have her own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Along with her husband and two children, she has a workshop that they have had for many years.  They were born in the pretty Jun\u00edn canton in the Manab\u00ed province.  In this area the inhabitants work in agriculture and livestock production, and they also sell agricultural products.  But this time our member has a different occupation.  She sells spare parts for bicycles, and in addition, her husband and children repair bicycles.  The small workshop that they have in their own home is in a separate area dedicated to the business.

This is the capital of Manab\u00ed province, where she can purchase the items she needs, such as spare parts, metal paints, and other accessories.  She already has a place where she buys wholesale; in this way she gets good profits.  Up to this date, Isabel has not had any problems with the payments on her loans.  She is very responsible and hopes to continue working in the same business.  She enjoys it very much, and it makes her whole family happy, because with all of these years of work this couple has been able to provide their children with an education and raise them to be good men.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":534139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy metal paint and bicycle accessories   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T23:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709144},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892443},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632803},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846837}],"funded_date":"2010-05-07T07:19:20Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":202257,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith B. is a trained and qualified nurse who operates a pharmacy located in the eastern part of the city.

She joined ASHI, the first kiva field partner, and she was encouraged by the stories of poor women of ASHI. She wanted to become successful like them and use loans in her business.  Because of the opportunity of receiving loans, Maria was able to start a business buying and selling vegetables.  She is courageous enough to take all the risk of running a business.  She thought she could be successful because her husband is there to support her and because of a dream she kept in her mind of having all of her children finish their schooling through the completion of college. \r\n\r\nNow she is requesting a new loan for the amount of 25,000 PHP. The loan fund will be used to pay for inventories of vegetables. She believes with more stock she will attract more customers in their village.\r\n\r\nMaria Fe has never hoped for anything more than for her family and her children not to experience the hard life she and her husband has experienced. She dreams of building a new concrete and spacious house and expanding the business. \r\n \r\nMaria Fe\u2019s one hope and dream is to alleviate her family from poverty. Maria Fe is very pleased to be a Kiva borrower and says thank you for helping fund her business

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for house repairs.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

De La Esperanza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Santiago Atitlan has been a major city since early Mayan times and is situated on the hillside of beautiful Lake Atitlan. Atitlan is known around the lake for the strong presence of the Mayan Tzutujil people. \r\n\r\nDespite this interesting background and beautiful scenery, the women from the group tell me this town can be dangerous at times. This is especially true for women, who are already greatly under pressure to keep their families running, and sometimes deal with attacks and suffer from the hard laws of the street. The troubled times caused by the Civil War during the eighties have influenced Santiago's contemporary reality very much; this is why Conception, who does most of the talking for the group, thinks that life in Santiago is, even today, a difficult one.\r\n \r\nPride and the continuing search for a better life keeps the women of this group going and they are working hard to improve their lives and the lives of the ones they love.\r\n\r\nMost of the women work in embroidery. The Santiago Atitlan embroidery is delightful. Artisans will weave beautiful birds and Mayan symbols in their typical blouses called Guipiles.  For almost all of the women this is their second, third or fourth loan. There are even some women who came from another group and have managed to establish their lives quite well after 8 years of microfinance loans, says Josefa, who is one of them herself. Josefa is the president of the group. While working in her convenience shop that she has managed to build, she works on embroidery too. She is also very happy to be able to help the younger members of the group to learn how to invest their credit well. \r\n\r\nConception says that it is everybody's wish to take advantage of every opportunity they have to talk to foreigners. This is because talking to foreigners is an opportunity for them to show their beautiful art to the world and this can become an opportunity to sell or even export their goods to other countries. Selling their products to foreigners will generate the earnings they deserve, especially during the tough rainy season when the prices of their weavings drop dramatically and the competition increases. This is because there is too much competition in the local market and their weavings are sold at very low prices. This means they sometimes have to sell their products under production costs just to get some money for future investments. The rest of the group very much agreed with her and gave Conception a round of applause because she has expressed herself well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":194598,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Invest

His entire life has been devoted to cultivating his fields. He plants coffee, bananas and also during this season he plants caigua (a vine which grows a small gourd-shaped fruit, used as a vegetable). He grew up with farming activities because his father was a farmer, and he knows how and when to grow each product. He likes taking care of the plants because the process for each is different. He is concerned about the price of guano (manure from sea birds) and other fertilizers because he invests a lot and earns very little. But his dreams are based on farming. In time he would like to have a house made of solid material, not of wood as he now has. He and his wife are trying to buy their own house so they have something to leave as an inheritance to their children as well as giving them a good education, something which neither were able to have. With a loan he will fertilize his caigua fields so they blossom and bear fruit. He will also plant more pacay (a Peruvian leguminous tree, cultivated for its large white edible pods) in his orchard. If he is able to finish fertilizing and fumigating the caigua and everything goes well, he will be able to harvest a large amount this summer and get a good price.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":215325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in organic and chemical fertilizers for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-19T18:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-02T20:01:45Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957450},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227700},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422935},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116159},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011119},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":88.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594722}],"funded_date":"2008-10-19T19:01:45Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":74419,"name":"Mrs. Reaksmey Sar Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan which consists of twelve people is located in Ta Reab Doun S. village in Kandal Province.

She is 40 years old, is married, and has four adult children.\n\nHelen owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2004, Helen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase piglets to raise and sell.\n\nHelen is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. This loan will be her 4th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<\/em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Along with her husband, she is dedicated to clearing their croplands, turning the soil, sowing, fertilizing and fumigating for 7 to 8 months their crop of potatoes and olluco (an Andean root vegetable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Barot launched his business over 6 years ago. His business is known for its reasonable pricing policy and free delivery service. One of his plans for the near future is to buy a facility for his business that he could own instead of renting a building. \n\nBarot is always on the go. He is very determined and knows how to achieve his goals. This time Barot is seeking a 1500 USD loan to purchase foodstuffs to expand his inventory. He is hoping to use the generated profit to finish remodeling his apartment, which he couldn\u2019t complete due to financial constraints.  \n \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Su negocio inici\u00f3 con el apoyo de su esposo, quien invirti\u00f3 un peque\u00f1o capital producto de sus ahorros cuando trabaj\u00f3 en una empresa, en un principio Eva vend\u00eda mercanc\u00edas variadas entre sus vecinas y poco a poco agreg\u00f3 vitrinas y capital  de trabajo, producto de 20 cr\u00e9ditos recibidos hasta hoy por parte de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con los que ha logrado, extender su clientela y hacer compras de contado en un mayor volumen financiando as\u00ed, su cartera de cr\u00e9dito de clientes.

This area is also adjacent to the towns of Soledad, Sabanagrande, and Santo Tom\u00e1s.  Malambo is known for having a special demographic composition because the residents are a mix of people from all over the country.  They came to work either independently, for a company, or as part of the Malambo Industrial Park, S.A. (or PIMSA), which is an industrial complex that provides a complete infrastructure of services.  This complex was designed to ensure cost savings to companies that located their facilities there and would guarantee a sufficient pool of labor to the local businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nEva has a business called \u201cVariedades Eva\u201d (Eva\u2019s Varieties) where she sells sewing supplies, stationery, women\u2019s accessories, and household goods.  She has a customer base that knows her because of her work and her warm personality.  Her customers can find a little bit of everything they need.  Her business was started with the help of her husband, who invested a small amount of capital from his savings when he worked at a company.  At first, she began selling various products to her neighbors and gradually over time she acquired display cabinets and more operating capital.  As of now, Eva has received 20 loans through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She used the money to expand her customer base, make larger cash purchases, and extend lines of credit to her customers.   Eva still remembers the first loan she received, which was in the amount of 180,000 COP.  She received subsequent loans and used them to grow.  As a result, she was nominated to receive the City Bank Award for her excellence in developing her business.  This reflects her growth and the formalization of her business process.  Even though there have been significant challenges since starting her business three years ago, the insecurity of recent times has greatly diminished her operating capital.   However, this impasse has caused her to move forward intelligently and effectively manage this crisis. \r\n<p>\r\nEva is now applying for a Kiva loan in order to buy sewing supplies, women\u2019s accessories, and stationery.  She plans to restock her business with products that sell very quickly.  By managing her inventory, Eva will be able to reduce transportation costs and create opportunities to increase her sales because of her ability to obtain good discounts.  While Eva moves forward with her daily work, she is able to achieve profitability of at least 30%, which has a significant impact on the welfare of her household.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Suzith has been engaged in his business for over one year and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Suzith joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Suzith is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Suzith from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

M. is 42years old. She is married and supports her family by operating 2 business ventures, a Sari-sari(general) store and a food vending business. Elvie lives in Sin-sin, Bato, Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her Sari-sari store and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3000. Elvie is now borrowing PHP 15000 that she could use as additional working capital. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Elvie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rudy's humble origins meant that he was unable to complete his education.  He only reached the second year of elementary school as he didn't have the financial means to continue.\r\n\r\nRudy started this business because he needed to work.  Over time he came to enjoy it and it also fed his family.  This has been Rudy's only business.  He works from home.  Rudy's wife is an elementary school teacher.  They help each other with the household chores as his work allows him to remain near his two youngest children who are in high school.\r\n\r\nRudy requested this loan to buy construction supplies so that he could improve the infrastructure of his home and repair his roof.  This will make his home safer and improve the conditions of his cobbler's workshop.  He would like to own modern shoe stitching machines and provide a better service to his customers.\r\n\r\nRudy's next goal is to increase his shoe sales so that he can sell the products he makes in different stores.  He would like to pay for a good education for his children so that they don't have to suffer the same situation of poverty and ignorance that he did due to the fact that he couldn't study."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":745418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction supplies to improve the infrastructure of his home.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":119972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a digital camera and pinnacle capture card.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-02T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marystella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-16T18:14:40Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":780000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159446},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184268},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211871},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240040},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268951},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298067},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328647},{"amount":57,"local_amount":65866.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-22T07:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":66291,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362580},{"amount":50.25,"local_amount":58066.64,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":58440.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347432},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":65418.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970052},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":65418.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886302},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":65000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":65418.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435661}],"funded_date":"2008-02-02T18:14:40Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":37564,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary M. is a married mother of five.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She lives in her own house with two of her daughters--Yulisa, 15, and Jerson, 11, who motivate her sacrifice and work. For the past five years, she has worked selling clothing like wool sweaters on Thursdays and Sundays in the fairs of Tarma city. She buys her merchandise in the city of Huancayo, where she can buy at a convenient price, which permits her to earn better profits. On the other days of the week, she works in her field. She enjoys this work a great deal. In order to reap a good harvest, she fertilizes her crops every season, and she uses a donkey to transport the fertilizers to her field. After fertilizing her seeds, she feeds the donkey until it is satisfied and thus prepares it to work again. During these years of working as a farmer and saleswoman, Dionisia has learned to take care of her plants as well as her customers. She knows that thanks to them, she will have enough money to take care of her children and give them an education, and thus improve their quality of life. This is her third loan with MFP. In her previous loans, she was very punctual and she hopes to continue this in the current loan cycle. She is very gracious in her communal bank and all the members care for her deeply.

As a result, the women of this group have taken it upon themselves to create work.  The members of this group have a desire to succeed in their businesses and to provide a better standard of living for themselves and their families. The women who produce bread have the goal of one day owning a bakery. The women involved in animal rearing hope to use this loan to increase their poultry sales.\r\nFor the women engaged in bread-making, a difficulty has been high costs for raw materials. Likewise, individuals involved in the rearing and sale of chickens have encountered obstacles such as high prices for animal feed and low market prices for poultry products.

She is 26 years old. Cindylou is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCindylou is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Cindylou owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different food products in the local community. Cindylou has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cindylou joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cindylou has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Cindylou is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Cindylou from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":526610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
