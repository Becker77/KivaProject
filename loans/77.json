R.. whose business is similar, and Clara Rosa M., the group's coordinator who supports herself by handcrafting clothing. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Ver\u00f3nica del Socorro F. sells meat from her home. She has been working in this business for more than 5 years. She has gone through difficult times, including moments when she was about to close the business. With the loan that Adim gave her, she has succeeded in buying  her products wholesale. As a result she is now able to compete on price with other butcher shops. \r\n\r\nShe is married, and has an adolescent son who helps her sell her products. Her husband helps cover household expenses with his own work. She hopes to be able to grow her business and to reach her goal of improving her home. Veronica comments that the Adim training she has received has taught her to better control her business and to improve herself as a person, as well.\r\n\r\nThe group plans to work the Adim through several cycles. All of the members are clear that they will be able to do so only if they are disciplined about their payments. The group has already received 4 loans; all of the members have imrproved their quality of life as a result.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJovelyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovelyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He began preaching at a local penitentiary to the inmates and prison guards, and one day an inmate was admiring the pants he was wearing, and asked him to sell them to him.  At this moment, Cesar realized that even inside the prison system there existed a market for the sale of merchandise.   He began to bring goods-clothes, shoes, and accessories- with him when he visited the prison, and little by little he established his business.  Cesar now visits the prison three days a week, on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. He is able to both preach, and make a living. In addition, he has two inmates who help him with his business on the weekends, when the demand is highest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cesar would like a loan so that he can invest in more merchandise as he has reached a point where the demand for his products outweighs what he is able to supply.

Her mother-in-law brought her to the village bank, and with her very first microloan, Fanny began a Nintendo arcade. She slowly accumulated televisions and gaming systems, and before she knew it, she was able to provide toys and a bed for her new baby son. As she is always looking for the best way to increase her business, Fanny recognized the need for internet in her community and decided to change gears and open an internet caf\u00e9. She sold her televisions and together with the profits, with the money she had been saving in the bank, and with her loans, she bought 7 computers and opened her new business. It continued to grow, and today, she and her husband run a beautiful and very busy internet caf\u00e9 with 12 computers, a new television for playing movies, and a large display of candy for her patrons to snack on.  All the neighborhood children pass in and out of her doors throughout the day, playing video games, meeting friends, and learning from the limitless resources the internet has to offer.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a professional goal, Fanny and her husband hope to buy the property next door and expand the internet caf\u00e9 to allow more computers and more customers. Fanny is incredibly grateful to her village bank for allowing the realization of her ambitious business goals. Without the loans and classes she has received for the past 2 years, she says she wouldn\u2019t know how to save her money and none of what she has today would have been possible. Fanny is requesting a loan of $500, with which she will replace two out-of-date computers with newer, faster models."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":84960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Replace two out-of-date computers with newer, faster models.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-18T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny Dareli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T02:40:25Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1497,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":374.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":374.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":374.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":374.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":374.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107576},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":374.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127465},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":374.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148188},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":374.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172611}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T02:40:25Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28494,"name":"Samnang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mr. P.

With the profit, she hopes to fix the roof of her house, which has been affected by the winter season that is currently battering the country. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda Cecilia dreams of having a large corral with many pigs, in order to achieve the peace of mind generated by having a solid business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":667184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy pigs to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2010-12-16T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191449842},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195871852},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201312787},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206182129},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":333332,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":348295.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211255513}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T02:17:59Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":262890,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora N. is a farmer from the town of Nkubu in eastern Kenya.

employees, and improve the flooring, which is not of appropriate material for the advancement of the micro-business. \n\nD\u00e1lida dreams of one day being able to generate more employment, and of

She is 38 years old, a shop owner and has 5 children, two of whom are still in secondary school.  Her other children live independently from her.  Her husband works in the mayor's office of Totogalpa, municipality of Le\u00f3n.  Rosalba was a homemaker, but she needed to help her husband with the household expenses.  In addition, she wanted a business that would allow her to be independent and earn her own money but at the same time to take care of her children.  And so her husband helped her to open a small grocery, which Rosalba has now had for 4 years.  Her younger children help her in the store after school, which allows her to go out to purchase merchandise to stock her store.  In addition to running the store, Rosalba sells clothing, shoes and cosmetics from a street stand as well as in her store.  Little by little she has been growing her business and contributing financially to their household.  Rosalba needs the loan to purchase clothing, shoes, cosmetics, basic grain inventory, canned goods, candies, milk, juice, soda and cleaning agents.  The loan will help her to stock up her grocery and to purchase general merchandise to sell.  Her next goal is to open a clothing store and to purchase display cases and mannequins to display the clothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":899492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing, shoes, cosmetics, basic grain inventory, canned goods, candies, milk, juice, sodas and cleaning agents.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-10-19T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":439.73,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.55,"local_amount":36.69,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T09:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244770102},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":37.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832666},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242586},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":37.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381859},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095401},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710032},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":37.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403471},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428427},{"amount":149.98,"local_amount":146.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":149.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613163}],"funded_date":"2011-11-14T02:17:05Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":353078,"name":"Sadek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

By profession, she is an artisan, specializing in the creation of traditional clothing. She has a workshop with two looms. She lives together with her husband and 4 children. She and her husband work in the same business, and they have an employee to help them with their work. For 25 years, they have made traditional clothing in their home, which is located in Paraje Chaquiral, in the canton of Quiaquix, Department of Totonicap\u00e1n, Guatemala. Currently, customer demand has been rising, but the prevailing economic conditions are not favorable enough to allow her to increase her capital.

Warlita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Warlita from GDMPC.

She lives in Barangay Bog-ot, Argao, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $185. \r\n\r\nCresencia is now borrowing 12,000 PHP so that she can purchase pig feed and vitamins.  This will be her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cresencia hopes to raise her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She earns a minimum of 800 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosalinda hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of having other stores in their area.

Furthermore, they value solidarity and want to help other women in their community prosper, not only financially, but also spiritually.\r\n\r\nDemonstrating team work and solidarity is an important part of the group's work.  They build work skills as a group and develop complementary businesses to generate income.  Among the business they are developing are: crafts, beauty products, general commerce and food-sales.\r\n\r\nTwo of the members have working businesses.  One operates a business making and selling tortillas and the other has a general retail business.  Another depends on her sewing machine to make clothes for men, women and children.  The women want to use this loan to support these businesses and start others.  The group expects to learn from their experience with existing businesses to help them create new ones.  They also want to be able to create businesses that will leave them time to care for their families.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their businesses, the women have worked together in the past to raise money for their church.  Now they are committed to working as a team to build their businesses and fulfill the terms and conditions of this loan.\r\n\r\nThe group has long experience making and selling tortillas, sewing and commerce.  They will use this loan to support their existing businesses, grow them and start others.  They can count on the equipment and customers that they have now.  The report finds that this group has fulfilled Banco Mujer's requirements for forming a community bank in terms of skills, commitment and ability to repay the loan.  They are ready to harvest the rewards of the seeds they've sown!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":906233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy supplies for their retail businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Poas, Chilamate","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2011-10-31T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Argentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosibel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":143872.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":146270.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":148708.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":151186.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":153706.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":156256.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":287.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":292.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":302.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":307.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":287.74,"local_amount":143872.3,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":145469.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250781393},{"amount":292.54,"local_amount":146270.17,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-28T08:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":147893.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259110019},{"amount":297.42,"local_amount":148708.01,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":150358.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263326292},{"amount":302.37,"local_amount":151186.47,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-21T07:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152864.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271078905},{"amount":307.41,"local_amount":153706.25,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":155412.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276652723},{"amount":312.52,"local_amount":156256.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":157991.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283497022}],"funded_date":"2011-11-03T13:22:37Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:26:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":357193,"name":"Camila Lyli","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Camila mujer trabajadora, emprendedora, comerciante tiene su negocio de venta de cosm\u00e9ticos y variedades que con sus propios esfuerzos ha alcanzado realizar mejoras en su forma de vida y mediante los prestamos ha sido de apoyo para lograr sus metas.

This type of work allows her to generate an income to support her family as much as possible, as she lives with her partner and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes best about Pro Mujer, Fedra says that she appreciates the health clinic.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, you can see Mrs. Orbelinda's husband who accompanied her to the disbursement.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":964015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase provisions for her food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-04T16:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonieta Lucia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fedra Vanidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orbelinda Olga\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeannethe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":11111.1,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.21},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1110.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.51,"local_amount":1111.21,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1114.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257277222},{"amount":325.03,"local_amount":2222.42,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2229.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418154},{"amount":487.55,"local_amount":3333.63,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3344.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133032},{"amount":325.03,"local_amount":2222.42,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2229.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749844},{"amount":324.88,"local_amount":2221.42,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2228.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243328}],"funded_date":"2012-01-04T21:17:01Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Fiona Craig","image":null}},{"id":381775,"name":"Chanh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Chanh is 52 years old with 2 children who are grown up.

He attended Gulu central high school for his A-levels and is currently single.<br><br>\r\nMorris started working at World Food Programme for 6 months, then he was with Caritas Gulu for a further 6 months. When his contract ended, he came back with the money raised and established a small barber shop together with a water tap. In this way, he has earned a living to supplement occasional short-term contracts with humanitarian organizations in Gulu.

He grew up with his parents and attended school until the 4th grade when he had to stop because of the war in 1982.  When he was 15 year old (1986) he began fishing with his father for six years and was able to arrange conditions for marriage in the church in 1992.  In the same year as is custom he went to South Africa where he worked for a fishing company for 8 years. He was able to save enough money that he came to Mozambique, bought a sail boat, and began fishing again.<p>\r\n\r\nHe asked for a loan through Hluvuku for 6.000,00MT to buy fishing nets.  With this work he is able to support a family of 8 people, his 5 children, his wife, and her parents.  With good management he was able to purchase 3 boats with motors and employ 4 workers plus others depending on the needs of the day.  When there are lots of waves (wind) he needs more workers to pull out the nets, and the number varies between 8 and 10 people.<p>\r\n\r\nThrough his experience as a sailor he was hired to be a boat driver by a tourist company that works in the area.  The job opened his eyes to offering transport services to take people and goods from Mozambique to South Africa and back, but he realized he did not have sufficient funds to pursue it unless he returned one more time to Hluvuku to ask for a loan of $1,200US to buy the vehicle in South Africa.  He will be able to hire 2 people, a driver and a helper.  Most likely he will consolidate his projects (fishing and transport) and be a reference in the community where poverty continues to affect more than 80% of the population.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p><p>\r\n\r\nDaniel Machecane N., de 36 anos de idade, natural de santa maria, posto administrativo de Machangulo, Distrito de Matutuine, Provincia do Maputo, cresceu junto com os pr\u00f3prios pais, tendo se escolarizado at\u00e9 4\u00aa Classe, onde deixou de continuar com os estudos  devido a guerra, isto em 1982.<p>\r\n   \r\nAos 15 anos (1986) come\u00e7ou actividade pesqueira junto do seu pai durante seis anos tendo conseguido criar condi\u00e7\u00f5es  para o casamento pela igreja em 1992, e no mesmo ano como costume da zona foi a Africa do sul, onde trabalhou numa empresa de pesca durante oito anos, dai poupou do seu sal\u00e1rio um valor que veio a Mo\u00e7ambique comprar um barco a vela e recome\u00e7ou a pesca em Mo\u00e7ambique.<p>\r\n\r\nTendo recorrido a Hluvuku pedir emprestimo no valor de 6.000,00mt para compra de redes de pesca.

She has worked with this institution for 6 years now and is on her second individual loan, all of which have been reimbursed properly.\r\n\r\n<p>She supplies herself generally twice a month at the local market in Sikasso from well-known wholesalers. Now, she intends to buy 5 bolts of Bazin (a cotton fabric), 20 cases of beverages, several boxes of cigarettes, matches, and various other items for her store in Mancourani I. She dyes the bazin for resale to the male and female clients who visit her store. She runs this business throughout the year without any major difficulties. Her sales are especially large during the time of festivals (Tabaski, Ramadan, etc.)\r\n\r\n<p>She intends to realize a monthly profit of 40,000 FCFA, which will help her meet the needs of her fatherless children.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mariam C. est une veuve de 49 ans et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants vivant  actuellement avec ses enfants dans la famille de son feu p\u00e8re qui lui a fait venir aupr\u00e8s de lui apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9poux.

Susana has owned a beauty salon for the past 17 years, which she started with her own efforts and which has allowed her to raise her family.  This is her seventh loan with Afodenic; previous loans have been of great benefit as she has invested them in buying inventory for her salon.  With this loan, she will buy a variety of products for her work, such as smoothing creams, hair dye, skin treatments and others as this is the season when people spend a little more and choose to change the look of their hair and change their image.

In the past, they have had problems harvesting, having to sell their crop in advance with reduced earnings. Normamad has gained a lot of experience in his business and his crop is now one of the most demanded at the market. He now faces a small problem because his field is infertile, which makes it difficult to grow his crop. To solve this problem, he has decided to request a loan to buy fertilizers to support the field and make his crop more productive.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling beauty products from Avon and Natasha in the local community. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nJocelyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Jocelyn from HSPFI.

The community in which the members live is quite beautiful because of the variety of animal and plant life that exists.  In addition, there is a river that runs through the town.  There are eleven members in the group who engage in the following activities:\r\n<p>\r\n\u2022\tAura sells automobile cleaning products.\r\n\u2022\tHortencia and Mar\u00eda sell snacks.\r\n\u2022\tCirila, Vianey, and Sara sell products through catalogs.\r\n\u2022\tHerminia prepares and sells tortillas.\r\n\u2022\tYsaura sells natural medicines and dinnerware.\r\n\u2022\tNatividad sells household goods.\r\n\u2022\tSocorro sells fish and soft drinks.\r\n\u2022\tHortencia sells tamales.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group representative is Sra. Hortencia S. A..  She is in a common law marriage with Sr. F\u00e9lix Raviera.  They have five children who are either high school or elementary school students.  Hortencia sells snacks such as tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, and \u201csopes\u201d (fried tortillas topped with refried beans, onions, and hot sauce).  She started this business fourteen years ago out of necessity because her husband did not have a job and they were in need of money.  For this reason, she started a small business.  Hortencia is requesting a loan to buy more supplies such as meat, vegetables, and other products that she needs.  With her earnings, she is able to sustain her family and provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother member of the group is Sra. Socorro.  Even though she is an elderly woman, Socorro works every day to provide for her daily needs.  She is single and has a grandson that she has been supporting since he was little.  Socorro is an admirable woman who knows how to press forward despite her age and the number of illnesses she has had to endure.  She currently suffers from hearing loss, but she does not let this impediment keep her from working and getting ahead.  Socorro has a small business in her home where she sells fish and soft drinks.  She is requesting a loan to buy more products because she is out of inventory and does not have sufficient funds to acquire more.  The earnings she generates are used to cover her household expenses and her grandson\u2019s education.  She prays to God in hopes that she will see her grandson grow up and have a good education.  Socorro knows that this will be difficult since she is 70 years old.  She is grateful to God for life and the people who have entrusted individuals like her with these loans.

He is extremely happy to have such a productive land. He also has a few cows, chickens, pigs ,and ducks, but arecomplimentary sources of income. He makes ends meet with the profits he makes from rice production. In his home he lives with his wife, kids, some grandchildren and his mother. He will invest the loan in preparing his lands and in fertilizer. He hopes with the investments he will have more productivity from the land and to fix the roof of his home. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T21:38:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Misael Albino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T00:14:28Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21411},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T19:36:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31797},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:29:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51898},{"amount":513,"local_amount":513,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:47:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":513,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107755}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T00:14:28Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:47:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12157,"name":"Phau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phau P. is 36 years old, married and a mother of 3 children.

All the life lessons that she received in her home have  taught her to practice efficient labor in the fields of cultivation, dedicating herself to sowing potatoes, corn, and vegetables. She also raises cows and grows alfalfa for them year after year. Thanks to this activity she can satisfactorily meet the needs of her family and be a very important leader in the maintenance of her home, along with her husband who also aids her in these activities. Although last year she lost her entire harvest and earnings when an unending winter force fell over her fields, this did not discourage her and she continues forward by having planned to grow spinach and carrots this year during the wait period for the potato and corn harvests. Domitilia does all these activities for her three children who motivate her to continue forward with her longings to offer them the best so that they can achieve higher education. For this reason she is requesting a loan for this growing season to buy seeds and fertilizer and also improve her little cattle stable. All this and each of these earnings will be for the benefit and education of her children. Let's support Domitila in her noble mission to prepare her children for the life ahead of them.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva volunteer <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDomitila, desde muy  ni\u00f1a ha estado siempre ligada a las actividades agr\u00edcolas ya que proviene de una familia netamente agr\u00edcola y ganadera,  todas las  lecciones de vida que recibi\u00f3 en su hogar han hecho que ella ejerza de una manera eficiente su labor  en sus campos de cultivo, dedic\u00e1ndose a sembrar papa, ma\u00edz y verduras, as\u00ed mismo  cr\u00eda vacas y para ellas cultiva la alfalfa, a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o. Gracias a esta actividad  puede solventar satisfactoriamente las necesidades de su familia y ser una protagonista muy importante  en la manutenci\u00f3n de su hogar,  junto a su esposo que ahora tambi\u00e9n la apoya en estas actividades.A pesar de que el a\u00f1o pasado perdi\u00f3 totalmente su cosecha y ganancias cuando cay\u00f3 sobre sus campos de cultivo la implacable fuerza del invierno, esto no la desanim\u00f3 y sigue adelante y ha planeado para este a\u00f1o  sembrar espinacas y zanahorias durante el tiempo de  espera de la cosecha de papa y ma\u00edz. Todas estas actividades, Domitila, las realiza por el bien de sus tres hijos que la motivan a seguir adelante con sus anhelos a fin de ofrecerles lo mejor para que lleguen a superarse estudiando.Es por ello que para esta \u00e9poca de siembra solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con el prop\u00f3sito de comprar semillas y abonos y tambi\u00e9n para mejorar su peque\u00f1o establo de vacas, as\u00ed mismo todas y cada una de estas ganancias ser\u00e1n en beneficio y para la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.Apoyemos a Domitila en su noble misi\u00f3n de preparar a sus hijos para la vida."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":85050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds, fertilizer, and improvements for the stalls in her little stable.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-20T19:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T23:01:24Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":109718},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-05T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128960},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-05T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":150095},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174507},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-05-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":263.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201734},{"amount":85,"local_amount":242.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-05T09:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":254.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":228940}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T23:01:24Z","paid_date":"2008-06-05T09:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28542,"name":"Sununa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sununa is married with 8 children and also cares for 10 orphans.

Her daily income from this is about 100,000VND (6.25USD). Since joining the Fund, the income from this business has been higher. Besides the store, she also invests in rearing pigs. This is also the main source of income for her family, as every year she can sell 3 rounds of pigs, each round 3 tonnes, yielding a profit of about 35,000,000VND (2187.50USD). This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to continue investing in rearing pigs.

She doesn't mind it because thanks to this business she has been able to meet other people in her community and form bonds of friendship with her neighbors. She longs to eventually have a shop, since she can't sell her large quantity of products comfortably because she doesn't have an appropriate place for them. But by setting up a shop in her home, she could increase her sales and generate more income. Cosmetic sales are very profitable because style and fashion appeal to women young and old in her town. She has been working with MFP PRISMA for several years, and this is her seventh loan. They have helped her improve her business, and the group provides her with a place to socialize. The money she has requested is to purchase a display case in which to display her products, which will cost 2500 soles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":274455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy a display case for her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-19T23:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":369.12},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":392.8},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":404.57},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":427.46},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":443.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":462.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.77},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.51},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":114.43,"local_amount":369.12,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":372.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423782},{"amount":121.77,"local_amount":392.8,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":396.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117119},{"amount":125.41,"local_amount":404.57,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":408.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012032},{"amount":132.51,"local_amount":427.46,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":431.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595618},{"amount":280.88,"local_amount":906.05,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":914.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989879}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T01:32:33Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":94101,"name":"Menglikul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 37 \u043b\u0435\u0442 , \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439, \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u0435 \u0423\u0442\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u044f \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u0430.\u0421\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b , \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f.\u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.\u0414\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u041c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442.

She is 61 years old. Salama is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Salama owns and operates a transportation services business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating jeepney transport services (a popular means of public transportation in the Philippines). Salama has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 8,400 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Salama joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Salama is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to repair existing vehicles for better service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Salama from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

And sales are made door-to-door and at the market, generally in cash transactions with customers composed of women and men.  \r\n\r\nThe group members each envision making an average monthly profit of 15,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to build up their capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":489559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying food items ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T01:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75227.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991377},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":75227.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021658},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":75227.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746447},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":75227.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778984}],"funded_date":"2010-02-17T06:08:56Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":180837,"name":"Meriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meriam, 57, is grateful to be tilling her own farm because other farmers at her town only tend other people\u2019s farm to earn a living.

They have four children who are between 11 and 22 years old. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, with which she intends to buy corn and rice to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nErlinda P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 44 years old. Caridad is married with five school-aged children. She owns and operates a business venture raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from growing and selling a variety of vegetables. Caridad has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Caridad joined ASKI to gain access to financial services. Caridad has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Caridad is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young plants to raise. This loan will be her fourth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a 24-year-old son that she happily lives with and dreams of seeing him being happy and very successful.  She started her business 8 years ago selling lunches among her neighbors until the boss at a nearby firm tasted \u201cthe deliciousness of her seasoning\u201d and gave her the contract for his firm.  Since then, sales have increased and she projects daily growth toward other markets.\r\n\r\nHowever, insufficient working capital is her great challenge to attain this growth.  This is why she\u2019s calling on her Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s done with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy raw materials like rice, oil and foodstuffs in order to have a larger stock of inventory.

She is a very hardworking woman who is determined to get ahead with her children and help her partner, who works as labourer earning $50 a week. However, this is not enough money to cover the basic needs of the family. Deysi raises Indian hens (type of chicken) and fattens pigs. These are sold when there is an emergency or need. She sells 100% of her hens in December and obtains a good profit. \r\n\r\nDeysi does this work very well as she has been doing this since she was a girl.

In this way she can contribute to the household as well as not neglect her children.\r\n\r\nShe buys on credit in the city some of the materials she uses to raise her animals. She has the advantage that her partner, as well as working as a labourer, plants corn which she uses to feed her animals. They are a determined couple who mutually help each other. She provides him wiith money from the sale of the hens and chickens when he needs to buy manure and he helps her by providing corn. \r\n\r\nDeysi is asking the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for this loan to buy: 5 pigs, 3 sacks of concentrates for the pigs, 2 quintals (1 quintal equals 100lbs) of concentrate for the hens, 2 pounds of nails, 8 sheets and 4 timber scantlings to make a covering so the pigs are shaded. \r\n\r\nThe loan will help her obtain a better income which will allow her to give her 3 children an eductaion, as the 2 eldest were unable to continue with their studies due to economic reasons.

She has a teenage daughter, who she raised all by herself. Vera lives in Ivano-Frankivsk. She is engaged in retail trade in perfumes, cosmetics and hygiene products. She has as many as three sales points around the city, six employees, and a separate warehouse for the goods. In the past, Vera worked as an English teacher. After her husband's passing she had to take over his business. Vera set relatively low prices for the whole range of products; her vending stalls are conveniently located throughout the city. She has been in this business for twenty years. Vera plans to invest the Kiva loan of 20 000 hryvnas in the purchase of perfumes. She would like to increase the assortment before the holidays. She will buy perfumes, eau-de-cologne,  hair dyes, etc. in order to meet the increasing demand before the New Year and Christmas holidays. Vera's goal is to finance her daughter's college education.\r\n\r\nNote: original text in
