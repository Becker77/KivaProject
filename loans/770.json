Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Currently all her children attend school. She sells smoked fish and started her fish selling business 20 years ago at the community market where she lives. She buys her stock of fish from Yeji in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana and sells them from a table stand and sometimes through hawking. She prepares and serves her customers with a very tasty and good quality fish and because of that many customers buy from her stand. She has a high customer base.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting   variety of vegetables for sale.  Leiua has many years of experience in this business.  Leiua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leiua joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Leiua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leiua L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.23 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.66 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Felipa is a woman who has been working hard since her youth.  She is 48 years old and has her own business.  Felipa sells tortillas and operates a grain mill in order to generate income.  She and her husband struggled to acquire their own home.  \r\n<p>\r\nFelipa started her small business because she needed to support her family since her husband receives low wages from his job as a security guard.  For this reason, she started making tortillas in order to attract many customers and later acquired a grain mill.  With her previous loan, she was able to repair the ceiling above her kitchen.  Felipa is happy with these loans because they have helped to improve her house.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan she will finish extending the ceilings of the other rooms since they are very low.  This will provide greater privacy.  She will also have the rooms painted and the roof above them repaired.

In the future, she would like to run a grocery store at home, build bathroom, and support her children to study until they get a Bachelor's degree. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":974559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice to resell when the price is higher.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Chnang province","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 104.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":9,"posted_date":"2012-01-05T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Channy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257236488},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:19:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263375772},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270089415},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276915834},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-20T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283897300},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288439103},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294391625},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:44:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301446349},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:24:06Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308206512},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315437354}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T21:24:28Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:17:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":382265,"name":"Faaolo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"Faaolo is forty five years old and is married.

She is earning low wages at the time of $1.50 (US) per day. Her husband is the primary breadwinner, earning $3 (US) per day as a taxi driver within the city of Kampong Cham. Business has been tough for all taxi drivers in recent days as the cost of gasoline is approaching $6 (US) per gallon. He has been a taxi driver since 1990 and knows his trade well. They have one child together but also care for two of Tek's younger sisters, one of whom works with her as a chef. As her meager earnings from her current job are not sufficient to support her family, she wants to take out a loan to buy fish to raise in ponds by her house.

She gets her supplies in towns surrounding Sikasso and then resells them retail and wholesale to customers composed generally of market vendors from other cities in the country and elsewhere (DAKAR) in the Republic of Senegal.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help with family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":263084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fruit (oranges)  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marietou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":74460.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440376},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":37230.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135755},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:38Z","rounded_local_amount":37230.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033556},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":37230.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620924},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":37230.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019889},{"amount":75,"local_amount":35714.26,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:19Z","rounded_local_amount":37230.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242639}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T16:50:10Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":90479,"name":"Tumejidhatiti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riziki J. has been a soup seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for 1 year. \r\nShe currently earns an average monthly profit of $35.

Pi\u00f1ipampa, which is about 40 minutes from the city. Apolinar is 37 years old, lives with his two children, and divides his time between farming and making artisan tiles. He learned to make tiles as a child, when he helped his father with the craft. Apolinar has requested a loan so that he can buy tile-making materials like clay and sand, rent ovens, and afford to transport his tiles to the city of Cusco. Apolinar appreciates this loan because there is no commercial banking available in his area. He has agreed to abide by all the terms of his loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":315533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying clay for tile-making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pi\u00f1ipampa - Andahuaylillas - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolinar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":184.63},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":192.01},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":199.69},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":207.68},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":215.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.2},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107.66,"local_amount":307.6,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":322.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918327},{"amount":57.08,"local_amount":163.09,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:32Z","rounded_local_amount":170.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139166},{"amount":59.36,"local_amount":169.61,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":177.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564785},{"amount":61.74,"local_amount":176.39,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:09:17Z","rounded_local_amount":184.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998358},{"amount":64.16,"local_amount":183.31,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":192.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910825}],"funded_date":"2009-06-06T02:58:22Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:41:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":110959,"name":"Aya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aya H. is currently in the business of selling hair essentials at her beauty salon and is requesting a loan to increase the stock in her shop.

She has just finished repaying her previous loan with the cooperative, so she has applied for a new loan in the amount of 14,000 PHP to use as additional capital for the continuous growth of her business. She will restock on nonperishable grocery items and rice to sell at her store.\r\n<p>\r\nMaricar wishes to see her store grow into a mini-mart or a supermarket someday.

She lives in the area called El Carmen de Guzha, which is about 15 minutes away from the city of Cuenca, with her children ranging in age from 2 to 13 years.  Her oldest child is not in school and preferred to pursue a job working at a brass works shop.  The other school-age children attend classes at Aurelio Ochoa Elementary, while the baby is enrolled in day care.  As a result of her work, Mar\u00eda Alicia has managed to build her own home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe joined the Communal Bank upon the recommendation of a friend who told her about how it easy it was to obtain loans and make repayments.  Mar\u00eda Alicia has been selling fruit for fifteen years.  She does not have an established place for selling her goods, so she travels through the market offering her products every day without resting.  Mar\u00eda Alicia tells us that the loans have helped her increase her business and will use this new loan to buy more fruits such as papaya, watermelon, honeydews, bananas, apples, mangos, and other products to increase her assortment of stock to offer her to her customers, thereby generating more business.

She continues the family tradition by selling produce on Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  She is devoted to farming during the rest of the week.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, Margarita will buy tomatoes, onions, peas, carrots, and other vegetables.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Asiasiga has many years of experience in this business.  Asiasiga needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 155 talas or US $65 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Asiasiga joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Asiasiga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This group consists of very responsible and hard-working women who make a living producing food to later sell. Every member has a specific job related to food production. The women work together responsibly and with solidarity, and they consider helping each other out to be very commendable. Each one works for a dignified life, not only for themselves but also for their families. One of the members is Regina, who has made food to sell for a number of years and already has a solid customer base. The women are requesting the loan to purchase the necessary ingredients to make their meals, such as meat, chicken, eggs and other items. All of them have their hopes resting on the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":801957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

(Lake Victoria is famous not only for being one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.)\r\n<p>\r\nMariamu is single, with one child who is 7 years old. She has been running a used clothing store since 2007.  Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe. They are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything modern. \r\n<p>\r\nMariamu works at her business for  9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. She currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase additional used clothing for resale. Mariamu thanks you for supporting her business!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional used clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariamu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970760},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886977},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436237},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130509},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027306},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613325},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010408},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232719},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664535},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105266}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T05:13:11Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78207,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes O. sells bags of garri in wholesale and retail.

is married with six children. Her husband works as a timekeeper in Hacienda, which earns him a low monthly salary that barely supports the needs of their family.  Although some of her children are already adults and can fend for themselves, she has younger children (the youngest being just 9 years old) who still depend on her for all their needs. Amalia's ambition in life is to be able to send her children to school and to help her husband support their family. <p>\r\n\r\nFor this reason, she decided to set up a general store.  Fortunately, she had the foresight to build it in an area where there is a steady flow of pedestrian traffic -- right in front of the tricycle terminal.  As time went on, her business steadily improved.  Moreover, she used her business skills to continuously improve and enlarge her product lines, such as by stocking up on fast-selling products for a high inventory turnover rate. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2005, when she realized that she needed fresh capital in order to take her store to the next level, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon.  By doing so, she was able to borrow much-needed capital to continue her business expansion.  And, as she has continued to pay back and borrow new loans, she is happy that her membership with NWTF-PD hsa allowed her to sustain her business momentum.  In fact, her business now earns her a net profit of PHP 3,000, which puts her that much closer to meeting her family's dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 7,500 for her 7th cycle loan, which she used as working capital for her general store.  Notably, she paid her weekly installment payment in full and in a timely manner, without any delays.  For her 8th cycle she is seeking to borrow PHP 15,000 to be used (again) as additional capital.  More specifically, she hopes to maximize her income potential with this loan, especially now that the sugar milling season has started once again, thereby opening a new opportunity to sell more goods to the community. She intends to use the income generated from her business to support her family's needs. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of thousands of women.  Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 per day to achieving success beyond their wildest imaginations.  They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable women.  This is Project Dungganon.

Palanitina needs a loan of WST $1100 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 140 tala or US $58 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Palanitina joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Palanitina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Palanitina S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She and her husband raised 4 children. Ten years ago, Mohira learned how to embroider the national skull-cap for men and women, and now she run her own business. She works really hard, getting up very early and going to bed very late, selling the skull-caps at the local market. Mohira dreams of arranging the marriage of her son. With this purpose in mind, Mohira is planning to expand her business. She is requesting a loan of $800 USD. Mohira is planning to spend the loan on purchasing materials for embroidering. Mohira had shown herself to be a reliable client of IMON. Let\u2019s get behind this dedicated mother to make her dream become reality.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nLast year, Merlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC, and is now applying for a new one for 7,000 PHP to buy additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by this loan to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives in his own home with his wife Valvina, age 32, and their three beloved children for whom he wants to provide a better quality of life.  Twenty years ago, N\u00e9stor received the support of his wife and decided to buy some land so that he could work and improve his family\u2019s financial situation.  He continues to work on the land, but now he is much more productive.  His crops of potatoes, peas, and corn are of very good quality, and over time, he has learned how to obtain a better production rate at harvest time.  What he enjoys most is the close relationship he has with the land.  He likes watching his crops grow.  On the other hand, N\u00e9stor finds it difficult to care for his fields whenever inclement weather is present since any type of neglect can affect the harvest.

What she doesn't like about her work is that she has to go by herself, and be away from her children for days at a time.  However, what she likes is that she earns a good amount of money and there are also times when she can spend whole days with her children.  \r\n\r\nA little while ago, she decided to pursue a new idea, that of going to a place, some distance from the city, where her relatives have convinced her that she can extract gold through artisanal means.  So she is hoping to enter this business in the next few weeks. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan between Sonia and MFP. She is happy, and and thankful that they will give her a loan with less paperwork, and especially because they will teach her how she can use her money in the best way. With the loan of 1500 soles that she is applying for, she will buy materials needed to extract gold."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":842287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Quarrying","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for her new activity of artisanal gold extraction","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-22T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":230.43},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":233.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":244.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":251.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":266.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":273.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.8},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.22},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1506.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350858}],"funded_date":"2011-08-24T10:52:17Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":329001,"name":"Dorah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorah lives in Uganda.

She has been working in sales for the past 12 years. At the beginning she was in the business of selling eggs.  She became a client of MicroInvest back in 2003. After receiving her loan she proceeded to increase turnover, but because the number of people selling eggs increased, she chose to take her business in a different direction.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has worked day to day, breeding cattle and sheep for several years, but a year ago she started a pig farm that she periodically sells in the livestock fair in her region.  In order to have good earnings, her animals have to have a good weight.  This is achieved through good nutrition, for which she grazes her animals every morning at a distance of 3 hours by foot from her home.  She returns in the afternoon.  For Doris, this activity is usually a distraction because she goes to the countryside to breathe fresh air, and she is accustomed to this routine.  For the future, she hopes to increase the quantity of animals in order to have more working capital.  This is the second time that Doris has had a loan with MFP.  She is very determined to continue working for the well-being of her family and also of the other members of her community bank.

Filifili is now requesting a new loan of 1700 WST which will be used for the same reason.  The loan will be her fifth from SPBD.  Filifili plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

D. C. is an active woman who lives in the neighborhood of Buenos Aires.  She enjoys Carnival season, the time of year when a picturesque atmosphere sets the background for the most important cultural festival in the city.  The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barranquilla_Carnival\" target=\"_blank\" >Carnival of Barranquilla<\/a> is also one of the happiest occasions in Colombia.  Its popular and carefree style reflects the youthful spirit and creativity of the people of Barranquilla, making it an essential part of the Caribbean.\r\n<p>  \r\nOnce the Christmas holidays are over, Elva Mar\u00eda and her daughter begin organizing her home business with all the decorations pertaining to Carnival, a mixture of the modern with the more traditional type that reflects the event\u2019s origins.  The tradition of Carnival was brought to the Americas from Spain and continues to promote the spirit of renewal and change that inspired this holiday season in Europe.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to being known for her cheerful personality, Elva Mar\u00eda is an enterprising woman who prepares snacks such as fried foods maD. of flour, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a> (flatbread served with various fillings or toppings), and cariba\u00f1olas (dumplings maD. of cassava and potato dough, stuffed with meat and vegetables).  She sells these snacks to stores and individually to neighbors in her area.  Elva Mar\u00eda also has a retail shop in her home that is stocked with stationery and various seasonal accessories worn by women and girls.\r\n<p>\r\nHer snack business was a tradition passed on to her by her mother, who also prepared these same products for sale.  Elva Mar\u00eda has added the most delicious desserts to her offerings, as she loves the art of cooking.  She also sells <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sancocho\" target=\"_blank\" >sancocho<\/a> (a traditional soup), but she noticed that many people in the neighborhood started prospering, so she suspended selling food temporarily so that she could open and organize the retail shop in her home.  When this business started, her husband Joaquin C. traveled frequently for work since he was employed by a shipping company.  Running a home business helped to make her feel that she was not alone.  Today, her husband is retired and enjoys a peaceful and happy life.\r\n<p>\r\nElva Mar\u00eda has received three previous loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has repaid them all on time.  She used the proceeds to purchase miscellaneous goods and supplies for preparing food at different times of the year:  Christmas, Carnival season, Easter, etc.  With the profits generated by her business, she has managed to make repairs and modifications to her home because her husband\u2019s pension was used to pay for the completion of the work.  This freed up her income to devote on other expenses such as food and services.  Their joint incomes have also contributed to the success of her business.  Her next loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP will be used to stock her store with school supplies.  She also plans to sell drinks, such as delicious and healthy juices, and popsicles maD. with milk and fruit and packed in plastic bags.  Her customers will soon be able to taste these delightful treats in order to cool down from the high temperatures experienced on the Coast.\r\n<p>\r\nElva Mar\u00eda\u2019s goal for her family in the midterm is to acquire a place at a commercial site so that she can use her home for storing the display cases that hold the merchandise displayed before customers.  Her short-term goal is to buy a hot dog cart with a canopy; a bread and sausage steamer; inserts with lids for keeping onions, cheese, and potatoes; stainless steel containers for holding sauces; and an interior cupboard for storing bread.   These items will be installed at the entrance of her business, which is already known for selling food and hosting the most anticipated costume party for the residents of the neighborhood, the famous \u201cLunes D. Carnaval\u201d that occurs on the third day of Carnival season.   The party starts with the appearance of a large pick-up truck equipped with a sound box, six loudspeakers, two columns, three machines, eight transistors, an equalizer, and a three CD disk changer.  The group \u201cEl Millo\u201d begins the festivities with traditional Caribbean folk music.  In this district of Barranquilla, this annual neighborhood tradition is now known as \u201cthe Party with the Cuetos\u201d, named after Elva Mar\u00eda\u2019s family.  The attendees of this great rumba festival only pay for the food and beverages offered by Elva Mar\u00eda, so she is able to enjoy the party and still earn a little money.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

He also earns income from running a small barbershop in his town. Wycliffe currently employs two other men to assist him on his farm and he says that his main challenges now are the unpredictable climate and high prices of drugs for his tomato crops.\r\n\r\nWycliffe has completed two previous loans with Juhudi Kilimo for Kes 25,000 and Kes. 40,000 and has now requested this loan for Kes. 80,000 to purchase a posho mill. A posho mill is a machine that grinds maize for easier consumption and packaging for sale. He says that the extra income from this loan will help him cover all of his children's school fees throughout their education. In the future, Wycliffe wants to become a large-scale dealer in tomatoes, buying produce from other surrounding farms and becoming a main supplier to the local markets.\r\n\r\nWycliffe said that

She is married and has two children, aged 4 and 1. In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy seeds and fertilizers for her farm. In the future, Tara plans to raise the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70 percent of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

This group is located in a batey (a sugarcane company town) in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy and most of the people are Haitian immigrants. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water (none of which is potable). \r\n\r\nHe is excited to be taking out his third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and grown his business. Renold plans to use this loan to invest in his business by buying rice, beans, sugar, canned food, vegetables, etc., He is running a colmado, a small grocery store. \r\n\r\nRenold makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and three children.

Evalyn has been an active member of Life in Africa since 2005.

She has three children and she lives in the Acholi quarter which is a camp for displaced persons from the north. <p>She and her family were forced to flee their home in the north because of the war. They settled in the camp as did most Acholis who fled to Kampala and she earned what little money she could by selling bananas. She would tie her baby on her back, carry a basket of bananas on her head, and she would walk all day trying to sell enough to make ends meet. She barely earned enough to pay the rent and feed them so school was just not possible. Since coming to LiA, their lives have greatly improved. Now she has no problem paying the rent, her children are not hungry and they even go to school.<\/p> <p>The King of Buganda has great sympathy for the Acholi and has donated land to them. She has acquired a plot of this land and she now wishes to build a two roomed house for her family that will be permanent and safe. For this she is seeking a loan in the amount of 600,000.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

All of these items are very expensive.  \r\n\r\nNow, Gina has requested 35,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business.

With the support of KIVA lenders, Gina hopes to improve the standard of living for herself and her family and lift them out of poverty. \r\n \r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her food in order to earn a much larger income.

Con el apoyo de este prestamo podra mantener la misma afluencia de clientes que visitan su pulperia porque tendra lo que ellos necesitan comprar para su hogar.

Her husband helps her tend to the store while she takes care of household chores.  She is open for business from 6am until 9pm.  Her greatest advantage is that her grocery store is the best stocked in the entire neighborhood and this leads to her having a large customer base.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan she requested to better stock the store with a larger variety of items that form a family\u2019s basic grocery cart.  Support from the loan will make it possible for her to retain her customers that visit her store because she\u2019ll have everything they need to buy for their homes.\r\n\r\nHer challenge is reaching a point of economic stability that will permit her to start saving in order to buy a house because she is currently renting.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to become a mother so she plans to adopt two small children and continue to work every day to support them and give them good living conditions.\r\n\r\nShe has been a FEMA client for two cycles and has shown punctuality and responsibility in her repayments and expects to continue to do so.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":686585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy assorted groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-01-06T17:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia Danubia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414832},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833448},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-05T08:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275994},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-02T08:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206143306},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216249},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8817.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494631}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T20:48:35Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":267556,"name":"Ahmed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmed is a young man from Bethlehem, he shares taking care of the household expenses and his 6 members family with his sisters and brothers.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She chose this business since her village is quite isolated from urban areas, therefore, the villagers have hard time obtaining daily household needs.  She sells daily needs like rice, spices, soap and various snacks.  \r\n\r\nShe opens her kiosk at 7 am and closes it at 6om.  She earns about $4 each day.  As her business grow, her clients are requesting that she carries more merchandise, such as kerosene and farm feeds. Ni Nengah Juni Astuti wants to fulfill these requests and grow her business.  Hoerver she does not have sufficient capital.  So she applied for a $330 loan from DINARI. With this additional funding, Ni Nengah Juni Astuti plans to increase her merchandise offering and renovate her kiosk.  She is optimistic that her business will grow significantly.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nSetelah menikah dengan Putu Purnawa 4 tahun yang lalu, Ni Nengah Juni Astuti    mulai membuka warung kecil di depan rumahnya.Usaha ini dipilih Ni Nengah Juni Astuti karena di dusun tempat tinggalnya, merupakan salah satu dusun yang sangat terpencil yang jauh dari perkotaan sehingga masyarakat di tempat ini sangat sulit untuk membeli barang- barang kebutuhan sehari-hari. Barang yang dijual adalah segala kebutuhan rumah tangga seperti beras, bumbu dapur, deterjen, sabun mandi dan aneka makanan kecil.\r\n           Mulai pukul 07.00 pagi Ni Nengah Juni Astuti membuka warungnya dan tutup pada pukul 18.00 sore. Keuntungan rata rata yang di peroleh per harinya sebesar Rp. 35.000.- Seiring dengan perkembangan dan juga banyaknya permintaan dari pelanggan akan keperluan yang lain seperti minyak tanah dan pakan ternak khususnya ternak babi , Ni Nengah Juni Astuti bermaksud mengembangkan lagi usaha warungnya. Namun karena dana yang di miliki tidak cukup, Ni Nengah juni Astuti mencari pinjaman ke Dinari sebesar Rp 3.000.000,- .Dengan tambahan modal ini Ni Nengah Juni Astuti akan menambah barang daganganya dan memperbaiki kondisi warungnya agar lebih baik lagi. Ni Nengah Juni Astuti optimis usahanya akan berkembang
