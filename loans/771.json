Aminata D. is 47 years old and lives with her eight children and her husband in a monogamous family in the Pelengana quarter, south of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth largest economic region in Mali). In the beginning she used to send her servants out to search for firewood for her own personal use, but when her neighbors saw the bundles of wood, they would always come and ask her to sell them some of it. Therefore, she decided to get involved in the firewood business and has been involved in it for 13 years. She makes all her sales at home, for cash or credit to her customers, who are mainly comprised of women as well as bakers. She sells firewood year-round. After having taken out five group loans, she is on her second individual loan and all previous loans were correctly repaid. With this loan she hopes to buy 20 loads of firewood from the surrounding villages of S\u00e9gou from farmers who are legally established in the firewood business, and she hopes to make a monthly profit of 12,000 FCFA (about $29), which she hopes to reinvest into her business.\r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nMadame Aminata D. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 47ans et vit avec ses 8 enfants et son mari dans une famille monogame dans le quartier Pelengana sud de la ville de S\u00e9gou (quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique de la r\u00e9publique du Mali). \r\nAu d\u00e9but elle envoyait ses domestiques chercher du bois de chauffe pour usage personnel, ses voisins voyant les tas de fagots, venaient toujours lui demander de leur en vendre une partie.

S. is 28 and lives with her parents and three-year-old son in Uvurhanghay, one of Mongolia's southern provinces. Her parents receive a government pension, but her mother has been ill lately. Although Tserenbyamba has her own one-bedroom apartment in town, she has rented it out to pay for medicine for her sick mother. \r\n\r\nAfter she graduated from university in 2001, Tserenbyamba started a small retail business selling women and men's clothing. Early that year, she opened a small stall in the local market, and in December 2008, she rented another stall in a new shopping center that just opened. She usually buys clothing from the wholesale markets in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. She hopes she can afford all the medicine her mother needs, and would eventually like to open her own clothing shop. Tserenbyamba is applying for this loan to buy more clothing from Ulaanbaatar to sell to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":318013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene para encargarse de su negocio y ser su propio jefe. Lleva 5 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda bajo el inclemente sol, ya que esto lo cansa mucho. Para un futuro cercano, Carlos espera tener una tienda donde pueda vender bicicletas nuevas, ya que actualmente se dedica a vender las bicicletas que arregla. Este es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y espera tener la misma puntualidad que tuvo en sus dos primeros cr\u00e9ditos. En su banco comunal es un socio muy responsable y solidario. Con los seiscientos nuevos soles solicitados planea comprar m\u00e1s bicicletas para arreglarlas y as\u00ed incrementar la cantidad que vende.","en":"Carlos is an easy-going and responsible person. His is forty-five years old and lives in a house that he inherited from his parents. He lives with is wife Carmen, 45 years old, to whom he desires to provide a better life. With a lot of drive to succeed, Carlos begins his days at his business selling bicycles at the \u201cEsplanada Laguna\u201d. It is a temporary location in the city of Juliaca where they have fairs. He is a very able salesperson. He always convinces his customers to buy bicycles. What he likes the best about his business is the freedom to be own boss. He has been in business for five years. He finds that the most difficult part of his business is to remain all day in the sun as it tires you out a lot. In the near future, Carlos hopes to have a store where he can sell new bicycles or bicycles that he fixes up. This is his fifth loan with MFP and he hopes to have the same punctuality that he had with the first two loans. He is a responsible and joint member of the communal bank. With the 600 soles he has requested, he will buy more bicycles to fix up and increase the number that he sells. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":347147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase his inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211962},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641490},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080929},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997071},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842413},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842414}],"funded_date":"2009-07-04T19:48:36Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":124091,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 53 years old.

They call their group Salapateh. They are local entrepreneurs in Waterloo small-town, about 22 miles from Freetown. This is the first loan this group of entrepreneurs is accessing from SMT, a partner of Shine on Sierra Leone. With the help of a loan of LE 500,000 for each entrepreneur, they will be able to expand their businesses, make better profits and consequently improve the status and quality of their businesses.\r\n\r\nIsatu K. (right and attached below left) is the leader of the group. She is 23 years old. She was born in a village called Masinra, in northern Sierra Leone. Isatu is a widow with one child who is four years old. Isatu sells palm-oil (the most popular cooking oil), bananas, plantains, cucumbers, pineapples, and any other items she discovers to be in high demand in the market. With this loan, Isatu will buy gallons of palm-oil. Five gallons make a \u201cbarter\u201d and a barter of palm-oil costs her LE 60,000, which she sells at LE 65,000 - 70,000.

The family survived for years on her husband\u2019s work as a plumber and Tonya\u2019s career as a corporate executive assistant.\r\n\r\nAfter suffering through a severe illness for a few years, Tonya was laid off from her job in 2008. Throughout Tonya\u2019s illness and recovery, Ted was by her side to take care of her. He cut back his hours working as a plumber and eventually the family filed for bankruptcy as medical bills stacked up. \u201cWhen all was said and done, we\u2019d lost our home, lost everything and had to start over.\u201d \r\n\r\nTonya is now healthy and grateful for a new chance at life. She works side-by-side with her husband at Plumbwerx Plumbing, their family-run business. It\u2019s a full service plumbing company specializing in all phases of residential and commercial plumbing, with one of their niches being tankless water heaters, an eco-friendly product that saves consumers money, energy and provides continuous hot water!\r\n\r\n\u201cMost people aren\u2019t expecting to see a woman running a plumbing business when they come into the office,\u201d said Tonya. But it\u2019s clear she runs a tight ship and she puts her background as a corporate executive assistant to good use, deftly managing the accounting, marketing, sales, inventory, and dispatching her husband and team on jobs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI get calls everyday from referral partners who want us to provide all types of plumbing services but I have to turn them down because we don\u2019t have the manpower to meet demand,\u201d said Tonya.

It provided her with an opportunity of accessing start-up capital for income-generating activities. With her first loan from ASHI, she carefully invested in her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). She uses the profits for daily expenses.\r\n<br>Now on her third loan, Josefina is requesting 15,000 PHP to create a broader business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase additional supplies for her sari-sari store, such as cases of beers, soft drinks, and other stocks. She is very determined and disciplined in her use of the loan.\r\n<br>Josefina still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her grandchildren and to have a happy family. During the course of her membership in ASHI, she has shown herself to be industrious and determined to make her dreams come true.\r\n<br>Josefina is a 54-year-old business-minded woman. Her husband passed away so she is now the single mother of her daughter, Janett. She lives in Pililia, in the province of Rizal, Philippines.

Since the microcredit ASHI is extending to these women is delivered directly in their villages on the doorsteps of their houses, they are given the hope that someday they will \u201crise above

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is 44 years old. Estilita is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEstilita is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Estilita owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Estilita has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Estilita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Estilita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Estilita is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Estilita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is from a very small and peaceful village, filled with vegetation. There is a monarch butterfly sanctuary close by which attracts tourism from within Mexico and abroad. Leti is part of the Una Nueva Vida [\"A New Life\"] communal bank. She says that they chose this name because all the group members have improved their living conditions through their loans. With obvious affection for her parents, Leti tells us that she did not continue with her studies because her parents did not have enough money to keep supporting her.\r\nShe has had her own business for two years, selling popsicles and ice cream. Her sales are lower in the wintertime, so she sells bread. Her mother-in-law bakes the bread, and she buys it to later sell in the neighbouring towns. She tells us that she is requesting a loan for the purchase of a refrigerator, since hers is broken down and she does not have enough money to have it repaired. She would like to buy a new one because her current fridge has already eaten up a lot of money, so it makes more sense to buy a new one. \r\nUpon receiving this loan, she says she will also buy bread to sell so that she can continue supporting her husband with the household costs. They have four children: Ana Karen, age 17, in high school; Beatriz, age 14, in middle school; and Alma Cristina and Bernardo, both 11, in elementary school.\r\nLeti says that this loan will benefit her because she will have a new fridge to keep her popsicles in good shape, and she won't spend as much money on electricity. She says that one of her goals is to open a special store for her popsicles and for selling her mother-in-law's bread. She is grateful to all of the people who make these loans possible, since they help so many people to have prosperous businesses.\r\nThe other group members are Mar\u00eda Magdalena, Ma Victoria, Efra\u00edn and Petra.

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

She sold them at a local market on Fifth Avenue in Comayaguela, but she lost her entire business due to a fire on July 30th.  Everything was completely reduced to ashes and the loss was approximately $3,750.  She is requesting a loan to restart her business since she doesn't have capital to reinvest in more products.  The mayor of Tegucigalpa is going to help rebuild the wooden market stalls, but if this doesn't happen, she is going to become a travelling salesperson in the meantime.  She lives with her husband who works as a security guard at a private business.  Her earnings help provide food and education for her two daughters.  It was very sad talking with Mayra because she is in low spirits after the loss of her business.  Her short-term goal is to start selling shoes again now that peak season is approaching. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amani Roland, Kiva

They farm seed potatoes, olluco (a root vegetable) and barley on leased and temporary (according to the rain) land. Among these, she prefers olluco and potato, which is why every year, she alternates the crops, while the barley is for family consumption. This work is done in partnership with her husband.

He is single and lives in his own house built from rustic wood, with a metal roof. With great care, he has managed to turn his land into a verdant place, surrounded by leafy trees and cocoa plants, coffee plants, and barbasco root.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this for 10 years, and also has the support of laborers.  He also mentions that when he was a small child he learned to work the land, thanks to the teachings of his parents, and now works on his own land.\r\n\r\nHis most profitable product is barbasco root, because he sells it to companies that use it to make insecticides and fungicides.\r\n\r\nThanks to the income he has earned, he has managed to buy more land and a mototaxi, which he uses to transport his products.\r\n\r\nIn the months of August through October, his main activity is planting all types of seeds; for this he has sought a loan to be able to carry out the planting of more barbasco seeds.  The plan he has in mind is to continue planting and buying more land so that he can overcome poverty.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan, and he is very happy to know that he will have financial support, as this way he will feel secure in going forward with his plans.  With the 2,500 nuevos soles, he will buy more barbasco seeds.\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":865711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy barbasco seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T05:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Duarte ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.31},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":177.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":192.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":194.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":201.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":212.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":216.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":225.68},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":231.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":242.28},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":248.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.6},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.65,"local_amount":388.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":391.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851285},{"amount":55.4,"local_amount":149.72,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":151.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621620},{"amount":69.57,"local_amount":188.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:19Z","rounded_local_amount":189.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835702},{"amount":73.31,"local_amount":198.13,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":199.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245463},{"amount":151.91,"local_amount":410.58,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":414.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098597},{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":216.71,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":218.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712816},{"amount":86.22,"local_amount":233.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201930},{"amount":88.19,"local_amount":238.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":240.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097705},{"amount":88.61,"local_amount":239.49,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":241.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400640},{"amount":87.96,"local_amount":237.72,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":239.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452406}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T06:38:47Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Bohnert","image":851467}},{"id":338049,"name":"Pleav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pleav, 46 years old, is a pig feeder who earns $5 per day.

She is dedicated to working hard to provide her house income for clothing, food, education and other things.\r\n\r\nMarie is excited to be taking her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing for women and kids and some pairs of shoes. She will use her business profits to save and build her house. She thanks you all for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":987528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GM Senablo of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs.

She lives in her own house with her husband Jos\u00e9 who is 32 years old.  He is always helping her and accompanies her on her everyday activities.  Her store is located in the Tupac Amaru Secondary School where it is frequented by the young people during recess, and they never hesitate to use the money which their parents have given them to buy the delicious baked treats that she sells at her stand.  Lourdes is very charismatic and cheerful and always treats the students with great affection.\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is to entertain herself with the children.  She's been doing this for three years and she thinks that what she likes least is having to remain at her stand all day long without being able to leave.  In the near future Lourdes hopes to have a grocery store which would allow her to increase her income and thus have a better life.  This is her sixth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and she is very satisfied with this new opportunity.  She knows that she has to make all of her payments on time in order not to do a disservice to the other members of her communal bank where she is very well liked.  The 9,000 Sols that she is requesting will be used to increase the inventory of  sweets and baked goods that she has in her store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":347190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733979}],"funded_date":"2009-07-07T17:31:47Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":124123,"name":"Omowumi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omowumi is very grateful to Kiva for their financial support.

She raises the guinea pigs, fattens them, and later sells them.  She has around 700 guinea pigs and they have reproduced and now she needs more food than ever for the babies.  She has a plot of land where she planted alfalfa (a vegetable that can serve as food for rodents and other animals).  She has always provided for her animals from this land but last week it rained very unexpectedly, and in 24 hours they got the equivalent of 1 month of rainfall.  Eleven regions of the city flooded, leaving behind a lot of damage.  This region was not as demolished, but it still suffered economic loss.

After her recovery, she got a job as an assistant at the Namaacha water company.  She has been a permanent employee there for more than 4 years, working from 7:00 am until 5:00 pm and earning 2,500 MZN monthly, but because of her husband's death she can no longer cover her expenses, since she lives in a rented house and pays 800 MZN per month.  She approached Hluvuku and Kiva to ask for a loan to purchase a title to some land and build a house on it.\r\n\r\nThis is Atalia's third loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva. The first, for 8,000 MZN, was used to purchase the title to her land, and the second loan of 12,000 MZN was to begin construction, which has been completed up to the roof beams.  These 15,000 MZN will be used to begin roofing the house, and soon she will be able to move in.  She is confident that she will pay ahead of time and ask for another loan to plaster the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Their livelihood from fishing is how Adita has been able to see her eldest child graduate from college and the needs of her four other children, aged 13 to 26, supported.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Adita and her husband decided to expand their fishing activities into a business. Adita joined Kiva's partner, ASHI, to gain access to financial support for their aspirations. Over time, their fishing business has been improving. They were able to purchase a fishing boat, which now has to be repaired after several years of use. \r\n\r\nFor this, Adita is requesting a much larger loan amount. She hopes that by reconditioning the engine and the boat itself, her husband will be able to catch more fish for her to sell directly to people in their village. She also wishes to put aside some savings for renovating their house and hopes to support her eldest child, who works for ASHI as a Development Officer. \r\n\r\nAdita\u2019s eldest child is her inspiration to work hard and support her youngest child's education, as her three other children have not finished their college education due to lack of financial

Ni\u00f1o. She is 43 years old. Jeannette is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Jeannette owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising ducks for sale. Jeannette has been engaged in her business for over 2 years. She also helps her husband maintain their rice farm. She also helps sell their harvest to the market.\r\n\r\nJeannette joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jeannette has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Jeannette is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future.

polygamous households. Their average age is 38, and most have two children. They live in the M\u00e9dine neighborhood of the city of Sikasso, in the third economic region of Mali. The group buys and sells wax-printed cloth (a favorite of Malian women) and food products (oils, bananas, eggs). This is their first foray into microfinance, and are collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso. The women of the Sindiya group want to use their loan to buy ten units of wax-printed cloth, a 25-liter drum of oil, ten sacks of yams, one hundred bunches of bananas, a supply of chicken eggs, etc. They purchase food products exclusively in the villages surrounding Sikasso, while they buy cloth and oil from wholesalers in the city market. They then sell their goods retail and wholesale in Sikasso, selling door-to-door and often on credit. The merchandise is sold from carts or from their stall in the M\u00e9dine marketplace. Their clientele includes members of all social levels. They foresee a profit of 20,000 CFA francs, which they will use in part to support their families and pay off the interest on the loan; they will reinvest the remainder in their business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Jonah Durning-Hammond, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLi\u00e9es par des liens de voisinage et des liens professionnels, les membres du groupe Sindiya sont des femmes mari\u00e9es vivant en g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans les foyers polygames avec en moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 38 ans, et 2 enfants.

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nAbout IMON International: \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population.

children. Mhamad has owned a grocery store for five years. He also sells vegetables.

Annah thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

They work together at Rosa's small restaurant, where she sells breakfast and lunch. Her sales have been slow lately, and she sometimes has to waste food when she can't sell it; she struggles each day to improve her economic situation. She lives in a neighborhood called South Waspan in the Nicaraguan capital city of Managua. Her goal is to finish the home improvements she has been making, little by little. She hasn't been able to do all of the construction at once because it would be very expensive. \r\n\r\nShe has been with Afodenic for three loan cycles now, and in this loan cycle she plans to buy meat, chicken, vegetables, fruits, basic grains, sodas, and other items to improve service at her restaurant and boost sales. She has already invested a lot of money in her business, and since she allows her clients to pay on credit, she needs the money up front in order to make this investment. She is grateful to Afodenic for the benefits she has obtained through loans; she has been able to make improvements to her business and in her personal life, and she is now better able to satisfy her own personal needs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva

She is married to Eliezer, a fisherman.\r\n\r\nShe joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap Inc.), a Kiva field partner in the Philippines, and the organization she have grown to love since 1995. ASHI helped her to start a business that helps her husband to pay for their daily expenditures. She and her husband had been in the fishing business for more than ten  years. \r\n\r\nFor her eighth loan, she is requesting Php 28,000.00 to continue her fishing business with the support of her husband. She will purchase assorted supplies for her fishing business, such as fishnet, rope, steel, bamboo, threads, and a fishing boat.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that, some day soon, she will have a larger space to store her fishing materials, a bigger fishing cage, and a stall in the market to sell her fish. She dreams also that she will be able to send her children to school and see them finish their studies. Gloria wants to thank ASHI for all its initiatives for the poor and thank the Kiva lenders who fund this loan. \r\n\r\nLike most families here in the Philippines, they want the best in life and a happy family. Now, she enjoys seeing how her ASHI loan changes their lives and gives them more opportunities to make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":458739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Three years ago, with the initial investment of 5000 soms, Odinahon and her husband began to breed livestock and sell it after fattening for a higher price. In this way, they make 4,000 soms per month. With money received from the loan, Odinahon wants to purchase sheep for breeding. In the future, she is planning to increase the number of livestock and save money to be able to pay for her children\u2019s education at the university.\r\n\r\nGulnara J. is the treasurer of the group. She is 35 and married. She has three daughters and a son and all of them study at school. Seven years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 soms, Gulnara and her husband started to breed cattle. By selling the cattle after fattening, they make 4,000 soms per month.  Gulnara applied for the loan because she wants to purchase a bull and resell it at a higher price after fattening. \r\n\r\nAlmazbek A., 29, is married. He has two sons and a daughter and all of them are preschool age (In Kyrgyzstan, children go to school when they are seven). Four years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 soms, Almazbek rented a place and started to sell convenience goods. He makes 4,000 soms per month.  With the money received from the loan, he wants to purchase foodstuffs to increase the turnover of his business. In the future, Almazbek plans to expand his business and wants to build a big house.\r\n\r\nUlpat K., 44, is married. She has two daughters and two sons. The older daughter and her Dad went to work in Russia to make some money, and the other children are students.  Six years ago, with the initial investment of 10,000 soms, Ulpat rented a place and started to sell convenience goods. She makes 8,000 soms per month. That profit made it possible for her to repair her house and pay for her children\u2019s education. Ulpat also breeds livestock and now the price for livestock is low.

She is 39 years old. Raquel is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Raquel owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal products like lotion, face powder, soap and others in the local community. Raquel has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Raquel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raquel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Raquel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the second loan taken out by Raquel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It requires exposure to the sun, the physical exertion of moving animals from one place to another, as well as the work it takes to tend to various crops. For the past 15 years, Iriskul has dedicated himself to breeding cattle, a business which supports his humble family. Currently, Iriskul has turned to IMON International for a loan of 10,000 TJS to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him but also his children and wife whom he loves greatly.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He studied pharmacology at a well-known local institute, but his hopes are all consolidated into his own business.  Four years ago he began farming.  Since that time, he has been working the land owned by his parents where he grows a variety of products:  peas, potatoes, and gladiolas on a large scale.  At the same time, he operates a small drugstore where he sells to the local villagers whenever they become ill.  Throughout this period he has done very well and was able to obtain his own car which he uses for providing public transportation.  Now he wants to take advantage of the good prices offered for agricultural products sold at the central market in the city of Tarma.  He also wants to improve the quality of his harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nWilfredo is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cPicaflores de Patay\u201d and receiving his fifth loan from MFP.  He is satisfied with the financial support and frequent seminars conducted to help him make progress.

She has been selling women's undergarments at a market for 4 years.  She started her business when she was a girl, prior to the marriage, and sold at the market with her mother.  When Sanavar got married, she stayed home for almost 2 years.  Her husband was against her selling at the market.  When he left to go work in Russia, Sanavar's mother helped with money.

And now on her 11th loan cycle, she has applied for a loan of P29, 000.00 as additional capital for her store. She dreams of having a larger grocery store some day.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.

Wilfredo has a small general store which he began with just a few items.  Despite not having much to offer his customers, he persevered.  With much patience he managed to increase the variety of his stock items and set up his store in his home.  His greatest difficulty is being able to stock everything his customers ask for.  The financing he is requesting will be used to buy toys, soft-drinks, juices, bread, and a little bit of clothing for children because the Christmas season is approaching and his customers buy his products because he offers them at reasonable prices.  His dream is that his business lasts and that his children run it some day.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":446237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-12-10T19:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":672.95,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":699.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118076059},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":660.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:55Z","rounded_local_amount":686.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123912065},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":692.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947921},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":692.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676183},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5541,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710551}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T19:17:08Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":165399,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma M. is from the village of Tipolo, Plaridel in Misamis Occidental.

With the new profits from her expanded business, Comfort plans to save to buy other equipment which will enable her to produce much palm kernel oil for sale.\r\n\r\nTo prepare her palm kernel oil she shells the palm nuts. The shelling used to be performed using two stones to crack each nut, separating the kernel and shell simultaneously. This manual operation has been largely superseded by the use of nut-cracking machines.\r\n\r\nThe traditional oil extraction method is to simply heat the dried nuts to release the palm kernel oil.

He lives with his wife and daughter in the Tsovagyugh village of the Syunik region.  Artur's daughter attends a secondary school. Artur breeds cattle, sheep and chickens.  He started to sell food and household products in a wagon-store nearby his home in 2005.  His wife does not work and helps Artur in the store and on the farm.  Thanks to their joint efforts, they are able to support their family and hope to continue developing their business in the future.  Artur is requesting a second loan from the Nor Horizon organization and now needs 500,000 dram to expand the assortment of his store and especially to buy a large inventory of cold drinks, grans, coffee, tea and also an inventory of soap, shampoos, etc. Thanks to the future profit, Artur hopes to buy a used car to deliver goods for his store, which would significantly reduce his business
