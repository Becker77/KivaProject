Estrelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. \r\n\r\nEstrelita is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.

The canoe was bringing in substantial income. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by a storm at sea; and so, this woman can now count on only selling fish to support herself and her family members. \r\n\r\nShe obtained two IMCEC loans of 200,000 francs CFA each, and she has repaid them completely and on time.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP700 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nGrace hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she hopes to send all of her children to college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God that she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She lives in the home of her deceased father in the Ni\u00e9bala neighborhood in Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Following her father's death, Ms. Rokiatou C. decided to start money-making businesses, notably to help her mother provide for the family expenses. For years, she had tried various businesses, all unsuccessful, mostly due to her low working capital. She finally chose to buy and sell clothes, shoes, perfumes, ... a business she learned from one sister. With four years of experience, she is now very good at her business, and she is in high demand.\r\nIn order to obtain a substantial working capital, Rokiatou C. decided to join a neighborhood group. After 9 solidarity loans (group loans) that were all repaid without problem, she's now seeking her first individual loan. With this loan, she intends to buy 3 boxes of perfumes, 20 sheets, 30 pairs of shoes, 10 pieces of fabric, and 5 sets of cups. She gets her supplies in Burkina Fasso and in Bamako. She sells at the market, but also in her neighborhood. Her clientele comprises mostly women. She foresees a monthly profit of XOF 35'000 (ca US$ 70), to be used to repay the loan and to expand her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

Taloitan is a small village which is situated about 37 km from Kupang City. Many coconut and banana trees grow in this village. Most people in this village have a background as farmers who lean on the agriculture sector in meeting their family needs. They usually sell their agricultural products at market in Kupang City as there is no local market available in this area. The challenge that the community faces in running their businesses is the meager availability of public transport in this area. The public transport only operates for 2 days in a week and it costs IDR 25,000 per return trip.\r\n\r\nGibeon C1 is led by Thomas B. - a 33-year-old man. Just as with many other people in this village, Thomas and his wife count on the agriculture sector for their livelihood. From their marriage, Thomas and his wife have been blessed with 3 children, they are: \r\n- Esthon B., 11 years old and in the Fifth Grade of Elementary School;\r\n- Renita B., 9 years old and in the Fourth Grade of Elementary School; and \r\n- Rosana B., 6 years old and in the First Grade of Elementary School.\r\n \r\nAs the father of 3 children, Thomas always works hard to meet all of his family's daily needs by selling vegetables. Thomas and his wife are diligent in cultivating the farm and watering the vegetables on the farm every morning and evening. When the vegetables are ready to be harvested, they will bring them to Inpres Market to be sold on Tuesday and Thursday. They usually open the business in the market at 6 am and close around 2 pm. Nevertheless, the income that Thomas and his wife generate is still not enough to support their family. \r\n\r\nSo Thomas and his neighbors decided to form a group of 8 farmers to join the cattle-fattening program. Thomas is interested in joining the program as he wants to improve his family's finances and to support his children\u2019s education in the future. Thomas is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 from TLM to buy young cattle to fatten over 12 months. The other group members are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle. They really hope that the loan will help them in improving their living standards.  \r\n\r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Adrianus and Osias were replaced by family members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":375949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Taloitan Village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-08-24T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nofima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nohmensen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Osias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2058.89,"local_amount":20400000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-26T08:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":20536593.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159707716},{"amount":666.11,"local_amount":6600000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6644191.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177483713}],"funded_date":"2009-08-26T11:38:32Z","paid_date":"2010-12-02T13:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":135820,"name":"Alfrezina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Alfresina nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Maputo, tem 44 anos de idade, divorciada e m\u00e3e de 3 filhos com idades compreendidas entre 7 e 24 anos, todos freq\u00fcentam escola.

Her house is rented but very cozy.\r\n\r\nFor 15 years she has been selling fruit that is native to the central Peruvian jungle.  But, in the mornings she sells food at a parking lot.

He says that he learned to do the same work with Florentina without fear or shame.  \r\n\r\nThey both say that before they did not even have anything to eat, and they felt helpless seeing their children cry from hunger.  They even sold the few domestic goods they had for one plate of food.  \u201cRemember that these things help me to get ahead,\u201d is what she says.  She also says, \u201cWith God at my side, I do not need anything.  To the contrary, I have enough to share with the rest.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow her jobs are profitable, and they allow her to save.  In the future she plans to set up a store with musical discs and Christian videos to bring the word of God to others.  She also hopes to expand her fruit selling business. \r\n\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  She explains that she won the confidence of the institution by being very responsible and making her payments.  Also, she likes to work with her communal bank.  She is very grateful because she has a prosperous business due to these loans.  She will use the money she is now requesting to buy more discs to sell at the fairs.

She has been working in agriculture since a young age, which she continues doing today side by side with her husband, growing potatoes, peas and gladiolus.

As she is a hard working woman, she wants to expand her production for gladiolus and peas, as they have a good market price.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is very thankful to all the people who made it possible for her to get it, so she can continue working.

","en":"Maria, 46, is a hardworking mother who lives with her husband and their 2 minor children in their own home.  Each day, after carrying out the household chores, she starts working in her business. She makes women's jackets and sweaters, of a variety of types.  Some of her customers are teachers in the neighborhood, to whom she gives credit.  She sells to the rest of her neighbors on a cash basis.  She carries out this activity during the afternoons, and in the mornings she does collections.  What she likes most about her business is that it doesn't take up all of her time.  She has already spent 3 years doing this work, and what she considers most difficult is to make the purchases, because it's hard for her to select the right garments, since she must take into account the tastes of her customers.  For the future she has plans to expand her business and buy more glass display cases.  This is her 10th loan with MFP, and she confirms her commitment to continue making her payments on time.  She is a very responsible woman who is concerned for the well-being and development of her group, since she wants all of the members to get ahead.  Maria is planning to invest the money requested in a variety of garments for her business; in this way she plans to continue developing her business in order to succeed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":551297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"she will buy a variety of merchandise (clothing) for her business   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":189},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":194.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":203.72},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":213.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":222.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.28,"local_amount":175.85,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":177.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934617},{"amount":66.94,"local_amount":189,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":190.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673390},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":194.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":196.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887214},{"amount":72.15,"local_amount":203.72,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":205.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154224},{"amount":75.75,"local_amount":213.86,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":215.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449531},{"amount":78.94,"local_amount":222.9,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":225.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588219}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T19:40:34Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":210381,"name":"Irina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irina is married and has a 10-year-old son.

She works hard every day to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nFor 8 years, Mary has worked making educational materials in an area of her home that has a lot of light.  She works with her mother's help.  Her mother is in charge of highlighting the lines of the drawings with a thick felt-tip pen once Mary has drawn them with the support of her staff.  What Mary likes a lot is making the educational shapes and the bigger her works are the more profits she makes when she sells them.\r\n\r\nMary has years of experience in this work and already has contracts with teachers in private schools.  These teachers are her biggest customers.  In the future, Mary is planning to set up a proper workshop where she can make her products and also where she can more comfortably serve her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Mary's 13th loan with MFP and she has pledged to make her repayments on time as she would like to be able to access further loans so that she can continue making progress.

She will have more time to look after her small children and to take care of household matters.\r\n\r\nTalya is grateful to Manuela Ramos for the loans she has received and hopes to continue working with this organization that brings so much support to working women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":861121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy milk, canned goods, diapers, sugar etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-09-21T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Talya Kandyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":511.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844702},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":511.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238659591},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":511.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244613697},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":511.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828882}],"funded_date":"2011-09-23T06:35:08Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:44:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":341533,"name":"Melania Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La integrantes del grupo invertiran en credito en la compra de materiales para su negocio con el fin de seguir cada d\u00eda mejorandolo.

She is married to Am\u00e9rico, who makes his living transporting goods and is father to their three children, two of whom are already independent.  She lives comfortably with her youngest son Arney, who is 32 years old, in their own home.\r\n\r\nThe activity that Olga engages in is raising free-range chickens.  To do this, she has a small shed with a maximum capacity of 150 chickens, which is set up on the second floor of her house.  There she raises them and sells them in the market, succeeding in selling her entire production.  She also sells fast food at night in front of her house.\r\n\r\nShe started a year ago with her own capital, fruits of her savings, and the support of her son for cleaning and feeding the chickens in his spare time.  She considers the business quite profitable for the demand that this product has, since it is heavily consumed in the daily diet of the population.  She likes this activity since it gives her extra economic income for the household expenses, and also because it helps her feel like a productive woman and pass the time.  On the other hand, what she does not like about this activity is that sometimes part of her production has died due to pestilence, causing some losses.  She has been able to start over thanks to the support of MFP, which is why she has plans to continue with this activity, make some repairs and build a small shed on the first floor of her house, with capacity for 200 chickens.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she counts on their support to be able to carry out her plans.  On the other hand, she says that she will make her repayments, so that she has a good credit record.  Additionally, she is very happy with her community bank, and considers them friendly and supportive people.\r\n\r\nWith the amount she has requested of 1500 nuevos soles, she will invest in repairing the infrastructure of her shed, buying corrugated iron to renovate the roof and chips for the floor for the baby chicks to begin with a new production of at least 150 chickens."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1260009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy corrugated iron to renovate the roof, chips for the floor of the chicken house, and thus start with a new production of at least 150 chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":226.04},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":238.53},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.43},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":249.16},{"due_date":"2013-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":265.94},{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":272.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.42},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.41},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.97},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.66},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.38},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deepa R.","image":null}},{"id":833860,"name":"Dita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders!

Once a month he travels to the neighboring city to purchase new goods, during which time his wife substitutes for him in the market. <p>\r\n\r\nHakim enjoys working for himself, and his business is the main source of income for his whole family. He is now requesting a loan of $1500 USD to purchase new inventory. We believe Hakim\u2018s drive for success will help this young entrepreneur succeed and thrive in business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, she owns and operates a business, selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $110 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Annaliza joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Annaliza is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to continue to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

They live together in their own house located in the town of Quimbiri, which is located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle.  Even though she does not have an education, it has not stopped her from getting ahead.  Cayetana grows cacao on a small parcel of land and it is her only means by which she can supply for her daily needs.  Today she has better financial stability because she produces and sells her cacao products in considerable amounts.  She already has gained more repeat customers, so she tries to complete her orders by the committed delivery dates in order to keep them satisfied.  Cayetana and her husband work together and receive the help of their children during the school holidays.  During the harvest season, she hires workers to expedite gathering of her final product.  She usually works Monday to Saturday from 7am to 6pm.  Her sales are conducted at the local collection center.

Alhassan is going to use his share of this loan to buy house building materials \u2013 bags of cements, sand, iron corrugated zinc, nails, etc. for the construction of a house.  \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other school staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans.

She lives in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She trades in a small market near the station. She sells fruit, vegetables and salads. Her husband and daughter help her in this business she has had for 15 years. Her husband has his own car and helps her with transporting goods. Besides this business,  Saodat is engaged in sewing  national dresses. Her daughter takes orders at home. Saodat plans to use part of the loan to purchase fruit and to use the remainder to purchase fabric, because in the spring there is a demand for national dresses. For this reason Saodat has requested a loan of 1500 USD. \r\n   \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has become an important link between the mountain and coastal regions of the country.  It is a special place, not only for its rich ethnicity, but also for its landscapes that can be found from the entrance to this beautiful city itself.  Santo Domingo de los Colorados currently belongs to the newly formed province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas.  The main festival of Santo Domingo is marked by a large influx of visitors as well as commercial and cultural exchange.  A large fair takes place at the Livestock Farmer's Association facility where the best examples of the different livestock breeds and crosses from farms around the region are shown and compete.  \r\n\r\nYolanda and her husband have been selling fruit for 7 years.  This activity has allowed them to provide for their children.  They live a modest life and have big dreams to improve their financial situation.  Their goal is to have their own car to distribute their products and eliminate having to pay for transportation, the loss of valuable time and no longer have to carry heavy boxes everywhere.  Yolanda initially wants to buy a larger assortment of fruit so she can grow her business.  This will bring them closer to buying a small car that they so badly need.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of the strong competition, Yolanda is optimistic about the return on her investment.  In addition, Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which is the institution brokering the loan transaction will give her training and counseling.  Yolanda and her husband are developing into good clients and we are sure that this loan will bring them closer to their big goal and improve their quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":975043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Esinjohn has been baking trditional bread for 16 years. He began to bake when he was 18 years old, as soon as he graduated from high school. At that time he helped his uncle and he learned to bake. Over time, he separated from his uncle and started his own business. Besides his wife and 3 children, he has his parents to support. His father is an invalid, a veteran of World War II of 1941 - 1945. His mother is pensioner too.  \r\n<p>\r\nUntil recently, income from production and cake sale  were hardly enough to support his family. Additional means were necessary to expand his business and thus to improve their living conditions. In March 2006 he applied to MicroInvest and received his first loan in the amount of $150.

She knows that the majority of young people today can't find work, so with an education at least they can earn income for their families. \r\n\r\nRufina has a sewing workshop in her home.She's had this business for 37 years, having started it out of the necesity to earn money for her home and her children. Rufina's mother taught her this business, and she started it with the hope of earning income.

Sadriddin has always been a hard-working man, who has made sure from a young age that his family never went hungry. He is married with two children. Six years ago, and with a starting capital of only $100, Sadriddin started a grocery store for selling different kinds of foodstuffs. Thanks to his perseverance and dedication, his business has expanded and now his whole family is involved. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Sadriddin needs to increase the range of goods he sells.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in the city of Cuenca. This is a city, known for the charming historic center and also it has a combination of three cultures rich in symbolism, tradition and art: Ca\u00f1ari, Inca y Spanish.\r\n\r\nMs. Blanca is a member of the communal bank Loma de la Cruz. She lives in the city of Cuenca, in the Miraflores area. She is 64 years old and she has been divorced for 15 years. The reasons were that the husband stood for the divorce thinking that the inheritance would be taken and since he was abroad, they divorced. During the marriage, they had 4 children. Three of her children are married and live independently, away from home. Only her single, 27 year old son lives at home and he helps with her business. He does not have his own house because he is renting.\r\n\r\nBlanca has had a store for 10 years. She works from 6 a.m. to 10 p. m., working from Sunday to Sunday and never closing because she has a faithful clientele. If things go well now that she has a large selection of merchandise, she will have a good bond of friendship with all of her communal bank partners. She is in her second cycle of working with the loans from the foundation and it has been beneficial for stocking her business a little more. She tells us that she was influenced to join the bank by her friend Marlene, who is a member. With the new loan that she receives from the foundation, she is going to invest in the purchase of products for her store like rice, sugar, noodles etc. Since all of the products are expensive and she needs to stock her store. Her biggest dream would be to keep her health, so she can continue working. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva

Though tiring work, Luz enjoys the rewards of tending crops until harvest time, when her family transports the produce to a local wholesale market for sale. She has obtained a stable income from her efforts, and in the future plans to expand cultivation to obtain higher returns.

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

Due to the lack of financial means, we are unable to take advantage of this lucrative business. We are also unable to create jobs for our youth who could be taking advantage of this opportunity. Instead, they sail out in wooden pirogue boats to destinations unfamiliar to them. We are requesting a loan from Kiva in order to deal with this situation that the youth of Elinkine are facing, to purchase and resell fresh fish in the large cities of Senegal and neighboring countries like Mali and Guinea Conakry.  This loan will allow us to purchase, conserve and transport fish to the sale outlets.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":194798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase and resale of fresh fish in large cities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Elinkine","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.516667 -16.7","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hyacinthe J Marie","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Allana Carlyle","image":null}},{"id":66179,"name":"Marry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marry K. is a married woman who is 34 years old with three children aged between 7 and 14.

He usually grows corn and cotton on a small plot of 0.25 hectares.  In addition, he and his wife work together as hired farm laborers.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince his family does not earn a steady source of income, he decided to establish a small grocery in his home.  He has been in business for a year and offers basic necessities, groceries, candy, and a few beverages in order to provide additional support to his family.  Manuel decided to expand his business by buying more beverages to offer to his customers.  He is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.\r\n<p>\r\nHis greatest wish is to gradually stop farming in order to expand his business activities by raising and selling animals.

quite responsible and very hardworking.\r\n\r\nIn talking with Maria, she provides us with an example to follow: that one can do anything if one has the will.  She runs a home and is devoted to the care of her children, but also has a family business with her husband.  They have had a business selling CDs on one of the main streets of the capital of Manabi province for more than 6 years.  Her husband started this business, thanks to a friend who motivated him and gave him the space to sell CDs of music and films.   She does not earn much, but with this business she has managed to get ahead.  With the help of the Foundation and all of the loans she has received, she has been able to maintain her business.  At first she had to make a big investment to buy a television, DVD player and amplifier to start the business.  Although each CD only costs a dollar, at the end of the week she has earnings of 40 dollars, and on special dates such as mother's day, she sells more.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Maria will invest in the purchase of more CDs, so she will have a greater variety of films and music CDs.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":534088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy music CDs and DVDs of films   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709136},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":206.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892435},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632795},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846829}],"funded_date":"2010-05-07T15:13:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":202237,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Mar\u00eda del Carmen es viuda , pero esto no le ha impedido ser una mujer luchadora y forjadora, Y  quiere brindar un gran futuro a sus hijos, sabe que poco a poco se consiguen las cosas,   ella se dedica  a su casa y a sus 6 hijos, y adicionalmente  a  vender  frutas,  este negocio lo tiene ubicado en su casa de alquiler, ah\u00ed  vende frutos de la costa  como guineo, naranjas, mandarinas, mangos,  el dinero que solicita es para invertir en su negocio, sus compras Las realiza en la ciudad de Portoviejo en el mercado numero 2, Mar\u00eda del Carmen  invierte de 200 a 300 d\u00f3lares, aparte de la inversi\u00f3n por cada compra  tiene que pagar el carro que le transporta sus frutos, cada semana o quince d\u00edas compra frutas frescas y  tiene mucha demanda por parte de sus clientes, lo que m\u00e1s vende es el mango , mandarina, naranjas, su negocio lo atiende desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 8 de la noche.\n\nDesde que quedo viuda, ella tiene un solo objetivo, que ahora se podr\u00eda deducir en su sue\u00f1o, pero que con los a\u00f1os seguramente se realizara, su sue\u00f1o  es poder tener su casa propia, para que sus hijos tengan un futuro,  que estudien para que alg\u00fan d\u00eda le puedan ayudar, son lo \u00fanico que tiene.

She runs a small business in the central city market selling kid\u2019s clothing. Her vending spot is well known for her wide variety of inventory.

Dilbar\u2019s hard work, plain and simple, is the engine that drives her success. She is very consistent in her business planning. Now she is requesting a loan of 9,500 Somoni to increase her assorted merchandise in a recently opened vending location and to expand her trade. One of Dilbar\u2019s long-term plans is to launch her own start-up manufacturing and selling clothing and increase her stock turnover as a result. \r\n  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. lives in the city of Yavan. She is 49 years old, married and has 7 children. Kumri has a high school diploma. She takes care of the house and her business is cattle rearing. Kumri has a cow; the milk from this cow is used for the family and also for sale. She sells milk at a market to whole sale buyers. Kumri plans to purchase one more cow in order to increase the volume of milk, thereby increasing her profits. If there is additional milk, Kumri would be able to sell more and receive greater income.

The couple have in their care four children, who are all in school.  Ms. Justine L. has been residing with her husband in the Ay\u00e9lawadj\u00e8 district for almost six months.  She has been selling staple foods for over five years, making sales through a distribution system but also out of the front of her house.  Currently, she has built a shop that will serve as a storehouse and place of business.  She started the aforementioned business around 2003 with start-up funds of 80,000 francs CFA.  Confronted with the problem of inventory and supplies a few months afterwards, she turned to outside financing.  This is why she obtained her first loan on October 25, 2004 in the amount of 50,000 francs, which enabled her to start buying in bulk.  She has come to request as her fifth loan 250,000 francs for acquiring supplies.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

and sells in commercial city markets. This work is very agreeable to him, because raising animals is what he has enjoyed since he was a young boy. Nevertheless he also has other jobs, and one of those is farming potatoes and corn in their respective seasons, taking in to account the bad weather that could damage his products. He requires a certain amount of money to increase the number of his sheep. His goal is to increase his product and thereby increase his household income, and to be solvent in order to continue buying and selling animals. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and her 3 younger children in their own house.  She makes a living as a nanny, and works near her home from morning until 2 in the afternoon.  At 3 p.m. Dominga opens up a clothing stand at the entrance to her home, where she has sold clothing for many years.  She really likes this business because it generates good profits; she gives most of the credit to the items she sells and to her neighbors.  On weekends she dedicates all of her time to selling clothing, since those are very busy days for her business.  Dominga\u2019s greatest wish is to have a large quantity of garments, especially the ones that are sought after by young girls in the neighborhood, as those are what sell the most quickly.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
