What he likes most about his work is that he can converse and share ideas among co-workers and he considers the most difficult part to be carrying dirt and cement, among other things used in construction and that's very tiring.  It is for this reason, that he responded to the financial officers at MFP to request a loan which he can invest in opening an exclusive clothing store.  This will be his first loan with MFP, therefore, he needs the support of financers in order to continue growing.

The common livelihood is farming and fishing, however, due to scarcity of capital, Medcilyne's husband does not farm or fish; he chooses to do carpentry, for this job does not require capitalization. \r\n\r\nBefore she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.) she bought and re-sold whatever goods she could just to have an income, on irregular days of the week. She applied for this loan to get capital to buy one pig for fattening, to buy 10 chickens to raise, and buy assorted ingredients to start up food vending. She will utilize the loan properly so as to get another loan in the future to expand her business and to increase her income for the education of her children who are now going to finish their secondary school.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products in the local community. Nellie has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Nellie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nellie has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. Nellie is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to expand the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nellie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is known for being an entrepreneurial and fair man. Alongside him is his wife Esperanza who is 47 and with whom he has four children. Only two of them, the youngest ones, live in his home. He has been dedicated to farming for thirty years and thanks to effort and dedication to this activity he has achieved that his older children are now professionals. Parallel to this work, he is dedicated to interprovincial transportation since he has two vehicles. He has 15 years experience with this activity. The manager is his eldest daughter. Meanwhile, the farming work is performed by operators who watch over and take care of the development and production of their crops. His wife is dedicated to the daily preparation of food then she brings lunch to the farms. What he likes most about his work is to sow maize and alfalfa greens which he takes care of until harvest time.

fruit vending, pig fattening and carpentry. She lives in Manan-ao, Barangay Ticad, Bantayan, Cebu City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fruit vending, pig fattening and carpentry businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5000. Basilia is now borrowing PHP 17000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Basilia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The picture was taken in the home of Mrs. Mar\u00eda M. D., a member of the group.  We can see in the photograph the three wheeled vehicle that she uses in the sale of shaved ice and ice cream.  She is 36 years old, has not gone to school and makes a living producing and selling shaved ice.  She has 3 sons.  She has been in the sale of shaved ice for 18 years.

She is 34 years old and married. To make a living, she owns and operates a fishing business, harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $163 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mirasol joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. \r\n\r\nMirasol is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They recently joined their lives together before God and now live in their own home in the community of Sanchirio, which is in the central Peruvian jungle.  This incredible man, whose life is full of great joy and love, now wants to start a family through work and great dedication.  Reflecting this wish are the four years he has already dedicated himself to farming.  His main crops consist of coffee and bananas.  Every morning, Edgar cares for, fertilizes, and clears his land so that he can sell to the buyers who frequently visit the area.  What he enjoys most is harvesting bananas because they generate a steady income.  Edgar is already known among the brokers.  In the future, he wants to buy more farmland so that he can plant in larger quantities, thus allowing him to generate more income so that he can educate and feed his future children.  \r\n<p>\r\nEdgar is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cBuenos Aires\u201d and will be receiving his fourth loan from MFP.  He is pleased with the mutual support he has received because it has enabled him to work with a greater peace of mind.  In addition, he promises to be punctual with his loan payments.  With the support he received, Edgar will invest the money he requested in the purchase of natural fertilizers.  If there is money left over, he will hire workers to remove the weeds from the fields.

She is 42 years old and a resident of Tanza, Cavite City in the Philippines.  She is married and the mother of three children.  Her husband, Joey, is her business partner. Together, she and her husband manage the household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to meet her everyday expenses. \r\n \r\nPaz operates a junk shop.  Trash is not formally sorted in the Philippines and, while waiting for local dump trucks to collect the garbage, people scavenge trash bags and garbage dumps for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic and paper, which they sell to junk shops like Paz\u2019s for a profit.  The junk shops then stack, clean and gather large quantities of these materials to sell to foundries, factories and others in need of these materials.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 22,000 PHP. She will augment her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors with the funds from the loan.  She expects an increase in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPaz hopes her business grows more in the coming years.  She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship members both to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners and\/or clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.  A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.  The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":946516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for scrap materials to sell in her junk shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T21:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1466.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4400.01,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4416.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738887},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":7332.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7359.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146113},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":5867.04,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5888.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275286},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4399.96,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4415.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997830}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:43:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:47:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Worth","image":668464}},{"id":375187,"name":"Danilo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Danilo is a married man with four children, living in the town of Talibon, Bohol.

This system of credit helps them to work better with their capital, to save, to be supportive and, of course, to promote responsibility.<p>\r\n\r\nThese women work in different types of activities to improve their financial incomes. Among these activities we can cite: sale of clothes, edibles, pastries, cosmetics, fruits and vegetables, natural products, beverages and ice creams, hamburgers and recycling.  They also work to improve their families and to serve their roles of mother and housewife.  In addition they carry out these activities, since the cost of living is very high and they come from very humble families.  Their greatest desire is to give a better future to their children.  \r\n<p>\r\nAs a group they also carry out activities with the purpose of collecting funds for their savings.  They request today a loan with the purpose of investing in the purchase of merchandise, supplies and necessary ingredients for their different activities.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEste Comit\u00e9 se formo en julio del 2006.

Amriddin is dedicated to the production of dairy cattle. With a lot of effort and sacrifice he carries out this work every day for the purpose of improving the conditions of his family and bringing the daily bread to his table. At the same time, he is saving for the improvement of his dwelling, which needs a lot of help because it is in a bad state but which, little by little, he has come to improve. His family admires him for the fact that his multiple efforts have permitted him to bring food to his home and that in addition, Amriddin has managed to keep his three children in school.\r\n<p>\r\nThe need that this gentleman faces is to invest in the development of his business through the purchase of cows. In this he hopes that IMON International, with the help of Kiva, will offer him the loan to help him to do well along with his family.\r\n<p><br>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been selling for more than 5 years, which she started at the same time that she started her college studies with the goal of helping her mother.  Previously, she also sold cosmetics, mostly to her friends, but her friends started asking her for clothes, so she decided to sell those products instead.  She is very grateful for everything that has happened, which has allowed her to grow and to help her Mother's business.   For this reason she is seeking a loan \u2013 for working capital to buy pajamas, children's clothes, and more women's clothes in order to diversify her selection and thus generate a little more income.

He sells vehicle paints to the mechanics at the garage and to his loyal customers, who are mostly from Kariobangi. He has been running this business for seven years and has two employees. He says that his business is profitable and that his main challenge is financial constraints and, therefore, reduced stock levels. Also, there are other similar businesses in the area so customers are not loyal as they are spoilt\r\n for choice. However, he works very hard to make sure his business continues to do well. \r\n\r\nHe is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy more vehicle paints to serve a larger clientele and, thus, increase his profit margin.

She lives in a rented house in a town located in the Ayacuchan jungle called Palmapampa.\r\n<p>\r\nLeonarda never forgot those afternoons in her youth when she watched her grandparents clear the land and plant cacao seeds.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNena is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Nena owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice and corn for sale. Nena has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nena is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Nena from GDMPC.

Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 58 years old, widowed and has five adult children. To make a living, Saturnina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Saturnina has been engaged in her business for over 35 years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP during the harvest season.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Saturnina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Saturnina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the eighth loan that Saturnina has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

is full of challenges and that is what makes people stronger and fonder. Like other woman, 38-year-old Jocelyn C. encounters many challenges in life brought about by poverty. Jocelyn is from Malabor, Tibiao, Antique, Philippines. She is married to Rene C., a fish vendor, and they have five children. Their eldest child is already 17 years old while the youngest is 7 years old. All of the children are still studying.\r\n\r\nThis family earns a living by buying and selling fish. They earn a small amount from the business, but sometimes their income is not enough to meet their basic needs because they do not have enough capital. Therefore, Jocelyn decided to join ASHI and borrow capital. She continued their business with capital of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nJocelyn is always inspired to improve the business because the children are studying. The support of her husband is always there. For her second loan from ASHI, she applied for 10,000 PHP and this will be used as additional capital for fish vending. Her greatest dream in life is to brighten the future of her children by sending them to school until they get a professional degree. She also wants to build a concrete house someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":629929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have two children, Jair and \u00c1ngel. They care and provide for their children in their own home in the hamlet of Bellavista Huaracayo. Only 9 years ago she started farming. She leases her lands each year and plants with her husband's help. They sow peas and other vegetables. What she most enjoys about her work is being in the field; she says \"I feel peaceful\". She also says that she \"never loses\", because when the price of peas is low in the market, she dries the grain and sells it as a seed. This makes an earning of a little more than the invested money, since each bag of peas hovers around a minimum price of 500 soles. Her main difficulty is not having her own land, and having to pay for her children's studies. So, she plans to save at every opportunity in order to be able to buy more agricultural lands, thus minimizing the costs of leasing. She now plans to venture into sowing potato this season.

He was born and lives in the town of Kapan. He has higher education and graduated from the Pedagogical Institute of Yerevan. In 1988 he got married and now lives with his wife. He has a 22 year old son who is now serving in the army. His daughter is nineteen and she is studying in her junior year at the Yerevan Institute of Linguistics with specialty as a teacher of foreign languages. Yurik's wife works in the military recruitment office in the town of Kapan.\r\n\r\nYurik has been in the distribution business since 2006. He has a contract with a firm which manufactures natural juices, ice cream, cookies, confections, meat products, cutlets and etc. Yurik buys all these products and juices in wholesale, delivers them from Yerevan and then sells them in wholesale to the stores in towns of Kapan, Kadjaran, Agarak and Mergi. Yurik has storage and refrigerators in his house for the business. \r\n\r\nYurik works almost without any days off and already has many regular customers in these towns who for many years prefer to buy in wholesale what Yurik brings from Yerevan and then sell in their own stores. Thanks to the profit from his business Yurik can support his family and pay for his daughter's education. Yurik needs a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 Armenian dram to buy new products for the New Year and Christmas sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":911601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods

Today he runs a small real estate consulting agency providing information about real estate market rates, mortgages, lending conditions and trends in the community. Nikolai has been in this business for about one year and makes around $1,000-1,500 in monthly income.\r\n\r\nNikolai is very cheerful and client-friendly. His natural ability to make every customer feel welcome and his willingness to best serve his clients\u2019 needs have ensured the success of his small business. One of Nikolai\u2019s partners is a local construction company. Cooperation with this company helps him stay informed on the latest developments in the real estate market and get many new clients as a result. Nikolai has repaid four loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d which have helped to stabilize and grow his business.\r\n\r\nHe would like to get a loan for $600 to print advertising leaflets for his consulting agency and to give him some additional capital for small expenses.

Financial assistance will give Nikolai\u2019s business the economic boost it needs to continue to meet the needs of his customers.

Being a mother to three sons, she lives the humble life of a shepherd\u2019s wife. Twenty years ago, her husband inherited some cattle from his parents and since then, he has been raising cattle and working as a shepherd. <P>\r\n\r\nAtyrkul, being a housewife, takes care of the household. She also actively helps her husband look after their cattle. Her daily routine begins with milking cows in the morning, then selling the milk to her neighbors. Besides cows, they keep some other livestock, too. So, Atyrkul has always a lot to do around the house. <P>\r\n\r\nHaving lived all her life in a rural area, she decided to send her eldest son to college, to live in the city. Two other sons live at home and help their parents. By selling some of their livestock, they managed to buy a house, though Atyrkul\u2019s monthly income from selling milk is just US$ 65. <P>\r\n\r\nNow, Atyrkul is desperate to buy another cow. One more cow means more milk for sale, consequently more daily income to save for their second son\u2019s education. For villagers every liter of milk is valuable, since it brings cash, which is a rare thing in a village area.<P>\r\n\r\nHere are Atyrkul\u2019s partners: Amanbu, Altyn and Nazira. Amanbu is fifty. With her husband she keeps livestock: one cow and twenty sheep. Her husband is an electrician, but Amanbu, being a housewife, meets her daily needs by selling milk. Now, Amanbu wants to get a loan to buy a calf and with the rest of the loan she would purchase sheep for fattening and resale. <P>\r\n\r\nAltyn is twenty-five. She is married and has three children. To help her husband, who is a welder, she sells foodstuffs and earns US$ 130. She needs a loan to include more vegetables, fruit, and salads in her assortment. <P>\r\n \r\nNazira is twenty-three. She is not married yet. However, for five years already she has lived independently in terms of finances, as she has been selling newspapers, magazines and some detergents. Nazira needs a loan to open a small shop to sell detergents out of. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<P>\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

He started working as an apprentice in another workshop and he grew to like the trade, so he managed to buy his own sewing machine and gradually acquire other necessary tools.  He decided to establish his business from his home, but he did not have enough customers.  But this did not get him down, because having his own business helped him to get ahead and with the support of these loans he will achieve success.  Currently he requests financing for working capital so that he can buy fabric, scissors, thread, embroidery and buttons because we are approaching the school season.  His wish is to expand his premises a little more and offer employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Everyday Edita wakes up very early to care for her children and to get them ready for school. Next, she begins the long trek to sell beauty products which she has been selling for the past three years. Although she is tired from doing housework and then going to work, she appreciates it a lot because she can earn her own money and this makes her feel accomplished because she doesn't have to depend so much on her husband.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she believes that her power of persuasion to recommend what type of makeup fits each person is what allows her to sell her merchandise not only to clients that she knows, but also to strangers, who can rely on her good taste. She is also an enterprising woman who has plans in the future to move her store to her home where she can sell her products in greater comfort and open up a clothing store, as well.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Edita's first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she promises to make all of her payments because she does not want to make a bad impression with the other members of the group. She plans to invest the money she is requesting in buying a greater quantity of merchandise, especially her special order products, so that she can have them in stock and sell them for higher prices later on.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Sindewald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":483376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"increase stock of special order merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-05T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960331},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993178},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717963},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751639},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934106},{"amount":34,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":96.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672880}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T16:20:15Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Sindewald","image":null}},{"id":178199,"name":"Faasaveve","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faasaveve T. is 58 and married with 4 children (ages 12 - 29).

Faasaveve needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faasaveve joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasaveve's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasaveve T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The first loan of 12,000 meticais was used to buy agricultural supplies for his machamba (a large garden or small field).  These 15,000 meticais will be used to increase his inventory and meet the needs of the pilgrims.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan ahead of schedule and ask for another to begin building a chicken coop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

R. is 29 years old, married and supports her family by operating three business ventures: furniture making, food vending and a piggery. She lives in Prk. 2, Brgy. Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her furniture making, food vending and piggery businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,200. \r\n\r\nMichelle is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase new equipment. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Michelle aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare and pay school fees of her children.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The majority of the members work in the cultivation and sale of garden plants, some sell groceries, and a few sell clothes for men, women, and children.  A special characteristic of the group is their unity, which is demonstrated as they coordinate the sale of their products each weekend in the main neighborhood square. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group is currently in the 7th cycle of the Entrepreneurial Women program, where each member manages an average credit of ~$188.  The members are involved in the sale of plants, clothing, and groceries. <p>\r\n\r\nThe women of the committee found out about the program through the local newspaper, and got in contact with the Caacupe office program advisor.  The group of 15 women formed quickly, calling itself the \u201cTekova Pora Rekavo\u201d committee, and the first meetings were carried out in group president Marta S.\u2019s home.  They are very grateful to Fundacion Paraguaya for the support they are receiving through the program, and that not only are they receiving credit, but also training that helps them learn how to confront the challenges that come with being small businesswomen. <p>\r\n\r\nThe loan they receive will be invested in the purchase of fertilizer, flowerpots, seeds, and garden plants; other women will invest it in the purchase of basic products like sugar, herbs, milk, and beef among others. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Kennedy de Caacup\u00e9, la mayor\u00eda de las integrantes se dedican al cultivo y venta de plantas para jard\u00edn, algunas poseen despensas y una minor\u00eda se dedica a la venta de ropas para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os, una de las  caracter\u00edsticas muy especial del grupo es que son muy unidas, inclusive cuando deben coordinar la  exposici\u00f3n de sus productos los fines de semana en la plaza del barrio. <p>\r\n\r\nActualmente el grupo se encuentra en el 7mo. ciclo del programa de comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, y la misma est\u00e1n siendo beneficiadas con un cr\u00e9dito promedio de gs. 853.000 cada integrante.

Odildjon is 33 years old. He is married and has two children. Odildjon is a very diligent and hardworking man. With his car, he is providing taxi services. For the last 3 years, this business has been the main income for the family, allowing Odildjon to improve the living conditions of his large family. Along with his wife and children, he is also supporting his mother and brother. As any business generating income, the business of Odildjon also requires some investments from time to time. Thus, his car needs some fixing. For this purpose, Odildjon requests 1,500 USD for purchasing spare parts. Odildjon promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all supporting him.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tajikistan:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Also, she wants to take advantage of the Christmas season because that is when she sells the most.\r\n\r\nThis has made her decide to request this loan from Integral.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She  supports her family by operating 2 business ventures:  used clothing and ready-to-wear (RTW) businesses. She lives in Brgy. Tugas, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nRedela has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her used clothing and RTW businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6400 PHP. \r\n\r\nRedela is now borrowing 19,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Redela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

There he has a business where he sells drinks, soft drink and has games available, like billiards and domino. And this is where the name of the business comes from: \"Billares Domino\". Domingo started this activity because he had had previous administration experience, for several years in his birthplace. He says that it was through this business that \"doors opened\". He took advantage of the opportunities in the market, becoming independent and reaching many of his expansion goals. He is investing his Kiva loan, the first loan that he accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner), on the purchase of fruit juices, soft drinks by the box, and drinks. His goal is to supply himself and to sell in retail and to businesses who have sold out of the products. His greatest challenge is a limited capital to use for expansion, as well as the competition.
