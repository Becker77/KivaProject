She is a single mother, but that hasn't stopped her from providing for her four children, whom she not only provided a place to live, but also educated from their youth with morals. This tough role of being mother and father to her children filled her with vitality because without that she would not have succeeded in her work, selling meals and breakfasts at the markets. When she began her work she sold sandwiches in the streets, but over time has come to selling food at the markets, thanks to working with her sister, with whom she joined forces and opened a booth at the local market. This work keeps her very busy, but happy, now that her dreams have been realized so that she can make her business better. Enriqueta plans to become independent and have her own business location so that she can increase her revenue and finish paying for her children's school.

Mutalib has been dedicated to the business of cattle ranching for the last 10 years. This business requires a lot of dedication for the fact that it demands a lot of effort to carry out the breeding. This is also true due to the fact that it requires the strict control of every one of the animals, while at the same time feeding and caring for those that are older. It is necessary to emphasize that through this business Mutalib is able to maintain his spouse and his 4 children. It is because of this he is soliciting a loan through IMON International. The credit will allow him to buy more animals, which he will raise and sell in the market. Mutalib has gained a reputation for responsibility with his financial obligations and for keeping his word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tajikistan:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Artemia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Artemia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":395964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 49 years old, married, and has 6 children. She lives in the hamlet of La Puerta in the Lepaguare community in Olancho.\r\nShe started out earning a living selling cosmetics, but now she sells second hand clothes for kids and bedding. She had the idea to start this business after seeing some of her neighbors selling clothes and doing well from it. So, she bought a bundle of clothes and got very good returns and also was able to keep some items for her own use. She does not have set work hours, but her customers can come and find her in her house and she also goes around the community making sales when she has finished the daily housework. One of the advantages of this work is that the income enables her to help her husband with the household expenses. One of the drawbacks is that, as she sells her goods in the street, she is exposed to all types of weather. \r\nShe will use this loan to buy three bundles of second-hand clothing and this will leave her business better supplied. The resulting income will enable her to keep supporting the daily needs of her family.

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a General Store and a Rice Retailer business. Her husband Francisco, who is 66 years old, works as a Driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n\r\nThey have 3 children who are between 33 to 38 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and rice to sell so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of business.   Teresita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)  is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been selling clothes for more than two years and offers her merchandise to acquaintances and relatives.  Luz offers her products on credit and is assured of full payment for the garments that she sells.  She also engages in farming and has land that her parents inherited.  This enables her family to generate extra income.  However, she enjoys managing her clothing business more because farming requires that one must wait some time before seeing any profit.  In addition, farming requires capital to invest in supplies for fertilizing the land.  Luz will continue in both business activities in hopes of improving her sales and her farm production.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Being part of a Communal Bank has significant meaning to Luz because she has a group of people who have complete trust in her.

She has two years of experience in this business. Ruta needs a loan of WST 1500. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn 2010, Ruta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Ruta's second loan with SPBD. \n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is actually true, especially for those people who live in the provinces and work hard the whole day like farmers and other laborers - just like the people in the village where Marittes and her family live.\r\n\r\nThus, Marittes thought that the business she planned would be appropriate to the needs of the people around her. Some of the food items she is going to cook and sell such as \u201cbananaque\u201d (bananas deep-fried and sweetened) will be directly sold house to house during snack-break while others will be sold in front of her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":482496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Do\u00f1a Eufemia receives a pension for her many years of labor, which she uses to pay her expenses.  She is a diabetic and has specific nutritional needs.  Being a diabetic is very difficult for her as the cost of treatment is very high.  Through the loans she has received she has been able to make improvements to her house and spread out her payments over time.  With this loan she will be able to repair the wall behind her house, which is in poor condition, before it falls and costs her even more money.

He is a courageous single man who has two children: 5 year-old Yero and 3 year-old Alexis.  They live together in their own home in the community of Sanchirio del Palomar (central Peruvian jungle).  This young and responsible father works hard on his land.  His main crops are bananas and coffee.  He mentions that they have been making a good profit for two years since his crops, during the agricultural seasons, are the best in the area.\r\n\r\nWith training, Ricardo has managed to achieve good coffee beans, while his bananas provide him with stability as he harvests them every 15 days and then sells them in the town's central market.  For this reason, in the future he would like to buy more land to which he can apply everything that he has learned.\r\n\r\nThis is Ricardo's second loan with MFP and he hopes to continue getting ahead in life together with his community bank.  He will use his loan to buy 20 sacks of organic fertilizer and 2,000 coffee plants for his nursery.  He will use them to renew his plantation crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":650399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

As they wait for the previous meeting to end, they greet each other with hugs and a chorus of \u2018buenos dias\u2019 and \u2018como estas\u2019, followed by excited chatter in their native language Kaqchiquel. As the other meeting lets out and the women begin to file in, the cream colored room becomes a canvas of brilliant colors, painted by the beautiful and intricate \u2018huipiles\u2019 (traditional woven blouses) that each woman wears.  \r\n\r\n<P>These huipiles are just one of many trades that the women practice. Among the eighteen, about half of them dedicate their time to weaving and sewing skirts (like the ones in the picture), scarves, purses, belts, ribbons that get woven into long braids, as well as huipiles. Ten of the 18 women are asking for a group loan of 26,000 quetzales ($3425), ranging from $150 to $400 per person, five of whom will invest in thread for their artisan business (one of them was not able to be present for the photo). Two women have jewelry businesses, making beaded bracelets, necklaces, rings and earrings that they sell in the nearby tourism capital Panajachel. Two women have small stores, selling soft drinks, snacks, chicken and sausages. And one woman, who could not be at the meeting because she was sick, has a tortiller\u00eda, and will invest in the ingredients necessary for making corn and flour tortillas.\r\n\r\n<P>The women of Mujeres Jardin have been with Friendship Bridge for two years, but have been together as a group much longer. They were previously with another institution, but were looking for a lower interest rate, which Friendship Bridge offers. They are more than happy with their new microfinance home, and are excited to see the long-term benefits for their business that less interest will bring. In addition to lower interest, one of their favorite things about Friendship Bridge is the education they receive\u2014they are learning how to better run their business, care for their family, and have a real hope for the future (and they like that they get to play games while they learn, too!)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3425,"image":{"id":132572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"These

Her dreams are to have a plot where she may offer her products to her clients, that would be her own place that could pass through generations in her family. Her dreams also include having a large quantity of merchandise to continue contributing more to her family income so that her children never go without daily essentials like bread.\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is the sale of clothing, in which she specializes in underwear, camisoles, socks, and stockings. Her business is conducted on a mobile basis. She has had her business for 11 years, starting it because she needed work and did not have a professional track to aspire to. Furthermore, she was also motivated to start this type of travelling business because she needed to separate from her first life partner with whom she had a daughter. It is with her maternal love and desire to better her daughter\u2019s future that she undertook the challenge of starting this business when, in the beginning, she had no experience. Yet with the passing of time she obtained what was necessary to know how to control and manage her business. This loan will be used as capital to buy products, and so she asks for the help of Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the other organizations that concern themselves with helping the people who truly need it.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":253171,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Capital to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T07:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gleysi Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1055.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":1055.56,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399975},{"amount":68.62,"local_amount":1303.8,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1368.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091973},{"amount":42.49,"local_amount":807.32,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":847.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985357},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":1055.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445973},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":1055.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1108.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956614},{"amount":222.21,"local_amount":4222.2,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4433.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174042}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T14:55:37Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Capetola","image":null}},{"id":87203,"name":"Zoila Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ZOILA ROSA M.

It has been created in 2009 by a group of women who wanted to bring together all their peers in the district of Angle Serigne Fallou (ASF) under the slogan \u201cmutual aid for doing work.\u201d The group is led by Mrs. Marie N.

friend in her mother-in-law's house in Las Vegas del Tortuguero, located in Lim\u00f3n near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Ana works on a farm owned by her mother-in-law. She is involved in the rearing and selling of pigs and chickens, and in catalogue sales. Her clients include neighbours and members of the larger community. An obstacle for Ana has been the water system which she uses to wash the pig pen. The pump and hoses often break down, making her task all the more difficult. This loan will be used to finance the purchase of one pig and to make reparations to the existing pig pen. Ana organizes her work day so that in the morning she tends to the animals, and in the afternoon she completes her household duties. Her main goal is to generate as much income as possible from pig, chicken and catalogue sales. She works so that (with the help of her husband) she will one day be able to move out of her mother-in-law\u00b4s house and into her own house.\r\n\r\nThe loan consultant that has been working with Ana describes her as an exceptionally hardworking mother. She undertakes her work with much enthusiasm because she has seen how the income she earns as a result of her productive activity contributes significantly to family well-being. Specifically, Ana has been able to make contributions to a savings account which she plans to use to finance the construction of a new house.

Se dedic\u00f3 a esta actividad debido a que son pocas las fuentes de empleo y con estos productos genera ingresos para su hogar, aunque tambi\u00e9n trabaja tres horas en la ma\u00f1ana prestando el servicio de aseo a una empresa de la poblaci\u00f3n y con todo esto y los ingresos de su esposo, que es moto taxista (un sistema de transporte muy utilizado en esta poblaci\u00f3n), se sostienen como familia. Ella dice que debe  trabajar mucho y duro para sostener y criar a su hijo, y tambi\u00e9n para poder capacitarse y llegar a tener un futuro mejor. Para Claudia, una vez muri\u00f3 su padre, la vida se torn\u00f3 mas dura  sin \u00e9l, quien  la ayudaba mucho y siempre estaba pendiente de su familia y esto aunque hace 3 a\u00f1os, ha marcado su vida para siempre.\nElla ya hab\u00eda recibido 1 pr\u00e9stamo  de la Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, y desde que los recibi\u00f3 el negocio ha generado mas ingresos para el sostenimiento de la familia, compraron un lote y muebles para el hogar, y  en estos momentos tienen una moto de su propiedad. Est\u00e1 aplicando con este pr\u00e9stamo a un monto de $1.100.000 COP, que  invertir\u00e1 en compra de hilaza para tejer hamacas, hilo para mochilas y bolsos. Siguiendo adelante, su meta es tener su casa propia y un negocio con su local sea de artesan\u00edas o una droguer\u00eda (en lo cual tiene experiencia) ya que se ha capacitado en cursos de administraci\u00f3n de medicamentos de droguer\u00eda.\n","en":"Claudia Patricia \u00c1lvarez B. lives with her husband and eight year old son in a town near Cartagena.  She is 26 years old and a naturally talented craftswoman.  Claudia learned this traditional skill from her neighbors.  She currently produces woven satchels and handbags on a vertical loom, while her mother makes woven hammocks.  Claudia started this business because there were few employment opportunities and these products allow her to generate income from home.  In addition, she works three hours in the morning providing cleaning services to a local business.  Combined with the income of her husband who works as a motorcycle taxi driver (the most common form of transportation in this area), Claudia is able to support her family.  She says she must work long and hard to support, raise, and teach her son so that he can have a better future.  After her father passed away, Claudia says life was much harder without him since he had been a great help and was an outstanding presence in her family.  Even though he died three years ago, his mark on her life will last forever.  \r\n<p>\r\nClaudia has already received one loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and since then, her business has generated more income to support her family.  She was able to buy a plot of land and furniture for her home.  Her family even has their own motorcycle.  Claudia is applying for a loan in the amount of 1,100,000 COP to invest in the purchase of yarn for making hammocks, satchels, and handbags.  To continue moving forward, her goal is to have her own house and her own business location for either a craft shop or a drugstore since she has previous experience and pharmacy training.  <br

The fruit of their sweetest love are their four children. Her eldest child is already 14 years old while the youngest is 6 years old and all of them are still studying. Ice cream vending is their primary source of  income; this is where they get money for their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nSince all of their children are studying, they must strive hard in order to survive and meet the basic needs of the family. They wake up early in the morning just to prepare the ice cream because after their breakfast her husband sells that ice cream in the nearby neighborhoods. As food vendors, they maintain the quality of their products so that they gain more customers because they say, customers are very important in business.\r\n\r\nAside from ice cream vending, Elarian also makes salted and coated peanuts and she sells them to their neighbors and distributes to some stores. \r\n\r\nElarian has been an active member of ASHI Antique North Branch since 2005. She maintains 100%  rate in repayment, attendance and project. She has also accessed incentive loans of ASHI such as House Repair Loan and Educational Loan because of her good performance as a member.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dream is to improve their production and to send their children to school until college. She wants their children to become professionals someday. They also wish that someday their business will improve so that they can help their relatives and neighbors by providing jobs for them.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan in ASHI, Elarian is planning to buy a tricycle (three-wheeled transport vehicle), so that their products will reach to other neighborhoods and municipalities especially since the fiesta in some neighborhoods in Culasi is approaching. \r\n\r\nDuring fiesta and summer days, ice cream sells quickly; that is why they want to take this opportunity. She needs Php 30,000 in order to realize these dreams and if this request is granted, it would be a great help to them in providing for the basic needs of the family.

She faces the challenge of raising her children alone and provides them with the basic things they need every day. \r\n\r\nSince this is the case, Desiree wants to have a stable source of income. With low educational attainment, she believes that the only way she can attain this is by growing her own business since she cannot get employed in any government or private office. \r\n\r\nFortunately, she heard about ASHI and the services it offers to poor women. After she was recognized as an official member of the institution just recently, she requested a loan to start up a fish-selling business. \r\n\r\nShe expects that the profit from this business that is just getting started will be small.

He has six children, with only four going to school on the grounds of his modest earnings.\r\n\r\nS. has subsisted on a low-earning fishing and retailing business for the last two years in his area of Nanso, Buziika, and Lugazi. He mostly sells fish, sugar, salt, paraffin, soap and oil. In a month he excitedly says he makes more than 300,000 shillings and is looking forward to making even more with the acquisition of this loan. Behind the excitement however, he knows he has responsibility that he owes to his children, especially those not at school.\r\n\r\nWith no previous business experience, S., to all intents and purposes, got started in his business on a low-key note with persuasion from his brother who was also inclined towards doing business. From then on he did not rest on his laurels as he knew he had to work hard to see success within his grasp. With this determination, his business turned a new leaf. The benefactors are his first two children: he managed to provide for their education.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, S. is optimistic that his businesses will see a new lease of life as he intends to buy fishing nets and additional retail stock.

Since she was young she has worked to be successful to benefit her family, which has few financial resources. The salary she earns as a custodian is barely enough for her family's basic grocery needs; she has five children. She and her husband struggle to improve their small house; he works as a gardener and receives a low salary, but it is a steady job. With her last loan, Teresa was able to build a small wall to shelter her property. With this loan, she will begin to build concrete walls by buying the materials needed to complete the construction and to be able to finish it in the long term, since the prices are high right now. She needs to build the entire house from concrete, divide the rooms, and lay down tile.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase materials needed to provide her service. Remedios is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more materials needed for the service. This will be her third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

province of Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating a business distributing herbal products. Her husband, Rogelio, who is 57 years old, works as an X-ray Technologist to earn his living, and he also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nAntonia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5500 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use in purchasing herbal products to sell. She plans to continue saving up for the future education of her niece and nephew.\r\n<p>\r\nAntonia F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: <br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than 1 USD a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her dream is to have her own school with more courses. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate started the program for the benefits to her business.  Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally.  Many of the group's Dominican clients recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.\r\n\r\nYuri's group is located in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominates the economy.

","en":"Zholdoshbek is a 41-year-old farmer, living with his family in the Zhergetal village (Northern Kyrgyzstan).  He is raising five school-age children: three sons and two daughters.  In search of sources of income for his family, Zholdoshbek started a business of fattening up and reselling livestock in 1993.  Starting with a sum of 3,000 som (KGS), Zholdoshbek was able to develop his farm to have a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS).  Also, Zholdoshbek's wife, Aynagul, is involved in retail sales at a small food stall, and this brings in additional income for the family.  To further develop his business, Zholdoshbek requested a loan in the of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase livestock.  He plans to use the profits from this loan to build a big house for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":875606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhergetal village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zholdoshbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":562.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:16Z","rounded_local_amount":25410.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250583},{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25410.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338990}],"funded_date":"2011-10-20T00:50:31Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":342129,"name":"Saphina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saphina is 17 years old and lives in the town of Luweero in the Luwero region of Uganda.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

The main activities of the population are the growth of corn and potatoes and most of the population also is dedicated to raising bulls, cows, sheep and smaller cattle. \r\n<p>\r\nThe bank has been formed recently with 11 female borrowers and therefore has no history yet. It has only just started to create history in its community! The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating as of now is for investing in their businesses or for the education of their children, whether to buy school uniforms, supplies, books or paying the fee for entering primary or secondary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nMost women have small businesses that require small loans; therefore, almost all members have a 200 soles loan, with the exception of two women, who each have loans of 500 soles. The total of the loans is 2,900 soles among the 11 members.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the group\u00b4s members, Tomasa L. Auccapi\u00f1a, sells bread at the local markets. Another small business she runs is a small flour mill for wheat and other cereals. With her 200 soles loan she will be able to buy more supplies for her small store. When asked about her future, she says that her dream is the education of her children so they can be professionals and keep studying. And another dream is for her store to grow so that she will be able to move to a bigger city to run a bigger store there. With her (future) savings, she will buy more merchandise for her store. Already she has learned to be more nice in her store, to treat clients well, and to be more hygienic. She also learned about the importance of saving.\r\n<p>\r\nMarina M. C. has another story. She has a small oven to make bread. She sells the bread at local markets and sometimes in town, in her small grocery-store where she also sells fruits.  With her loan of 200 soles she will be able to buy more supplies for her business. Her dream for the future is simply to live a good life with her family and her children. She will use her savings to buy more merchandise, sell more, and then save more. Her expectations working with FINCA Peru are to learn to work harder and be more responsible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":142713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy new supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-29T03:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzmila Vicitacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daria Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adalberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-12T18:35:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":483.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208437},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":236433},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":265210},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:04:14Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294159},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":324679},{"amount":175,"local_amount":483.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":490.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357152}],"funded_date":"2008-03-29T18:35:16Z","paid_date":"2008-10-15T07:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":46255,"name":"Ngo Thi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Ng\u00f4 Th\u1ecb B\u00ednh, 55 years old, lives with her husband and their youngest child.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

For 7 years, along with her husband, she has had a business offering a taxi service.  They rent a car for this because they don't have one of their own.  Every day, her husband frequents different places in the city to offer this service, and Evelyn is in charge of administering the income to cover their family's economic needs.  Additionally, she has a stable at her home in which she raises cows and a bull.  With both of these activities, she manages to pay for the education and food costs of her small children.  Her biggest wish is to have her own car, so she can make the most of her earnings.  This is her ninth opportunity to have a credit with Microfinanzas Prisma, and during this time (almost 5 years) in her communal bank, she has proven herself to be responsible with repaying her credits.  On this occasion, she will keep demonstrating her responsibility and making her payments on time.

He is 30 years old, married, and has 4 children whose ages are 14, 10 and 5 years, and 6 months. The 3 older children go to school. Salvador has a degree in Pedagogical Sciences. He lives in his own house with his family, and also takes care of two brothers who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left Zambezia for his sister's house in Maputo in order to continue with his education. After finishing his studies at the Instituto de Magist\u00e9rio Prim\u00e1rio [Institute for Primary Education] in Matola, he began to work for the Ministry of Education as a teacher. He continues to work in the same job today, with a relatively free work schedule. He has been employed by the Ministry of Education for more than 5 years and doesn't employ anyone else to help him. He has a monthly salary of  6444.44 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He is occasionally able to save some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nSalvador had taken out loans before with another bank (Novo Banco), but he decided not to continue for various reasons. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who have also worked with the institution. This is his 1st loan, for the amount of 25,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (zinc plates, stones, cement, sand and other items) in order to continue working on his construction project. His earlier loans from Novo Banco were for 15,000.00, 25,000.00 and 38,000.00 Meticales All were repaid and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to finish his house and also to start a business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":499978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials (cement, blocks, and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-04T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvador Caetano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1135.48},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1182.15},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1230.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1281.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1388.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1445.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1505.27},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1567.14},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1631.54},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1698.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1768.39},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1841.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1995.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2077.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.15},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.72},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":126.25,"local_amount":4072.6,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4073.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128972129},{"amount":120.36,"local_amount":3882.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3883.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698691},{"amount":140.93,"local_amount":4546.23,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4547.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916162},{"amount":387.46,"local_amount":12498.53,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":12501.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159878580}],"funded_date":"2010-03-13T19:19:25Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This area is known for its lush vegetation and the fact that most people are involved in agriculture.\r\n\r\nHere we meet Mrs. Tatiana, 20, who has a common-law husband and a three-year-old son.  Her husband is a merchant.  She has been in the communal bank since the beginning and has been able to expand her business with the loans she has received through the bank.\r\n\r\nShe is a young homemaker who divides her time between taking care of the home and working.

Mwaka K. is 25 years old. She is married and has two children.  Apart from her children, she also takes care of her aged mother and three of her sister\u2019s children, since her sister is ailing. Rehema lives in Mlolongo town near the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. \r\nRehema\u2019s story is that of a woman with pure determination to succeed. After getting married she did not like idling around waiting for her husband to put food on her table. Therefore Rehema started off by saving Ksh 20 (about US$0.3) from every coin that her husband gave her to buy food for the day. She did it for 2 years until she managed to save Ksh 10,000 (US$150). With this money, Rehema rented a stall at Mlolongo for Ksh 1,000 a month. She then began to travel to rural areas where cereals are sold cheaply. She bought her first stock of cereals and started her sales business in year 2000. The business has been doing well, and now Rehema wants to expand it. She sees that the town is growing at a rapid rate, and therefore her supply may no longer be enough.          \r\nRehema is asking for a loan of US$350, so that she can purchase a weighing machine and a variety of cereals. These additions will help Rehema earn more income and enable her to better support her dependants as well as the community at large.
