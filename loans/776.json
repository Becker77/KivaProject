S. is 72 years old and lives in the Trujillo district of Trujillo province, in the La Libertad region of Peru. She belongs to the communal bank MUJERES AL PROGRESO.  This businesswoman is illiterate.  She recounts that she is from Salpo (Liberte\u00f1a mountains), and ever since she was young she has worked in the countryside caring for animals.  She comes from a family of very humble circumstances, and for this reason she had to work since she was 5 years old so her parents were not able to give her an education.  She is married, and has 4 grown children who provide her with some economic support and also help her when she is ill.  Guillermina is engaged in the business of selling food products in a grocery store that she has in her house.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is now requesting a new loan of 2.442.600 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Hong from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\n\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1.  C. T.

P. is a young man with a strong work ethic; everything he\u2019s accomplished has been due to his good behavior, discipline and self-control.  As a good citizen of Santander, at his young age he already owns a grocery store.  He lives with his father and sisters who are 13 and 23 years of age.  He came to the Caribbean coast region looking for better opportunities and started working in a bakery.  Having learned those skills, he sought to become independent.  The owner of the bakery, recognizing Richar\u2019s sense of responsibility, lent him the initial $200.000 pesos and later an additional $10.000.000 pesos.  This is how he was able to bring his father from north Santander and they began to work in their own store after the illness and death of his mother.  Currently, each tends to his business.\r\n\r\nThis is his 2nd loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He used the first one to pay down several of his debts; thanks to God everything has normalized now.  With this capital input he was able to pay cash to his suppliers which guaranteed lower prices and allowed him to be competitive in the marketplace.  This is why Richar is now applying for a $1.800.000 pesos loan; he wants to pay cash for most of his merchandise like: rice, coffee, cooking oil, canned goods, beverages and soft-drinks.\r\n\r\nHis future dream includes owning his own home, helping out his family, and carving out some free time to go to school to continue preparing himself.

Paulita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n \r\n--------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":559679,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Additional

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She chose to become a landlord because she felt that she could own this business, work full-time until it took a foothold, and still devote time to her three children. \r\n\r\nBertha realized she wanted to own rental property while sitting on the porch of her rented apartment in Houston, Texas. As she looked at the ugly fa\u00e7ade of her complex, she began to visualize the numerous ways in which the building could be improved. After a short time, she says, she had a crystal clear idea of how to turn the run-down complex into a beautiful, flourishing community.\r\n\r\nWith this dream as her motivation, Bertha decided to take a courageous leap. With only her experience as a renter as her guide, she called her landlord to discuss purchasing the complex. Six months later, Bertha was the owner of Bertha\u2019s Homes and landlord of a newly purchased community of apartments. The first thing she attended to, she says, were the immediate, smaller repairs needed on the five units in her complex. Now, she is beginning to hire companies to repair the larger, structural issues with the building such as the weak foundations and old windows.\r\n\r\nRaising a family, learning the ins and outs of a new business, and working a full-time job hasn\u2019t been easy. Bertha has had to grapple with a system of building permits and city officials, which, at one point, threatened to condemn her buildings and bankrupt her business. She says that her biggest business success to date was convincing the city that she would make the needed repairs to bring the buildings up to code. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Bertha will pay for the repairs to the major structural problems with her building. Without it, she says, she would have lost her business because, though she had enough saved for the minor repairs, she could not afford to pay the companies she hired to do the larger, most necessary ones.\r\n\r\nThough she says that every cent from her day job as a cook at a restaurant turns into a new investment in her business, Bertha remains satisfied and happy with her decision to become a landlord. She advises others to not get discouraged and to keep on trying until you have reached your goals. Getting started is the most difficult part, she says, and \u201cif a door doesn\u2019t open, it is because it\u2019s not the one that will lead you to success. That\u2019s the way I look at it.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6575,"image":{"id":803778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to

Ashur plans to repay his loan over a ten month period.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u0410\u0448\u0443\u0440, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u2013 56 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 6-\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0410\u0448\u0443\u0440 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 4 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0438 2 \u0431\u044b\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0431\u044b\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 40-45\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043a\u0438. \u0417\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u043a, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 10 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432. \u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u0430 \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f 3 \u0431\u044b\u0447\u043a\u0430.\r\n\u041a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 10 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":105053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase new livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":1730,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":33608,"name":"Lizarda","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Lizarda belongs to the Mujeres con Futuro community bank located at Jr. Arenal 1210, Calleria, Ucayali.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":216033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more food items in bulk and open a cosmetics shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T13:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Scolastica B.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T16:05:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970688},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886905},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436165},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130438},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027240},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613273},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010356},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232667},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664483},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":100439.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105228}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T15:05:18Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":74591,"name":"Jose Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Jose Mercedes habita en la Cmca.

He has been a transport driver for the past 10 years: he offers cargo services with his truck, mainly transporting livestock.  Initially he used his truck to only transport animals which he was selling but he noticed that in each village where livestock was sold, this transportation service was in high demand and so he went into this line of business.  He travels constantly from city to city, always buying products from each area to sell at his next destination.  Now, with the school year starting, it is the best time of year for him to make the greatest profit because demand for his services is so high.  Cerilo's goal is to acquire another truck to increase his profit.  This is his third loan with his community bank and MFP.  He has found the loan experience to be very satisfactory.  He will use the loan to perform maintenance on his truck, which he estimates will cost 2,300 soles, and the remainder will be used to buy second-hand goods to resell in other cities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":276455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Truck maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-22T05:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cerilo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3029.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841956}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T05:51:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":95071,"name":"Asha H.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania!

In addition, she is responsible for supporting two other dependants who are orphans. <p>\r\n\r\nSince 2003, Asha has been operating a crop-selling business.  Specifically, she purchases crops from the nearby farming village and then sells the crops in town for a profit.  She works at the business 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Asha currently earns approximately $80 per month from her business.  Now, she is requesting a loan in the amount of $400 in order to purchase more crops in bulk.  In the future, she plans to sell a wider variety of crops to further expand her business.  Asha thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.<P>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027614},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613615},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010694},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232980},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:45Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664771},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105483}],"funded_date":"2009-03-15T21:52:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":99167,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary E.'s goal is to work hard and be productive.

He is now requesting a loan in the amount of 13,000 PHP as financial assistance to his business. Domingo will utilize the loan to buy at least three sacks of feed for his hogs and some will be used to buy some farming inputs.

She is requesting to borrow from lenders a loan amounting to PHP 4,000 as additional working capital in order to maintain her hog raising business and to be able to finance the animal feed supply. Aiza also is hoping that her business will become bigger and she will be able to develop a good family with harmonious relationships, especially when they will have the children they long for, to complete their family in the future.

She lives together with her husband Ruben, who is 48 years old, and their two children, ages 18 and 8.   She would like to improve the quality of life for her children.  Running her butcher shop has provided the income Juana needs to help support her family.   She has a small stand in the Las Mercedes market, the most important market in the city of Juliaca.   She has many customers, and she is well known for the quality and freshness of the meat she sells.   What she enjoys most about her work is being able to offer advice to her customers about which cuts of meat provide the best flavor for the meals they prepare.   Juana has been doing this work for 30 years.  It is very hard work as she needs to be at her small stand all day and cannot leave.   In the future, she would like to have a larger butcher shop where she'll be better able to serve more customers.   This is Juana's third loan with MFP, and she is responsible in making timely payments, though she must save little by little.   In her communal bank, Juana is an active member and team player, winning her the respect of fellow members.

The first farming loan was repaid without problems. They grow millet, peanuts, and beans.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fatoumata Tata Sangar\u00e9 intends to use her loan to buy 3 sacks of fertilizers, 50 kg of peanut seeds, and to hire male workforce for plowing and weeding. She gets her supplies of seeds and fertilizers at the fair in S\u00e9gou (at the grand market). On her area of 2 hectares, she hopes to produce 9 sacks of peanuts, 4 sacks of millet, 300 kg of beans, and bean stalk leaves to make sheaves.\r\n\r\nBeans sheaves are stored and sold during the off-season. Part of the harvest is for their own consumption, whereas the other half is for selling. The achieved profit is used to buy food condiments on a weekly basis in fairs, and to pay for children healthcare.

During the last year Maria and her husband, Raul, have been busy running the business and raising their 10-month-old.  \r\n\r\nMaria and Raul visited several banks to try to take out a loan without success.  The last bank they tried suggested that the couple look into ACCION Texas-Louisiana as another option.  The couple is very excited to receive a loan from ACCION. \r\n \r\nThe greatest challenge for Maria has been to get the name of the business out into the community.  When customers come in they often say \u201cI didn\u2019t know you guys were here.\u201d  The loan from ACCION is extremely important for the business because it will be used for advertising expenses.  The loan is providing the finances for newspaper ads, flyers, and other types of advertisements.  Maria and her husband hope to bring in many more customers with the boost in advertising.  Maria\u2019s advice to other entrepreneurs is to \u201ctake the time and spend the money on advertising\u201d as soon as the business opens.

She earns a minimum of 250 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan.

Olinda, although married and sharing the expenses with her husband, dedicates herself to various businesses to generate enough income to cover the costs of the home and raising the children in her care \u2013 her two children and one niece.  Primarily, she occupies herself making hand-knitted clothes and sweaters, and in the purchase and sale of dairy products.  She started both endeavors recently, only about six months ago.  She learned how to make her knitwear working in a factory, where she has worked sporadically for the past two years.  She makes her products by buying the raw materials herself.  The business involving buying and selling cheeses and other dairy products occurred to her because her mother and father are jungle ranchers.  From them, she can obtain a variety of good, natural products that many people prefer to those that are manufactured such as those found primarily in her zone.  In addition, Olinda has helped out at the dining hall of her community for the past eight years, along with other women of the township and workmates from her knitting job.  Recently, only two months ago, she started taking loans with EDAPROSPO.  At 48 years of age, she would like to in the future be able to open a general store in her home to have a fixed location from which to sell her products.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":276479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of yarn for her knitwear.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T22:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda Geronima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":95,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":23.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":23.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":23.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.98,"local_amount":52.23,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":54.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084916},{"amount":45.02,"local_amount":42.77,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":45.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439284}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T22:36:32Z","paid_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":95087,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia owns a small charcoal store and call center in the Ilala neighborhood of Dodoma.

She is a local manufacturer of palm kernel oil. Palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel, which is a by-product of palm oil. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil which is used to prepare many local dishes like fried fish and pastries. Victoria produces and supplies palm kernel oil to local food vendors. She also sells Fanti kenkey and homemade loaves of bread. She has been in this business for five years now.  Her production is low because she does not have the capital to buy a processing machine and does everything manually.  She wants to use the loan to buy seventy bags of palm kernel and an electric milling machine to help produce her oil in larger quantities.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Salote has many years of experience in this business.  Salote needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 tala or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Salote joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Salote's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Salote S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines in 2006 with hope of having access to capital to start a business. She and her husband used to be partners in their retail business but as they grew older it become increasingly tiring and laborious. So four years ago when Emily received her first loan from ASHI, she constructed a fish cage in the lake. Since then her business has continued to grow and provide additional income for her family. Emily now requests her sixth loan for 30,000 pesos to use as additional capital for her fish cage business. The loan will be used to pay for more fingerlings.\r\n\r\nEmily is looking forward to increased demand for fish on the island so her business will grow and generate enough income for her family.

She is 29 years old, married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Zayda owns & operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transport services to local community members using her motorcycle. This is the main livelihood of her family, and its daily operations are overseen by Zayda's husband. Zayda has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Zayda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI, and is now requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP. It will be used  to purchased brand new tires for her motorcycle, which is crucial to her transport service. This will be Zayda\u2019s 5th loan taken from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

ready for their second loan through Esperanza International. They are very proud of themselves for fully paying their first loan and feel good about the fact that Esperanza International has rewarded their good payments with a second loan. Yanilsa V. is the group coordinator. She has two children and lives with her husband. Her children are nine and four years old. The oldest goes to school and the youngest will start in the next school year. She is a home-to-home seller of clothing and shoes. Her mother owns a convenience store so she will use the money from her second loan to set up a display in her mother\u2019s store, which will allow her to offer her products to a wider clientele. Even though right now she sells clothing, Yanilsa is a college student. She plans to major in Education, concentrating in Elementary Education. She hopes to finish her college education in order to accomplish her dream of setting up an elementary school to teach children. Yanilsa is one of the many examples of Esperanza clients who intend to use their businesses to get to a point in their future where they can give back to their communities. Yanilsa believes education can help a person have a better quality of life, which is why she wants to eventually commit her time to teaching children. On behalf of Esperanza International and the Mujeres de Gloria Bank of Hope, thank you for your

The eldest is a sophomore in high school, still undecided on a career. <p>\r\n\r\nSuzana now owns the cafeteria she has been working at since she was a child. It was passed down to her from her parents, and previously by their parents. In her cafeteria, she bakes and sells cakes, pastries, juices etc. She also specializes in baking wedding and birthday cakes.<p>\r\n\r\nThis would be Suzana's fourth loan through Esperanza. With it she plans to purchase ingredients such as flour, butter, and sugar in bulk in order to cut down on her costs, which usually scale up quickly when she buys only small amounts every few days. She hopes to continue to grow her business and improve her living conditions. When her children are old enough to go to college (the eldest in just two years) she hopes the income from her business will be able to pay for their education.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of her long term goals is to continue to push herself in order to provide a better future for her children so they won't have to go through all of the hardships she has gone

Victor's salary as a cook is just not enough to cover all of their household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn her eagerness to help her husband, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have access to loans that would enable her to start a small business. She used the PHP 3,000 first cycle loan to invest in a food vending business, selling a variety of native delicacies within her community. Happy with the results, she continued until she saved enough to put up a general store adjacent to her house, where she sold household commodities that had a fast turnover rate. She's been operating her business for four years now and it earns her an average monthly income of about $115.\r\n\r\nThe previous 6th cycle loan amounted to Php 12,000. She was able to pay her weekly installments and fully paid it within the loan term. Now for her 7th cycle she is borrowing Php 14,000 to use as revolving working capital for her business, and she also plans to invest some of the loan money into selling dried fish.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

G. is a young man of 31 years old who lives with his wife and their three kids in a community called Santa Fe located in Los Chiles, in the province of Alajuela. This community is notably a mountainous area and is close to the northern border of our country. Its principal economic activities are cattle-raising and agriculture, specifically growing basic grain staples, sugar cane and oranges.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, Don Esteban has worked with cattle, in particular the production of milk and other dairy products. He sells his products to his neighbors in the community who are very satisfied with the quality of the products he offers. \r\n\r\nRight now, Don Esteban would like a loan of \u00a2685.000 (six hundred and eighty-five thousand colones) to buy three additional cows and increase his production. He knows that having more cows will require more work and require a bigger sacrifice. Without a doubt, his desire to be a successful micro-entrepeneur and to help his family get ahead motivate him to work even harder.\r\n\r\nDon Esteban is a member of the Santa Fe Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Manantial (Manantial Community Credit Company), one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan and with the loan he hopes to improve his personal and economic situation. Also, it is clear that due to this type of organization and the convenient access to credit, he can spend more time on productive activities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":406121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Purchase of three milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-10-14T22:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":685000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228333.35},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228333.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228333.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1.87,"local_amount":1068.8,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1088.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780448},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":4,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899962},{"amount":0.28,"local_amount":161.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":164.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152035474},{"amount":1.68,"local_amount":958.1,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":975.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159750942},{"amount":396.16,"local_amount":226140.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":230326.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177391202},{"amount":2.56,"local_amount":1462.2,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1489.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529649},{"amount":398.72,"local_amount":227602.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-25T08:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":231815.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240020804},{"amount":398.72,"local_amount":227602,"processed_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":231815.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367694}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T11:05:57Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:44:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":148469,"name":"Dorcas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorcas lives in Oyo State, Nigeria.

She lives in the Inga Pirca community, which pertains to the Parish of Santa Ana.  The majority of the people of this parish work in agriculture and livestock.  Also, many of its inhabitants leave for the city in search of better work opportunities in bricklaying and home improvement.  This member is a young, single mother of 22 years old and with a six year old son, whom receives financial support from his father. She lives in her parents' home and contributes towards the household costs.  Ms. Martha coordinates the children centers of her community.  She works very few hours and doesn't have a fixed work schedule since she has to travel to far areas and must leave her home very early and return very late.  During her free time, she weaves, a skill that her mother taught her and also something she learned through weaving courses.

The couple was blessed with six children: Jilmer \u2013 24 years old, high school graduate; Ana \u2013 18 years old, also a high school graduate; Aisa \u2013 13 years old, grade six student; Angelica \u2013 11 years old, grade four; Nimfa \u2013 6 years old, a pre-school student and Shaina, three years old. The family is living in the mountainous place of Hacienda San Antonio in Ilagan, Isabela with an average standard of living. <P>\r\n\r\nAt present, Marcela is asking for financial support that she can use in her farming and hog-raising business.  She is hoping that through the loan amount of PHP 5,000 their businesses will grow.  This will also encourage them to persevere for the improvement of their livelihood and to have a better life in the future. This financial assistance will also be helpful in sending their children to school.  She believes that \u201clife is like a wheel, sometimes you\u2019re on top and sometimes at the bottom\u201d. She believes that someday they will reach the top as long as they join hands and work harder.

Margie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Margie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 24000 PHP from GDMPC. Margie is requesting a new loan of 24000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the sixth loan Margie has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20201010001) is a 27-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two children.  To make a living, M. sells bicycles in the local community.  M. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $255 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, M. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  M. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  This will be her 2nd loan from SEDA.  M. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro-finance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.

She is the mother of four children, three of whom are married and live separately while the other one attends school. \r\n\r\nMean K. has been engaged in a business weaving fishnets for more than 10 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a home that is modest, but very cozy, that he built himself out of wood.  Roberto cultivates cocoa and bananas in the village of Triboline, located in the Huanta district.  For 30 years he has worked alone in the fields.  From 6 in the morning, at daybreak, Roberto begins his routine life: tilling, watering, and ensuring that pests do not harm his crops.

He loves to work on his farm, because he really enjoys the natural setting.  But at times he gets angry if his hired workers don't do the work correctly, as he would like them to do it. Now he is content and tranquil, because he knows that the sale of his crops is profitable.  Cocoa is marketed in the collection centers in his town, while he sends his bananas to the city of Ayacucho, where he has customers that wait for the arrival of his quality fruit.  In the future, he plans to buy more agricultural land to increase his production and improve his sales.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he assures us that he will not fall behind on his payments because he does not want to let down his communal bank, since they gave him the confidence to work together.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo es la falta de capital de trabajo,  para dar respuesta r\u00e1pida a sus clientes  y esto es lo que justamente conseguir\u00e1 con su credikiva:  un capital nuevo para comprar de contado y en volumen,  mercanc\u00edas como art\u00edculos para el hogar, adornos navide\u00f1os, regalos de amor y amistad, todo esto teniendo en cuenta,  que es el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o y se acerca una \u00e9poca de gran despliegue de ventas y Yolbin sabe que es tiempo de repunte de ventas. ","en":"Yolbin is 34 years old and lives to the south of the city with her husband and two children (ages 18 and 10).  She has a store where she sells various merchandise, but she also offers products through specialty catalogs of major companies.  When she started her business, Yolbin was excited about being able to help with the household expenses and achieve greater well-being.  She began selling shoes, but later added products through catalogs.  As a result, she built up her own capital which she used to increase her sales.  Today she also has a display case on the terrace of her house and shelves where she can show off the products that she sells.  Her goal moving forward is to convert her variety shop into a large store where current and potential customers can come to buy everything they need and want.  The main products that she sells are perfumes, cosmetics, cards, miscellaneous items, and household appliances by request.  Yolbin takes into account what is lacking in her displays.  Her main suppliers are the warehouses in the central part of the city and the specialty catalogs that frequently advertise good promotional offers.  Her business is managed by her uncle since she works at a part-time job in the mornings to earn income.  In the afternoons, Yolbin takes over her business.  Competition is high, but there is much public demand to generate income for all the businesses.  Her greatest challenge is the lack of operating capital that would enable her to respond quickly to her customers.  This is exactly why she is applying for a Kiva loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nHaving this new capital will enable her to buy merchandise with cash and in bulk such as household goods, Christmas decorations, and gifts for Colombian Valentine\u2019s Day.  Yolbin is taking into consideration that this is the second half of the year when a large number of products are introduced to sell.  Therefore, she should see a spike in sales.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":864514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

","en":"Don Juan Rafael, age 58, was born in Le\u00f3n, is single, and is the owner of general store. He only reached the second grade. \r\n\r\nHe started his business nine years ago. Regretful of not having any children of his own, he does have some nieces who he helped raise and who have helped him to set up his store. He makes a living through this business, given that at his age it's quite difficult to get other work. That's why he wound up establishing his humble store, which is small but offers kind and welcoming service. He needs this loan to buy rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, milk, eggs, juice, soft drinks, butter, meat, canned foods, sweets, soaps, detergents, and bleach. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to someday build his store into a general distributor supplying everything needed to meet the basic needs of his neighborhood. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":901507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, milk, eggs, juice, soft drinks, butter, meat, canned foods, sweets, soaps, detergents, and bleach. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T20:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":439.61,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.01,"local_amount":87.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":90.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832674},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242593},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381866},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095409},{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":44.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710039},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403479},{"amount":68.25,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":68.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428434},{"amount":66.75,"local_amount":65.21,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":66.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613170}],"funded_date":"2011-12-09T08:41:12Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacob Bintliff","image":789150}},{"id":354145,"name":"Leybin Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leybin Guadalupe tiene 25 a\u00f1os, su actividad es un kiosco hace tiempo que tiene este medio de vida.

Emilia creates clothing for women such as lingerie and underwear for children. She began the business with financial support that was enough to buy her first sewing machine that she set up in her own home.\n\nHer first customers were her relatives but little by little she won more clients among her friends and neighbors, thanks to the good work she learned from her sister 15 years ago. Currently she is studying in a vocational training center in order to become perfect. \n\nWhat she likes about her work is being able to focus and remain busy permitting her to have income, in order to give a better quality of life to her family. On the other hand, what bothers her is the physical fatigue from being in the same position for many hours, but this does not dishearten her and she hopes to be able to open a boutique in her own home.\n\nThis will be her first loan with MFP, therefore she is waiting for assistance, in order to continue with her plans and she promises to make her payments on time, once again, in order to have a good credit record. She likes being a part of the communal bank because all the people are trustworthy and very supportive.\n\nWith the 1000 soles from the loan she will buy a new sewing machine costing 700 soles and the balance will be used to buy sewing supplies such as fabrics, thread, and other items.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":935547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine and supplies such as fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-06T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":148.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":158.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":158.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":172.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":179.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":183.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":148.06,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":149.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836256},{"amount":59.57,"local_amount":158.85,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":160.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246017},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":158.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":159.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386044},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":172.15,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":174.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099133},{"amount":136.07,"local_amount":362.85,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":367.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713293}],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T18:48:41Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":370533,"name":"Pov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pov is 40 years old,  married, and has two children.

She is married and her husband's name is Ladislao Cespedes.  They have 5 children and they all go to school which is about 8 blocks from their home.<p>\r\nShe makes chipas and she sells them by travelling all around the neighborhoods in different cities.  Chipa is a traditional food and very popular in Paraguay.  It's similar to bread and it's made out of starch, cheese, milk, vegetable oil, etc.  She has a small shop in her home where she makes her chipas and her family help her make around 200 chipas a day.  The cities where she makes most of her money are San Lorenzo and Fernando de la Mora which are located one hour away from Caacupe.<p>\r\nMarta tells us that with this job, she and her husband have been able to have a roof over their head, provide food for their family and provide an education to their children.  Lately sales have been low and to be able to sell all her chipas, Marta has to walk all around town until she sells all her chipas because if she doesn't sell them then she doesn't make money.<p>\r\nShe also tells us that she went to many different lending institutions to try to get a loan, but nobody was willing to let her borrow money since she doesn't have many references\/credentials.  Fundacion Paraguaya was the only one who helped her to get a loan .  Thanks to that loan she was able to build a brick oven because previously she was renting her neighbor's brick oven to make her chipas.<p>\r\nAt this time she is requesting a loan to purchase main ingredients such as eggs, milk, starch and cheese.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Marta, tiene 41 a\u00f1os, ella es casada, su marido se llama Ladislao C\u00e9spedes y tienen 5 hijos; todos van a la escuela que queda a 8 cuadras de su domicilio.\r\nElla elabora y vende chipas de forma ambulante, recorriendo barrios de diferentes ciudades.

They are all businesswomen in Makeni, the northern provincial headquarters town. They have been together as a group with SMT for the past year. Previously, SMT loaned these women Le 600,000.00 each. This they have repaid successfully and are now requesting a new loan. \r\nThe previous loan had a lot of impact on their lives but they still need more loans to further empower themselves in their businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nTheir leader is Fatmata F.. Fatmata was born here in Makeni 25 years ago. She is married with two school-going children. Both she and her husband, who is a teacher, are responsible for their children's schooling and welfare. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough her cotton trade, Fatmata is able to meet most of her financial needs. She has been in the cotton business for the past two years now. Fatima is doing fine in her business, but still faces a lot of challenges.

She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $125 that she will use for her vending business.  Violeta is also planning to start in the hog raising business if she ever has extra money.  She dreams that her younger children will finish their studies and have a better job in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe has seven children: Rosemarie, thirty-one years old and a high school graduate; Rodel, twenty-nine years old and a high school undergraduate; Romalyn, twenty-three years old and in college; Rosel, twenty-one years old and a nursing student; Roby-Ann, eighteen years old and a high school graduate; Jenny Mae, seventeen years old and a high school student; and Richelle, the youngest, is twelve years old and presently in elementary school.

She practically inherited the sales post from her father and since then she wakes up before dawn everyday and at 3 in the morning she starts to list what she needs to buy at the wholesale market, leaving her children in the care of her husband. With her profits she has started building a second floor on the home given to her by her mother-in-law, and also help out with family expenses like the water and electric bill. Maria tells us this is very tough work but it has its rewards, so she works a lot and in the future she would like to buy a car that she can use for a taxi service.

She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Ivapene has 5 years of experience in this business.  Ivapene needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase used sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ivapene joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ivapene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ivapene L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.
