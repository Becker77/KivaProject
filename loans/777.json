She is 43 years old. Monica is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMonica is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Monica owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Monica has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Monica joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Monica has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Monica is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP for the same purpose. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Monica from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":601806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

In this place he operates his business, a leather goods shop where he makes purses. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, Alex began his first experience with the market and entrepreneurship, selling puddings from store to store. In the course of this activity, he met a woman who taught him how to make purses. Alex was very interested in learning, and because of this he practiced the skill with great frequency at this lady's home, ultimately moving in with her and working with her on an ongoing basis. They strove to get ahead, each with their own business, but united in the effort to achieve well-being in their household. Now, Alex's business is 10 years old, and his purses are sold in the cities of Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Cartagena, three stars of the Caribbean Sea which nestle by the beaches along the coast. He has 3 employees, including the man who cuts the leather, the designer and the man who glues the pieces. He was previously located in the downtown area of Soledad, but since 1 year ago he has been working in a neighborhood of the municipality, closer to Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to expand into new markets, so he can see his children become prosperous and provide them with chances for success, helping them to become professionals. In the meantime, he is continuing to work with dedication and looking for ways to increase his working capital in order to serve his growing customer base. For this reason, he applied for a Kiva loan, his first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use the loan to buy a sewing machine and raw materials to manufacture a range of products, because he plans to expand his production and enter the markets in Sincelejo and Valledupar, other cities of the coastal region. Alex's financial status is consistent with the business he operates, and it reflects the good times his business is experiencing. His sales cover all expenses and give a consistent net profit margin of no less than 6.85%, while his accounts receivable turn over every 5 days and inventory every 20.  \r\n

It usually happens before school holidays ends or before the Hindu festivals. At fist Dwi was only a helper to her mother in law to sew, but now she has many customers. She invested Rp 1.000.000 to buy a sewing machine to help her working faster. She earns Rp.50.000,- as income, and use it to support her family living, for they have had a 6 moths old baby.

Bermacam-macam baju bisa dijahitnya seperti kebaya, baju seragam sekolah dan lain-lain. Dwi mulai menjahit dari pagi sampai sore hari, kalau orderannya banyak Dwi bisa lembur sampai malam hari. Biasanya hal ini terjadi pada saat akan memasuki tahun ajaran sekolah yang baru atau menjelang hari raya. Awalnya hanya sekedar membantu mertuanya tetapi sekarang berkembang karena pelangganya semakin banyak. Jadi dengan modal awal Rp 1.000.000 Dwi membeli mesin jahit agar pekerjaanya bisa lebih cepat selesai. Keuntungan yang diperoleh sebesar Rp.50.000,- Keuntungan ini dipakai untuk memenuhi kebutuhannya karena Dwi sudah punya anak yang baru berumur 6 bulan. Suaminya,  I Putu Wiartika, yang bekerja sebagai buruh bangunan sangat mendukung pekerjaan istrinya. Harapan Dwi dari pinjaman yang diperoleh dari Dinari  bisa mengembangkan usahanya menjadi lebih besar lagi dan memiliki keinginan untuk menambah jumlah tenaga kerja dan bisa menerima orderan lebih banyak

Married mothers of at least 8 children, they are on average 50 years old and are either related to each other or neighbors. They sell clothes, shoes, and jewelry. In order to rectify not having enough funds for their business, the members of the Kokadi\u00e8 group turned to Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program five years ago. The loan amount has gone from 50,000 CFA francs at the first loan to 125,000 CFA francs for the twelfth group loan. The current loan will be used to buy in-style clothes and jewelry at wholesale to be resold. The women of the Kokadi\u00e8 group stock up at the market in Bamako (the capital of the republic of Mali). They sell their products at the large market in Koutiala where they have space (kiosks or a converted shed). With this new loan, they plan on earning 140,000 CFA francs each over the term. In addition to repaying the loan, they will use a portion of their profits to pay for the needs of their family and the schooling of their children. In the near future, they plan to seek individual loans to open a clothing boutique.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":299692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase clothing and jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":254034.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621181},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020141},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242896},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678579},{"amount":258.35,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112519}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T07:33:58Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":104123,"name":"Vaofetu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vaofetu F., 47, is married with five children.

Because of her need to contribute to the household income, and motivated by herself, she launched her own general store with her 300.00 PEN loan. She obtained great results from the beginning because of her high-quality products, her reasonable prices, and her excellent customer service. She still runs this same business, which is located in her house. Her main customers are her neighbors. With this 1,600.00 PEN loan, she will purchase more products to stock her shop with rice and sugar by the kilo, crates of eggs, personal hygiene products, household cleaning supplies, crates of soft drinks, candy, and other products to keep her customers satisfied. She now feels very happy with the work and service that she provides, and she gives thanks to Manuela Ramos for giving support to people like her who want to work and get ahead in life.

When she began, it was because of the need to support her family and get ahead.  Her sons' work consists in buying and selling cattle and it produces good profits.  This is her second loan with the institution and she plans to buy clothing, irons, and blenders to deliver to her customers since she sells them on credit and the appliances she only sells on order since they are more expensive.  With this she expects to increase sales, gather more customers and continue to improve her finances.  All of this is thanks to Afodenic's help with the financing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":427931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of clothing, an iron, to increase sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T23:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glenda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":1559.78,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1564.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601779},{"amount":151.49,"local_amount":3127.62,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3136.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003224},{"amount":49.13,"local_amount":1014.23,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874294},{"amount":60.65,"local_amount":1252.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1255.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604192},{"amount":66.39,"local_amount":1370.63,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639654},{"amount":65.41,"local_amount":1350.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1354.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821430},{"amount":306.38,"local_amount":6325.13,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6343.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561444}],"funded_date":"2009-12-13T17:57:09Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":157577,"name":"Los Jazmines Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La alcanc\u00eda comunal \u201cLOS JAZMI.\u201d se encuentra ubicada en la parte alta de Huayc\u00e1n distrito de Ate departamento de Lima, vienen trabajando con EDAPROSPO \u2013 Prosperidad desde hace 5 meses, la alcanc\u00eda comunal est\u00e1  conformada por 11 socios quienes desempe\u00f1an diferentes tipos de actividades como: producci\u00f3n, comercio y  servicio, la cual est\u00e1 representada por: \nM.

S. is a tough and determined widow who has the responsibility of taking care of their three children. Her eldest is 21, the middle one is 19 and the youngest is 17 years old. All her children finished only high school because she does not have the capacity to send them to college because of the expensive fares required to going in and out of the island where they live. Some of her children already have a family of their own. \r\n\r\nShe joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines. As a member, she makes sure that her loans are invested properly and she performs her duties and responsibilities diligently. For almost five years she has been buying and selling dried fish. Aside from the fish caught by her children, she will buy fresh fish from the fishermen and dry them. She will then pack the fish in kilos and sell them to the market and to her frequent customers. She is applying for a loan of PHP 25,000 for additional capital for her dried fish business and to finance the plan of her eldest son to put up a locally known fish trap called \"skylab\" that is made up of fish net and bamboo poles positioned in the allowed fishing area of the lake. Income generated from this business will be used to renovate their house and for the daily consumption of her children and grandchildren. She is hoping that KIVA lenders will help them in this venture.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Magdalena, a hard-working, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Kericho area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Magdalena is the proud mother of six lovely children that she really loves and adores and always protects. Magdalena\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and because of this she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of the poverty situation. That is why she started farming 10 years ago and through farming she has been able to earn a decent income. Magdalena is the breadwinner in her family and this really pushes her to work hard so that her six children will have a bright future and also her parents will have a comfortable life. Magdalena is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture business. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Kericho but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Magdalena is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. Through the income from horticultural farming, Magdalena will assure her children of a bright future and she will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her.

She has a small grocery store in her home and has sold basic grains, fruits, and vegetables there for the past eight years.  She started her business with small loans and has continued to invest in her store in order to sell more products.  She cannot sell meats because she doesn\u2019t have a refrigerator in which to keep them; she only has a small cooler that Pepsi gave her, which allows her to sell soft drinks and other small products.  Her house is small, the walls are not made of concrete, and she doesn\u2019t have privacy, and because she doesn\u2019t have additional space for storing her products she has to put them in the living room.  Zaida has two children, both of whom go to school in the neighborhood and help her in the afternoon, since their mother is a very hardworking woman who, as a single mother, attends to all of their needs.  She will use this loan to purchase fruits, vegetables, rice, beans, oil, soft drinks, and candies so that she can improve her sales a bit more.  She hopes that before long she can build a small addition to her house that would be more visible from the street, since this would help her improve her sales and would also free up more space in her home.  Zaida is grateful to Kiva partner Afodenic for the funding, since she has been able to satisfy her small children\u2019s needs and has managed to get ahead.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":427957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing rice, beans, sugar, fruits, and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T01:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaida Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":1035.59,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1072.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003227},{"amount":48.22,"local_amount":964.41,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":998.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841382},{"amount":50.04,"local_amount":1000.84,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874297},{"amount":49.96,"local_amount":999.16,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604194},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639656},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821432},{"amount":200,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4141.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561445}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T06:02:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":157593,"name":"Celsa Arelis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Celsa B. se dedica a la venta de bebidas como jugos y gaseosas en el departamento de Chinandega en el mercado El Bisne donde diariamente ofrece sus bebidas en la terminal de buses con el prop\u00f3sito de buscar la manera de c\u00f3mo mejorar las condiciones de su actividad y llevar el sustento a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n compuesta por su hijo ya que ella es madre soltera y debe brindarle las condiciones para que este peque\u00f1o estudie.

She saved the income she received so she could open a new business and 5 years ago started up a package store.

It is also packed hot into a Styrofoam box and sold in the streets, mostly recognized by the honking of the bicycle boy who carries and sells them.

This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, with which she intends to buy inventory of general store products so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her only child. She also hopes that it will improve her business.

O. is a married man. His wife is a business-lady and they have seven children aged between twenty-nine years old and fifteen years old. He owns a bicycle which he uses to provide transport services. His target market is comprised of fishmongers in the area, ice bar suppliers and other local walk-in customers. He is located at the heart of Kisumu Municipal Fish Market where there are many people thus many customers to serve. \r\n\r\nGeorge has been in business for seven years now. His business is profitable, but his major challenge is financial constraints. He also says that during the rainy season business is usually low because many people prefer closed vehicles since they are sheltered from cold and rain.

Richar, empez\u00f3 su aventura como agricultor desde muy ni\u00f1o en las tierras de sus padres. Su pasi\u00f3n  por el agro lo llev\u00f3 adquirir sus propias tierras donde viene trabajando 10 a\u00f1os de manera independiente; espacio donde cultiva caf\u00e9 y hojas de coca; en total posee 04 hect\u00e1reas y media de terreno. En tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los jornaleros quienes se encargan de extraer con mayor rapidez los frutos de cada producto, de esa manera logra avanzar con mayor celeridad. Se siente muy comprometido con su labor; porque  gracias a su esfuerzo cotidiano hoy disfruta al ver los frutos bien desarrollados, en consecuencia obtiene buenas ganancias por cada kilogramo de producto vendido. Asimismo menciona que la  estaci\u00f3n de invierno no es de su agrado porque en ese tiempo abundan los insectos y las precipitaciones de las lluvias, impidiendo el rendimiento de su trabajo y perjudicando a los frutos de sus plantaciones.

Mas adelante tiene pensado comprar nueras tierras y sembrar plantas de barbasco, ya que los inversionistas coreanos empezaran a tratar estas plantas en las tierras del distrito de Santa Rosa. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, esta dispuesto a pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente, ya que desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito m\u00e1s adelante.

He is a cheerful, hard working young man living together in his own house with Luisa, 25, and their two children: Juan, 3 and Luis, 1.\n\nRichar started his farming adventure while still a child in his parents\u2019 fields.  His passion for agriculture led him to acquire his own land where he\u2019s been working independently for ten years.  He farms coffee and coca leaf.  In total, he has four and a half hectares of land.\n\nDuring harvest time he hires laborers to help with the work in order extract the most fruit quickly and get ahead faster.  He feels very committed to his work because thanks to his daily efforts he is able to see his fruit develop well which leads to good profits on every kilogram sold.\n\nIn addition, he mentions that he does not much enjoy the winter season because insects abound and rain is frequent which impedes his work and damages fruit.\n\nRichar plans to start a new kind of business and invest his savings plus the money he got from MFP to start selling home appliances.  Later on he plans to buy more land to plant barbasco (hardwood shrub) plants because Korean investors have begun to deal in these plants in the district of Santa Rosa.\n\nThis is his first loan with MFP and he\u2019s willing to repay all his installments punctually because he\u2019d like to access another future loan.  At the same time, he feels committed to the institution because it provided the loan.\n\nHe will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy home appliances because this will be his new business.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":738389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy home appliances.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-26T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Richar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":135.53},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":142.65},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":143.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":156.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":169.23},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":174.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":181.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":186.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":193.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":200.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.04,"local_amount":278.73,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":280.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270111},{"amount":51.84,"local_amount":143.01,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":144.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718805},{"amount":56.02,"local_amount":154.54,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350271},{"amount":56.69,"local_amount":156.39,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":157.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850754},{"amount":58.74,"local_amount":162.05,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":163.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714198},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":252.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203168},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":252.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402122},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":252.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456612},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":252.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452394},{"amount":38.19,"local_amount":105.28,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:18Z","rounded_local_amount":106.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315447775}],"funded_date":"2011-04-01T16:40:55Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:40:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":289372,"name":"Mary Gold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Gold S., 36, is married and has five children, three of whom are in school.\r\n\r\nMary Gold is a vegetable farmer in the Philippines.

of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in monogamous households, all residing in the Filabougou quarter of Ouelessebougou (Koulikoro, Mali).  They are known to one another by ties of kinship and proximity.

With this loan of approximately $55 (25,000 XOF) per member, they intend to buy 150 kilograms of fruit, 60 cans of drinks and various other articles.

She is 50 years old, and lives in her own house with her 2 children, Vanesa, 27, and Max, 20.  She has worked hard to succeed and improve her life.  Luz manages one of the busiest restaurants in the city of Puno, \"El Rancho\".  It is a very well decorated location with a pleasant atmosphere, located on the banks of Lake Titicaca, with a diverse menu and delicious food, where the customers do nothing but compliment the cook's seasoning.

Nelda is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP to buy more of the ingredients she needs to make products to sell. This loan, her first from HSPFI, will allow her to generate additional income to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Irina is 37 years old. She is married and the loving mother of two children. Irina owns a successful clothing sales business at the market of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. She has been doing this business for about 10 years. Her business has benefited from a good sales location and constant demand for her products. \r\n\r\nIrina tries to offer good prices to her customers while still making a profit. She has requested a loan of 1500 USD to increase her product inventory. By purchasing additional inventory, Irina will be better prepared to meet increased demand and earn a good income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She supplies the fans to different cities but in Multan specifically because this is the city that is renowned for hand-made items.\r\n  \r\nHer husband runs a cold-drink corner, where he sells different brands of cold drinks such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and 7-Up. He also supplies those bottles to others cold-drink corners. He has more than 15 years of experience in this field. \r\n\r\nSughran is the mother of a son and two daughters who couldn\u2019t get an education due to poor financial conditions. \r\n\r\nSughran has applied for a loan from Asasah to help her husband financially. With the loan amount, her husband will buy bottles to fulfill larger orders on time. She prays to God that in this way, her husband\u2019s income may increase more. \r\n\r\nShe is in her third loan cycle and is a responsible loan user of Asasah. In the past two years of loan experience, she has maintained good credit behavior and never missed a meeting.\r\n\r\nNote: In this photo, all the ladies are holding the hand-made fans made by Sughran, the group leader."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":585925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All these challenges led her to decide to become a GHAPE member in 2008. In this same year, she received her first loan of 40,000 XAF, which she repaid promptly. \r\n<br>With this loan of 200,0000 XAF, Julie plans to buy seven tines of corn, five tines of beans, four tines of garri, and five buckets of coco yams. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. Julie is sure that her business will succeed because she has been doing it for a long time, has a good business location, and a lot of customers. Her neighbors are happy to buy from her because the distance they have to travel to market is reduced, and they can buy from her late at night. She plans to use her profits to invest back into the business, look after her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her children. She prefers loans from Kiva partner, GHAPE, because of the social services GHAPE offer and the convenient method of repayment.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b><br>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and her two children.\r\n\r\nZoila is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and improved her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy rices, flour and other foods. Her business is a \"colmado\" - a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food. Normally colmados such as this are in the same neighborhood, or within a short walk, from any home. She will use the profits to change her house from wood to concrete blocks so as to give a safer home to her family. She thanks you all for your support.

venture whose weekly profits add up to 140,000 shillings. With enough resourcefulness and a sense of purpose, a certain 45-year-old married father of five, going by the name of K. Pascoli, has found himself in this enviable position for the last twenty-five years In Kyaliwajjala, Mukono.\r\n\r\nPascoli\u2019s shoemaking and sales business has, in a way, propelled him to some considerable financial glory, notwithstanding the fact that he, in most cases, faces problems of shortage of shoemaking materials. This has often been his biggest undoing.

When she joined the ranks of the growing number of unemployed in Floresville, this mother of seven children realized that her dream of starting her own business was now the most practical alternative. Santana\u2019s Party Supplies started out as a pi\u00f1ata store, but quickly grew into a general party supply store, renting out chairs, tables, moonwalks and water slides. \r\n\r\nTheir current inventory is insufficient to meet the public\u2019s demand for wedding decorations. Therefore, Carlotta and Daniel are going to use this loan to buy white chairs and tables, arches, columns, and other wedding decorations to rent out. Previously, they had sub-leased these items from party supply stores in San Antonio and barely made a profit. Now, they will be able to avoid the commute to San Antonio and have wedding decorations readily available for customers. \r\n\r\nA constant challenge is the competition of large big-box stores like Wal-Mart. The Fites overcome this challenge by maintaining competitive prices and building relationships with their customers. The couple eventually plans to open up more party supply businesses in southern Texas and give a business to each of Carlotta's children.

For the last 16 years, Mahbuba has made a living selling fabrics used in the making of her country's national dresses, which are an important item in the dowry of any young woman. She is known for providing outstanding service and selling well-made, carefully-chosen merchandise at good prices. She buys her fabrics in the neighboring city Khujand, where she regularly searches for items that meet her customers' needs. She is applying for a loan to expand her business because her children are growing up and her expenses are rising. She plans to use this loan for TJS 13,000 to buy more items to sell, and thanks Kiva lenders for their generous support. She promises to repay the loan on time.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being the home of a key post along the Silk Road and the place where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 45 years old. Rosalinda is married and has 4 adult-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when she sells one of her raised hogs.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell in future. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Rosalinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

At the beginning stages of her business, she rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for her because the middleman could dismiss her at any time. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2006, Ms. Orkhontuya had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make her business more stable. As a result of her hard work, today she has 1,200,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT) in her working capital and she sells her handmade clothes and clothes imported from China.\r\n\r\nOrkhontuya is requesting a loan of 1,000,000 MNT. With this loan, she wants to purchase clothing materials and then she will sew spring clothes and women\u2019s coats. Her long term objective is to build her own house where her family can have better living conditions.

She lives in the company of Ra\u00fal, her husband of 11 years.  They have 3 children, who they care for in their own house, which is located in the Conopa annex.  As responsible parents, they hope to give their children a good education.  And so they rented a room in the city of Huancayo where the children can study.  They take on all their responsibilities together, as partners.  Carmen's husband works in transportation using the car he owns.  His route is very long, and so sometimes it takes an entire day for him to get back home.  He earns a minimum of 100 soles a day.  They are still finishing up paying off the car, which took a lot of effort to purchase.  Carmen, on the other hand, makes her living in agriculture.  She plants potatoes, beans, corn and peas on her own land.  She sells her produce after each harvest in Acostambo's market.  In addition, she raises a lot of cows and pigs which she fattens to later sell to the butchers who visit the area.  For now, she hopes to improve her profits and finish paying off the car, which is her primary concern.  Carmen belongs to the communal bank \u201cConopa,\u201d and this is her third loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will receive the help that she really needs.  In addition, she encourages responsibility in the association, which is why she promises to be punctual in making her payments.  Carmen will start with her plantings, and once she receives the support, she will invest the money in the purchase of a bull to plow the land.  She currently has one bull, but she needs two.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":912090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a bull.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-07T18:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":318.66,"local_amount":849.75,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":862.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097887},{"amount":131.34,"local_amount":350.25,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":355.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402135}],"funded_date":"2011-11-07T20:19:57Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":359104,"name":"Muungano A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacob is the facilitator of the Muungano A group.

Peter is a friendly member of the community with 2 children. Peter lives with his family in a house made of mud walls, dirt floor, and an iron roof.\n\nGod Bondo B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Kabongo spring. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Peter\u2019s family, as well as the 40 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nPeter has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Peter volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help the community prevent sicknesses related to unsafe water. There are also two other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: Jane and Dickness.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Peter\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805208,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peter ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dickness ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1763,"name":"Afi Lawo\u00e8","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. A.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":388508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cereals in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T17:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023055},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868296},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:23Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757492},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146586},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984731},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":70659.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015404}],"funded_date":"2009-09-15T22:24:34Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":141116,"name":"Gena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gena C. is from the village of Militar, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur.

She owns a business venture, raising pigs for sale.  Faatoaga  has 5 years of experience in this business.  Faatoaga  needs a loan of WST $1250 to build shelter for the borrower's livestock.  She plans to use the earnings from her business  to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faatoaga  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faatoaga 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faatoaga  M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

(aged 9 and 12), and a very supportive husband. Before she became a member of ASHI in 2009, she devoted her time to taking care of her children and attending to the needs of her family. She would make sure that, when her husband came home from working in the rice field all day, a meal was prepared that they would share on their small table. However, there would be times when she had nothing to prepare because her husband, being the sole provider and a hired farm laborer, had a small and sporadic income. Melecia aspired to have her own business and to play an economically productive role as well as raising children. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, with the support of her husband, she joined ASHI and requested a loan. She started a hog fattening and a rice retail business. With her business she was able to augment her husband\u2019s income and their lives have now improved a bit. Melecia is now requesting a much larger loan to really grow her business and profits. She wishes to raise more hogs and to sell large volumes of rice from their house. Someday she hopes to have enough business capital to build a store, separate from their house, where she can sell grocery items and rice to increase her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":519684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

J. has run a charcoal business for two years.  \r\n\r\nCharcoal is important in Tanzania, because it is used for cooking in almost every home and restaurant.  J. leaves Dar Es Salaam to travel to the countryside, where he spends 5-6 days making charcoal from trees that he harvests.  He returns to the city with his product and sells it to wholesale and retail buyers.  \r\n\r\nJ. paid back his previous two loans from Tujijenge Tanzania, and will use this loan to expand his business.  He wants to hire more laborers to help him produce the charcoal, which will allow him to organize up to 15 sacks per trip.  He currently yields around ten sacks.  This should increase his profit, which is currently 320,000 Tsh (around $228) per month.

It is made up of eight women, all of whom are married and have at least five children. They have an average age of 50 and have been working together for over three years. Their main activities are raising cattle and\/or sheep, processing and selling peanut oil and local grain. The location of the village is advantageous to the group members and village women in general because many weekly markets are held nearby. So, on average, the women travel to the markets to sell their goods four days out of seven. This loan that they have been granted will allow them to buy steers and small ruminant animals to rear, as well as peanuts and local grain for their small-scale business. \r\n\r\nDue to the death of a family member, Siga S. was not present when the photo was taken, so she is not in it.\r\n\r\nFatou Elhadj D., standing on the right in the second row, is 48 years old and she has seven children. She conducts various business activities, such as selling peanut oil and local grain, as well as raising sheep.

As for the small-scale business, she will run it on the income she has made from her previous business activities. Her aim is to play a part in taking care of her children's needs, especially their schooling.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":561803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To strengthen the finances of this community support group","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Diourbel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-06-30T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou Elhadj0154","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Diouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khole","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diouma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thioro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":860000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":860000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1625,"local_amount":860000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T10:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":860883.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182518004}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T00:04:56Z","paid_date":"2011-01-08T10:40:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":215659,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to cover personal household expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-07-22T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2010-07-22T13:20:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":219755,"name":"Ceralyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ceralyn D. is from the village of Bularan, Miputak.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Erma has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Erma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erma is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Erma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The official name of this borrowing group is \u00d4 C\u00e1ch 1 nh\u00f3m 04  (Nh\u00f3m 04).\n\n\nQ. is married and has two school-aged children. Q. owns & operates a business venture manufacturing furniture. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from making & selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Q. has been in business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 VND a month.\n\n\nIn 2009, Q. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Q. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to expand product offerings.  She is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND, which will be used to purchase wood as material to expand her production scale.  This will be Q.'s third loan from SEDA.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nQ.
