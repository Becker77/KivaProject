She is a widow and resides in the small town of Toktogul on her own. Three of her kids are already grown and live separately. The business story of this lady started in 2005, when she received a loan of 60 000 soms from a local bank and bought 11 head of livestock. That became a turning point in her family budget. \r\n\r\nGradually she learnt more and more about care of livestock and efficient ways of selling her animals. Soon the profit helped her purchase more head of livestock. Now Maksuda\u2019s herd is one of the largest ones in the neighborhood. A monthly income of 2 000 soms helped her repay the loan successfully. Since she has experience in taking out loans she is sure to repay the loan from Kiva, too. She requests the loan for the purchase of more head of cattle. Her biggest wish is to help her son financially in finishing the construction of his house. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Francisca is a 43-year-old native of Monterrey, New Leon, and she has, along with her husband, dedicated herself for 20 years to the daily production and sale of bread. Her bakery business, which also employs her husband and daughter, is the only source of income for her family. It was more than 20 years ago when Francisca recognized the necessity to generate an income to support her children; she decided to start selling bread. She first began production in small quantity. Then, little by little she acquired her gas ovens, which allowed her to increase her production and to convert her business into a supplier of bread to grocery stores. She also produces cakes for children\u2019s parties, fifteenth birthday celebrations, and weddings. With the help of her van she also sells bread on the streets of the community.<p>Right now she seeks a loan of 1,100 dollars with the aim of buying a higher-capacity mixer, facilitating an increase in production and, hence, growth. She intends to pay back this loan within 3 to 6 months.

He began the business in February 1984 from an inheritance from his grandfather and from his mother.  Since they dedicated their entire lives to this business, he took advantage of their relationships and experience to continue doing the same thing.  He has progressed a lot since each time he has more customers and he has been able to hire three salesmen who sell in different parts of the city.  In addition to selling in the streets, he has many customers who make orders to decorate their children's parties, so he doesn't regret dedicating himself to this activity.  He needs a loan of $12,000 MXN that he will repay in 12 installments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

P. is a 58 year-old married woman with one adult child who is now helping her in their business. Consolacion and her family live in Prk. Pag-asa, Poblacion 2, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. In spite of her advancing years, Consolacion works hard so that she can continue to earn a good living for her family, not only for their immediate needs, but also for when she and her husband are old and no longer able to work for a living. Consolacion also hopes that by sustaining a stable business now, her child will be able to continue with the business in the future.\r\n\r\nConsolacion started her RTW (ready-to-wear clothes) business in 1975 to have a stable source of income for their small family. This was her only source of income for many years, then at some point, she had to shift to another business venture because the RTW business was not doing as well. So she invested in a food vending business making specialty rice-cakes called \"bibingka\", made with rice flour, coconut, and sugar, and cooked on a top-fired oven.  When RTW became in demand again, Consolacion shifted back to her RTW business, selling clothes from a rented stall in the Sagay City Central Market.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, she again experienced some financial difficulties as some of her capital had to be spent on the tuition fees of her child who was at the time attending college. But her cash flow problem was solved when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon where she was able to borrow the necessary capital to sustain her business operations, and, as the years passed, has allowed her to expand her product lines with access to bigger loans because of her good credit record. Consolacion earns an average of PHP 30,000 monthly from her RTW business, and she saves a majority of this amount towards her \"retirement fund\" so that she and her husband will not be a burden to their child in later years.\r\n\r\nConsolacion's previous loan of PHP 19,000 was used to buy new stock for their business and she was able to pay that loan as usual without any problems. Now for her 11th loan cycle, she is borrowing the same amount so that she can continue to restock her store with new fashions for her customers.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":435599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb (10102090016) is a 34 year-old woman who lives in the town of \u0110\u00f4ng Anh - H\u00e0 n\u1ed9i. K. is the leader of a 4-member loan group sponsored by SEDA. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is X\u00f3m M\u00edt (4).\r\n\r\nK. is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, K. works in a manufacturing business that is owned by someone else. The business makes and sells manufactured products to local businesses and community members.  K. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, K. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  K. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1.972.000 VND from SEDA. She used her previous loan to purchase machinery to expand the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 5.014.000 VND to purchase machinery to expand the business. This will be the K.'s 4th loan from SEDA.  K. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nK.

He is 57 years old. Vicente is married and has 6 children. To make a living, Vicente owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Vicente also tills a parcel of land where he plants and harvests rice crops.

Ulfat couldn\u2019t educate her children due to financial constraints. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to improve her husband\u2019s grocery store business. With the loan, he will purchase groceries in bulk quantities that will allow him to fill his customer orders and earn better profits. Her husband has been operating this business for the past 10 years and Ulfat is confident that he will successfully be able to improve it after investing the loan in it. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo,

","en":"Enith is 65 years old and lives in Polo Nuevo, located in the northeast zone of the Department of the Atlantic, in the geological basin of the Magdalena River. She lives there with her husband and has 2 children. She is in the retail traD.. She sells a variety of merchandise on a retail basis from a sales point located on a highly traveled road, which is good for her sales volume. Enith started her business in 2006 when she became unemployed, and thanks to the initiative of her daughter who already had this kind of business, she began to sell products ordered from specialty catalogs. She bought a display case and stocked it with products provided by her daughter. Gradually she built up some capital, which she used to add shoes, women's clothing and other products in demand among her domestic customers. Currently, she sells retail on a cash basis and also on credit based on orders from her customers, with whom she works out the form of payment. Her goal for the future is to expand her business until it becomes a well-known store in Polo Nuevo, stocked with everything that the local inhabitants need and are able to buy. With her Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, she will buy paper goods and clothing products, for which there is very little competition in the village, and which will make her investment successful.

Her business is located in her home because she has several hectares of land which she makes the most out of for her business.  She has been dedicated to fish farming for three years now, thanks to the idea that came to her after seeing her in-laws work in this business.  Since she saw that she had adequate land for this business, she decided to try it, and that is how she currently has two pools that yield between 500 and 1000 kilograms of fish every three months, depending on the season.  The fish farming business is generating good income for Margarita, which allows her to support her family and a daughter that is in college.<p>\r\nWith the recent credit that she received from Manuela Ramos of 1,800 nuevos soles ($600.00) to be paid in a term of 4 months, Margarita will buy the necessary raw supplies for fish production, 2 motors to pump water to the pools and to wash the pools every so often, a 150 meter fishing net, and food to provide a balanced diet for the fish.  She will also increase the amount of fish and number of breeds.<p>\r\nMargarita is 39 years old, is married, and has four children that still depend on her and her husband.  Her oldest daughter is at college, and her other children are still in high school.

She and her husband own a motorcycle taxi, which her husband drives, as well as a carpentry shop, where he works when he is not driving the taxi. They opened the workshop a year and a half ago, prior to which her husband worked for a public agency in Ayacucho. He usually works by himself, but when he receives large orders he hires workers. \r\n\r\nNancy is requesting a loan of 2000 soles to buy wood for the workshop. She and her husband work mainly with tornillo (an inexpensive wood found in South America) and sometimes with oak, depending on the order.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

She is 43 and is the mother of 2 children, who are 15 and 13.  Her kids are students and still depend on her economically.  Because of the need to provide economic income for her home and because she didn't have a job, she decided to start a small business selling groceries with her first credit of 300 PEN.  She saw very good results from the start because of the quality of her products, her reasonable prices, and her good customer service.  Currently she continues with the same business, which is located in her home and where her main customers are the people from her neighborhood.  With this loan of 2,200 PEN, she will buy more products to supply her business like rice and sugar by the kilogram, eggs in cartons, personal and cleaning products, soft drinks, candy, and other items to keep her customers happy.  Today she is very happy with the work and service that she offers, and she is thankful to Manuela Ramos for supporting people like her who want to work and to get ahead.

children.  To make a living, Faifua prepares and sells a variety of food products in the local community.  Faifua has been engaged in this business for over a year, earning approximately 800 WST a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faifua joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having fully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD that was used to purchase raw ingredients needed for the business, she is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be her 3rd loan from SPBD, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Daanglungsod, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a pig fattening business. Her husband Hipolito N., who is 49 years old, works as a tricycle (three-wheeled transport) driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 3 to 16 years old.  \r\n\r\nGemma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gemma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future, support the family and do house repairs.  Gemma N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They have 7 children of which only 3 live with them, the youngest daughter being under  3 years old. The whole family lives in a cottage of their own. \r\n\r\nFelix's parents taught him farm work, an activity that also supports his large family. He has agricultural land that the Punray community grants.  In the parcels he plants different varieties of potatoes, peas, beans and vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, cabbage, among others.  He considers it more profitable to plant peas and potatoes, which have demand in the city and he brings them to the city of Lima for mass consumption. \r\n\r\nThe main problem he points out are the low and high prices. \"There are months when the price falls and I only recover capital, but yet we go on,\" he adds. Later, Felix wanted to buy a car to establish a transport service in their community to the city of Tarma.  Over time his efforts will not be the same for plowing. Felix also longs to see his little children grow up, and for that he will continue to work even more than now. \r\n\r\nThis loan would be his 8th loan with MFP.

The other one is still studying in junior high school. Jero Melati has run the kiosk business for almost 15 years. Now Jero Melati really needs additional capital for the kiosk. Jero Melati gets a loan of Rp 2,500,000 from Dinari. The loan will be used to add more varieties of merchandise such as variety of soft drink, snacks and also staple merchandises. Every morning after selling local chickens in Melaya market, Jero Melati buys merchandices in the market to be re-sold. Her daily profit is Rp 25,000 to Rp 30,000.

Jero melati menekuni usaha warung sudah hampir 15 tahun. Dan saat ini Jero Melati benar- benar membutuhkan modal untuk usaha warungnya. Jero Melati mendapatkan pinjaman dari Dinari sebesar Rp. 2.500.000,- Modal ini digunakan untuk menambah dagangan lebih banyak lagi seperti membeli beraneka macam minuman dan makanan ringan serta kebutuhan sehari \u2013hari. Setiap pagi setelah selesai berjualan ayam kampung di pasar Melaya Jero Melati baru membeli dagangan dipasar untuk dijual kembali. Keuntungan yang diperoleh setiap hari Rp. 25.000,- s\/d Rp.30.000,-. Dan Jero Melati berharap dengan bertambahnya modal yang dipergunakan dalam usaha ini keuntungannya pun bisa meningkat dan tetap berharap usaha ini nantinya akan

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nDivina is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Divina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising chickens to produce eggs for sale. Divina has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Divina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Divina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Divina is requesting a new loan of 18,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Divina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is requesting a loan, to be repaid in 4 months, to be able to purchase the items her customers are requesting and offer them new products as well.  With your help, Juana will be able to build her business and provide for a better future for her children. <\/p>\r\n\r\nJuana es una madre de familia que no cuenta con el apoyo del padre de sus hijos para poder obtener dinero para pagar los gastos de sus hijos. Es por eso que con la ayuda de unas amigas le recomendaron que vendiera ropa de vencer\u00eda, zapatos y otros art\u00edculos por cat\u00e1logo para poder obtener ingresos, pero sin descuidar a sus hijos, que necesitan tanto de ella para poder sobrellevar la ausencia de un padre de familia. <p>\r\n\r\nSin embargo actualmente tuvo muchos gastos, por lo tanto la administraci\u00f3n de su negocio sufri\u00f3 un d\u00e9ficit. Es por eso que Juana est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $300 que est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 4 meses, y con este dinero Juana podr\u00e1 comprar mercanc\u00eda que le est\u00e1n solicitando y as\u00ed poder tener productos nuevos que ofrecerle a sus clientes. Con tu ayuda Juana podr\u00e1 sacar adelante su negocio adem\u00e1s de poder ayudarle a sus hijos a salir adelante y en un futuro poder estudiar una carrera universitaria.\r\n\r\n<p>Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":108347,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"TO PURCHASE MERCHANDISE TO GROW HER CATALOG BUSINESS, BETTER MEET THE DEMANDS OF HER CUSTOMERS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR HER CHILDREN.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Montemorelos, Nuevo Le\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-12-31T13:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-14T15:02:28Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2008-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":816.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125162},{"amount":75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":816.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144591},{"amount":75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":816.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169841},{"amount":75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":816.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196078}],"funded_date":"2007-12-31T15:02:28Z","paid_date":"2008-04-30T09:03:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":34204,"name":"Korn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Korn M., age 30, works with her husband as a \"middle man\", purchasing rubber from the grower and reselling it for a profit, making collectively around $7\/day of income.

She has not had sufficient income, and has worked hard to achieve her goals so she can give her children what they need.

Desde su ni\u00f1ez ha estado muy ligado a las tareas agr\u00edcolas y ganaderas y desde hace m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os se dedica a la crianza y venta de animales de ganado vacuno, actividad que realiza en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposa, quien es la que siempre vela por la buena salud de sus animales, pues de ello depende la cotizaci\u00f3n para una venta. Para mantener saludable a su ganado los lleva desde muy temprano a lugares donde abundan pastos frescos y un sol radiante, estas zonas son muy distantes de su casa, como a una hora caminando. Despu\u00e9s de varios meses de crianza selecciona a aquellos animales que ha de vender en la feria ganadera, con cuya ganancia puede sostener, durante un tiempo prudencial, los gastos familiares. La ganader\u00eda es muy rentable para Jorge porque tiene menos riesgos de p\u00e9rdida que en la agricultura y pagan un buen precio por cada animal que vende, por esta raz\u00f3n quiere aumentar la cantidad de animales que tiene. Esta es la tercera vez que tiene un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y nota que trabajar con su banco comunal es un buen respaldo cuando lo necesita.

Since his childhood he has been very connected to agicultural work and especially to live-stock farming.  For the past five years he has made a living by raising and selling beef cattle.  He works with his wife who always looks out for the health of the animals.  The health of the animals is important when it comes to pricing and selling the animals.  To keep the cattle healthly Jorge takes them out early in the morning to graze where there are abundant and fresh fields and where it is sunny.  These areas are very far from his house and take about an hour to walk to.  After raising the cattle for various months Jorge selects the animals that he will sell at the livestock market.  The money that he makes from selling the animals allow him to provide for his family.  Livestock farming is very profitable for Jorge and has less risks than growing crops.  He is paid a nice sum for each animal.  Because of this Jorge needs to increase the number of animals that he has.  This is the third time that he is requesting a loan through MFP.  He says that working with his communal bank is a great support for him.  With the money that he is requesting he will buy various calves to raise and to sell when they are grown.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by San Roque School, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":347895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase calves to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-06T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733992}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T20:45:38Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kendra Gaete","image":null}},{"id":124339,"name":"Vicenta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicenta C. is from the village of Barandiaz, Pangantucan, Bukidnon.

She owns a business venture, selling fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Faapepele has 2 years of experience in this business.  Faapepele needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faapepele joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faapepele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faapepele L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers. Despite these difficulties, Ana runs a successful business selling clothing to her community. With this loan, she will buy clothing to sell at a small markup.\r\n\r\nThis is Ana\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza International. With her access to capital, she hopes to continue the growth of her business. Her profits have so far led to partial construction of her home and other improvements. Ana looks forward to continuing the growth of income so she can finish her house, save, and invest in other areas to make a better life for herself and her husband.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

However, being a mother who sees the poor situation of her children and grandchildren, she is motivated to be as productive as she can to augment the lives of her loved ones. Clemente is a farmer who plants rice and vegetables on a small parcel of land they own. Norma is a support that strengthens her husband\u2019s livelihood, being the one who sells their products, and a help with their financial needs. Norma also has her own business venture with the support of her husband. Through the loans she received since she joined ASHI in 2007, she has been able to purchase coconut fruit from the landowners of a coconut land. She pays in advance and they are the ones to harvest the fruit when it is mature. With it, Norma and her husband have able to make \u201ccopra\u201d which they sell in large volume to a middleman who transports and does wholesaling to a manufacturer of coconut oil in the neighboring province. As the amount of loans she requests and receives through ASHI increases, the coconut land she has able to invest on also expands, thus making the volume of her sales grow bigger and bigger.\r\n\r\nNorma really enjoyed the business she does and her family enjoys the profit it makes. Because of this, the woman really wishes that her business would become sustainable and profitable in the future so she can employ her family members and improve their lives. With this vision, she and her husband agreed to request a much larger loan through ASHI. Since both are working so hard to grow their business and maintain a very good performance in ASHI in terms of payments and attendance at weekly center meetings, they believe that they are qualified to be trusted with the amount they are requesting.

fishing and being a caretaker of a fishpond businesse.  She lives in Purok Banagan, Brgy. Tomongtong, EB Magalona, Negros Occidental.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.  By working hard in her fishing and fish vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000.  \r\n\r\nHaydee is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she could purchase a new engine for her pump boat.  This will be her 8th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Haydee aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Abdukarim is 44 years old, married and has four children. He makes a living by selling cattle and providing transportation services. As a rule, he buys young cattle in the central market, feeds them and than resells them for a higher price in a local market. Because he has been in this business for five years, he knows a lot about which animals to choose, the best ways to breed them and how to care for them. His work requires him to get up early every morning in order to feed his animals and look after them, but it also allows him to generate an ample and stable income for his large family. Abdukarim knows that the price of cattle is low now but believes it will increase in the future, which is why he has applied for this loan, for $3,000, to enlarge his herd.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRodel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. Aside from the store, he has a small videoke machine at home. A videoke is a combined term for video karaoke. \r\n\r\nRodel earns his income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece in his store; having his videoke machines for rent; and putting up a small area of his house as a small videoke area where people can hang out and sing. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community. He earns a minimum of 268 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a 27,000 PHP loan. He will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand his product inventory, and for maintenance of his videoke machines. He expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business. \r\n\r\nRodel hopes to be able to expand soon, just as he hopes to support his children's schooling up to college level.

are school students.  Having started her agricultural business over ten years ago with practically nothing, Rahimakhon achieved good results.  Today, she has eight heads of sheep and cultivated land with potatoes, corn and sunflowers in her household.  Her monthly income from the sale of these products amounts to an average of 6,000 som (KGS), which provides a good support for the family, where the husband receives only a disability pension.  Rahimakhon went to the \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" to obtain a loan in the sum of 80,000 som for the purchase of livestock.  She plans to invest the resulting income into business expansion and repairs for the animal shed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":855785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kosh-Terek village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-08-23T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahimakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":24000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":56000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":540},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1260}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":540,"local_amount":24000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":24263.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338970},{"amount":165.29,"local_amount":7346,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":7426.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862739},{"amount":1094.71,"local_amount":48654,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":49188.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399743496}],"funded_date":"2011-08-24T22:19:09Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T09:30:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":334179,"name":"Gaby","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Gaby trabaja como comerciante de productos alimenticios, tambi\u00e9n trabaja como empleada en una confiter\u00eda - salon de t\u00e9 de la ciudad de La Paz.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. The variety store is the place to go to buy one small container of shampoo, five PHP-worth of cooking oil, or a single egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling items individually. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRita hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams that, through all her hard work on her business, she will be able to give her children a high-quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week, where she can share stories of her work and also draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":946510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy stock for her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738886},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2355.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146112},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2354.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275284},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1766.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997829}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:43:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maggie Evans","image":859808}},{"id":375179,"name":"Maria Raquel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Raquel  vive en Ica ,ciudad caracterizada actualmente por el incremento de inversi\u00f3n, no solo en la agroexporaciones, es decir en los fundos, si no tambi\u00e9n, en la apertura de nuevos centros comerciales que brindan muchos puestos de trabajo a pobladores ique\u00f1os;  como bien se sabe el Per\u00fa se caracteriza por tener las comidas m\u00e1s deliciosas del mundo y uno de los platillos que m\u00e1s le agrada es \u201cCarapulcra con Sopa Seca\u201d  Maria Raquel estudi\u00f3 hasta quinto grado de primaria y l hubiera gustado estudiar para ser profesora, tienen 4 hijos todos ellos han terminado de estudiar en nivel superior.\t\n\n\"Maria Raquel se dedica al Venta de Comida junto a la ayuda de su pareja; ofrece diversos platillos de la exquisita comida peruana, aproximadamente  se dedica a u negocio 3 horas diarias, y se animo gracias a la iniciativa de una de sus amigas.

They visit herders in the countryside with their truck and purchase livestock at a discount when they can. Once they bring the livestock home, they slaughter them and prepare them for sale. Once the meat is ready for the market, they sell it to wholesale middlemen from their town and Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. In the future, they would like to create their own channel to bring livestock to the town without visiting each herder in the countryside. They request a loan to purchase livestock from herders.\r\n

She is a single mother with two grown-up children who help her out financially. Her daughter, who lives in the United States, helps her out with $200.00. She also gets financial support from her son. However, Elsa has always been a very hardworking woman who struggled to help her family get ahead on her own for many years, and she is not thinking about stopping now. For this reason, she started selling perfume, body lotions, and other cosmetics 5 years ago, and she has had success in sales.

M. is 26 and married with 2 children (ages 1 and 3).  She owns a business venture, selling food products in the local community.  Vitolio has many years of experience in this business.  Vitolio needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vitolio joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Vitolio's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Vitolio M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Juliet was like any other na\u00efve business upstart. Being in two minds did not help either, as she was on the one hand being dissuaded from trying her hand at any other business, whilst her close consorts were constantly prevailing upon her to start a retail shop.\r\n\r\nWith huge reserves of courage and conviction in tow, Juliet, in the midst of all this, made up her mind to start a retail shop in Buwenge, Jinja. She decided to dispense with the soft drink business she had all along banked on as her main source of livelihood.\r\n\r\nJuliet\u2019s hard work ethic spawned an unprecedented growth in her business profits.

She is 49 years old, married, and has six adult children. To make a living, Julita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Julita has been engaged in her business for over 16 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Julita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to expand the business. Julita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Julita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":621223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
