It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

SDA Primary School, Makeni was founded in 1978 by the SDA Mission to use education as a vehicle for spreading the Adventist message. They train young boys in the morals and ethics of the Adventist Mission.\r\n\r\nSDA Primary School suffered a lot of setbacks over the past years. However, with the intervention of Mr. Benjamin K. as the new headmaster at the school, the school has experienced vast improvements. The new administration under the leadership of Benjamin K. has been able to buy benches for classes five and six through school fees subsidies and development funds. The school has also been able to hire two security guards to keep thieves at bay. And for the first time in the history of the school, it has been able to organize athletics for the pupils. This has added popularity and fame to the school.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan SDA Primary School will be accessing from SMT\/Kiva. (See their journal update through the following link: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=96443.)\r\n\r\nTeachers from this institution, like many other teachers within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nBenjamin M. K. is the head teacher at the school. Thirty-eight-year-old Benjamin (left) is married to a student and they have one child who is still not of school-going age. Benjamin was born in Makeni city. With his share of the loan, he will buy house-building materials \u2013 cement, rods, iron, corrugated tin, etc. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":472373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy house-building materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-01-19T01:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benjamin M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umu J.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul Karim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edna F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abdul K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catherine M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Issa S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marah M.

She has employed her two daughters who work roughly 12 hours a week and earn 25,000 colons each (per week). One of her daughters specializes in cosmetics and the other works with hair.

She is well aware of the highly competitive market that exists for beauty services and products in her community. \r\n\r\nIleana\u00b4s revenues have been affected by competitors under-cutting each other\u2019s prices for services in an effort to attract new clients and to keep old ones. Ileana is confident that she will maintain the loyalty of her clients because she uses high quality products and is not willing to compromise that quality in exchange for profits.

Monica is an exemplary mother and homemaker who opened her doors to us to confide in us about her life and activities. She owns crop lands in the local foothills on which she cultivates coffee and ginger. She sells her crops at the wholesale market in the city of Pichanaki. \"I try to balance my production so that my income can cover my necessities all year long, and we have prospered with both crops,\" Monica states. At the same time, Monica opened a small general store, which she has neglected because she needed to dedicate herself fully to agriculture. However, she hopes be able to restart that business in the future as a lack of capital was the obstacle that prevented its launching. Monica yearns to increase her coffee crop, but to do so, she must rent land and invest in fertilizer, plants, and labor. Once this plan becomes concrete, she will be able to offer her family a better quality of life. Thanks to your help, this will be the first time that she obtains a loan from MFP, which is why she commits to being punctual in making her repayments. Regarding her communal bank, she demonstrates a predisposition to become a member as soon as it is organized. Once she obtains the money, Monica will invest it in purchasing basic need items and other goods to sell in her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":919245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase basic need items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1014,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400764}],"funded_date":"2011-11-24T05:29:28Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":362532,"name":"Radnaabazar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Radnaabazar is 61 years old and lives with her husband in a ger (a Mongolian yurt) in Arhangai Province, Mongolia.

Four years ago, she lost her husband and was left in charge of the education and expenses of her children. With few resources, the first thing that she thought to do was to sell food.  So, with a small investment she started to sell food between her neighborhoods.\r\n<p>With the passage of the time, she was able to obtain a little food store restaurant in front of her house. Now she wants to purchase live animals, like turkeys and pigs, to prepare and sell for Christmas and New Year's dinners. This investment will allow her to maintain her income level through the rest of the year as this season the food she commonly sells must be offered cheaper. She comments that her experience of previous years has helped her to learn to take advantage of the opportunity of this season and, for that reason, she needs a credit  of US$ 550 hopping to repay this loan in 6 months (at least).<p>**This text has been translated from the original business description.**<p> Delta Alicia es una mujer joven de 35 a\u00f1os que en el 2002, sufri\u00f3 la perdida de su esposo, quedando a cargo de la manutenci\u00f3n y  educaci\u00f3n de sus 3 hijos menores. Con pocos recursos, lo primero que se le ocurri\u00f3 fue el vender comida, y as\u00ed con una m\u00ednima inversi\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 a vender alimentos preparados entre sus vecinos, con buena aceptaci\u00f3n. Poco a poco fue avanzando en la actividad hasta tener una peque\u00f1a loncher\u00eda en la entrada de su casa. Por estas fechas Delta esta interesada en comprar animales en pie: Pavos y Cerdos, los cuales piensa vender ya preparados para la cena de navidad y de a\u00f1o nuevo. Esta inversi\u00f3n le permitir\u00e1 solventar sus principales gastos econ\u00f3micos pues en estas fechas las ventas normales bajan. Comenta que la experiencia de a\u00f1os anteriores le ha ense\u00f1ado a sacar ventaja de la oportunidad que se le presenta, es por lo anterior que esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo por la cantidad de US$ 550 a 6 meses, para estar preparada y poder aprovechar la temporada con alimentos diferentes a lo que habitualmente ella vende. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":1381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Alive animals purchase","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Yucat\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2006-11-03T07:19:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delta Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-18T11:17:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2006-12-13T18:11:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3016},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-02-03T17:58:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6344},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-02-03T17:59:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6357},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-03-17T10:30:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226},{"amount":182,"local_amount":182,"processed_date":"2007-05-04T09:25:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-05T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":182,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15088}],"funded_date":"2006-11-04T11:17:06Z","paid_date":"2007-05-04T09:25:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5191,"name":"Nasiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This young woman was born in 1979 in Salyan region Yenikand village.

For the last 12-years, she and her husband have dedicated themselves to the art of shoe making.  At a very young age, her husband worked for a shoemaker and gained a lot of knowledge which he eventually used to start his own business.  And from there, Magdalena learned to make shoes of all designs, using basic materials in leather for all shapes and sizes.  Their shop, with the passage of time has been growing, and today they make about 100 pairs of shoes.  With these years of working, Magdalena and her husband have managed to purchase the plot of land where their house is, put three kids through school with two of them now as professionals who are able to fend for themselves.\r\n<p>  \r\nFor Magdalena, she feels that she gets the most satisfaction performing her job for her family. Every weekend they go to the city of Ayacucho and Huanta to sell their shoes. Sometimes, for Magdalena it is very difficult when customers don\u2019t repay their debt on time. Magdalena strives each day to succeed and to help her youngest daughter get a college education.  She requests a loan to buy more leather and tools to make shoes and to increase their production.  Magdalena\u2019s great desire is to be an exporter of their products, for which they are preparing their youngest daughter to take up the challenge.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jenson Abraham, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":216455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy leather and more tools for shoe making.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T01:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T21:56:19Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":583.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":583.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:17:35Z","rounded_local_amount":586.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957470},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":583.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":586.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227720},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":583.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":586.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422955},{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":583.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":586.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116179},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":583.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":586.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011139},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":583.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":586.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594742}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T20:56:19Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenson Abraham","image":206726}},{"id":74847,"name":"Virgen De Lourdes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"EL GRUPO VIRGEN D.

Therefore, the family's financial situation is steady.\r\n\r\nFor this loan cycle, she would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest further into her clothing store business.<br

Fati belongs to a village bank called \u201cKronkronye Name\u201d which literally means \u201cGod\u2019s Holiness\u201d.<p>Times have been very tough for Fati but she decided not to give up. Fati learned a trade to earn a living. She now runs a food vending stand and sells cocoa drink with pastries. She prepares those pastries with flour, sugar, margarine, eggs etc. She normally sells in the morning between 6:00 am and 11:00 am.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is married to HOUNWEDO Richard, a furniture maker.  Marcelline has not yet had children.  It\u2019s been three years since she opened her hair salon in her conjugal home in ZOGBO, a district of Cotonou.  But in the past, while she was on leave finishing her apprenticeship, she sold for a few months cornmeal mash, locally called \u201cakassa\u201d, with fried fish.

In addition to hairdressing, she also sells hair products and goods (hair extensions, straighteners, shampoos, etc.)  To server her customers better, she is requesting her first loan from ALID\u00e9 to equip her hair salon even further.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":367519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy 50 dozen hair extensions and 9 boxes of cosmetic products ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-08-10T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Marcelline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549957},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983748},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896117},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735697},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623208},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019913},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858407},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618561},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144652640},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20779.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151834733}],"funded_date":"2009-08-11T04:00:55Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":132219,"name":"Elma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elma M. is from the village of Naawan, Iligan City.

The income of her husband is not enough to support her 4 dependent children especially with their school needs. To help her husband, she decided to engage in the business of selling bananas, firewood and other products. With an initial capital of P1,000.00 for bananas and P200.00 for firewood, she has been able to sustain her business for 10 years. Presently she is earning an average net income of P3,500.00 a month which is a great help with supporting her family. With excellent character and loyalty in our co-op, she has been able to avail her 2nd cycle loan under the PDP-LP Program in the amount of P10,000.00. This will add to her capital for bananas and firewood. Her future plans are to repair her house and be able to continually support her children, especially for their college

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from the buying and selling of bananas in the local community. Dessa has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Dessa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Dessa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Dessa from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Su idea emprendedora data de hace cuatro a\u00f1os, cuando observando el gran despliegue comercial del d\u00eda de las madres en el mes de Mayo, la cantidad de tiempo que la gente gasta en la compra de detalles para obsequiar a las mujeres y el dinero que significa este ejercicio a las familias, decidi\u00f3 iniciar un negocio. aprovechando las oportunidades ofrecidas por cada  temporada comercial; Yenis comenz\u00f3 con un capital proveniente de prestamistas informales a un alto costo, que hoy ha podido pagar, pero dejando de generar mejores utilidades netas y oportunidades de inversi\u00f3n en su negocio. \nDespu\u00e9s de un trabajo disciplinado y persistente, Yenis cuenta con un capital de trabajo muy peque\u00f1o, que quiere ampliar mediante el financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y por eso est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, para invertirlo en \u00fatiles escolares porque es la mercanc\u00eda que m\u00e1s se mueve en esta temporada y le representa una buena rotaci\u00f3n de productos y una pronta utilidad.

There she sells a variety of products, including cosmetics, stationery products, clothes, footwear and accessories.  Her business is called \"Productos Yennys\". \r\n\r\nYenis had the idea of setting up her business four years ago when she observed the great commercial display that took place around Mothers' Day, in the month of May.  She saw the amount of time and the money that people spent buying little gifts to give to women.  As a result, she decided to start her own business, taking advantage of the opportunities offered by each commercial season.\r\n\r\nYenis started out with some capital that she acquired from informal lenders at a high cost.  She managed to pay this money back but she lost out on making better net profits and missed opportunities to invest in her business.  Through disciplined and persistent work, however, Yenis now has a very small amount of working capital that she would like to increase through this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She is applying for a Kiva loan so that she can invest in buying school supplies because they are the merchandise that sells at this time of year and they will represent a good product turnover and a quick profit.\r\n\r\nYenis is very satisfied with her business because it has enabled her to make income to cover the basic needs of her family.  Her family consists of herself and her three children who are currently aged between 17 and 23.  Yenis' dream and greatest challenge is to increase her income so that she can respond to the expenses that come from improving her children's living conditions, adapting her home and providing her children with a good-quality education.  She also hopes to grow her business which has been affected by the fact that, up until now, she has worked solely with the personal capital that she has managed to make from her own efforts.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":736813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

and desire to progress and succeed in the future. The majority of members make bags and napkins, and they chose their group name as it characterizes their area and culture. \r\n\r\nOne of the group's members is 27-year-old Leticia who is happily married to Paul, 28. They have three children - one daughter (age 11) and two sons. Leticia works hard to give her children a better life, so that they can study away from home as there is no college where they could obtain a degree in their town. \r\n\r\nLeticia sells handicrafts such as woven bags, napkins and traditional tunics. She has had this business for about ten years, and what she likes best about it is embroidery, which she has enjoyed since childhood. Leticia's mother taught her how to embroider, and how to combine cheerful colors to make her napkins look attractive.\r\n\r\nOne of Leticia's dreams is to have a dressmaking school where she can teach people to embroider clothes, which is another of her passions that enriches her life.\r\n \r\nLeticia has asked for this loan to buy more material for producing bags and napkins, such as colored threads, bleached and colored cotton, needles and rings to tighten the fabric, and embroidery hooks.\r\n\r\nShe thanks the foundation for the support they have offered to help change her life, provide a better future and enable her family to live better. Thanks to the foundation, families in needy communities have received help.\r\n\r\nThe other members that make up the group are:\r\n\r\nValentina, who makes traditional tunics, bathrobes, napkins and tablecloths.\r\nJose M., who makes cheese and sells milk.\r\nAntonacia, who makes traditional tunics, towels and bathrobes\r\nBeatrice, who makes napkins, bathrobes and tunics.\r\nBufemia, who makes traditional tunics, towels and bathrobes\r\nVirginia, Mary, Maria Lourdes and Mary Agnes, who make napkins and tablecloths.\r\n \r\n\r\nThey thank the foundation for the support, and for caring about those who want to make better lives for themselves.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":915411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase thread, cotton, rings, needles etc., for producing woven bags and napkins","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T03:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bufemia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":215.63,"local_amount":2875,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2915.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573395},{"amount":646.88,"local_amount":8625,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":8745.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785107},{"amount":215.62,"local_amount":2875,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2915.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193670},{"amount":646.87,"local_amount":8625,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8745.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330031}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T07:13:25Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Fiona Craig","image":null}},{"id":362548,"name":"Charito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"40-year-old Charito earns a living selling dried fish and also dealing in Avon and Natasha products in her community.

Description<\/h4> \r\n <p>Adelaida has 15 years of experience in the business of selling fish. She started out with her own savings, selling in one corner of her home. At present, Adelaida sells fried fish with rice and vegetable stew on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Adelaida works by herself. She is a single mother, but she considers herself a fighter. Adelaida has seen development in her business, since thanks to her fish sales she has directed part of her capital toward buying yogurt in 2 or 4 liter containers which she delivers every 15 days and at the end of the month to the crew of a shrimp boat on the peninsula.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>Adelaida is requesting this loan in order to increase her business. The demand has grown for her yogurt and fish sales. She also indicates to us that she has thought of investing in the purchase of milk, coconut, and sugar to make homemade ice cream.

Todos estos esfuerzos son realizados por que quieren otorgarle educaci\u00f3n a cada uno de sus ocho hijos y esta fuerza que los impulsa tambi\u00e9n los motiva a desear abrir un peque\u00f1o negocio m\u00e1s adelante; mientras tanto seguir\u00e1 trabajando en sus campos de cultivo y para ello solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que los invertir\u00e1 en la compra de fertilizantes.Apoyemos a Le\u00f3n en su continua lucha de generar bienestar a su familia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":90375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-01T20:45:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Le\u00f3n Hoover","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-15T23:53:14Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116661},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136501},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159241},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184010},{"amount":59,"local_amount":168.57,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":177.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211570},{"amount":55,"local_amount":157.14,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":165.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239721}],"funded_date":"2007-12-01T23:53:14Z","paid_date":"2008-06-16T09:09:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29784,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Dora, who grew up in a home whose principal work was and is agriculture, learned how to do this work when she was very young from working with her parents.

She worked as a domestic servant there for five years, and then left Maputo for Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland, when she met her husband, who worked for Petromoc in Namaacha. He gave her funds for her to start raising chickens. She's been raising them for more than 10 years. She has between 200 and 300 chickens. She spends 20,000 mt, and earns 7000 mt a month. She manages to save 2000 mt and rents a hencoop for 1000 mt, so that in the future her two children will be able to take care of her nephew, whose parents are dead.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Ana will receive from Hluvuku and Kiva.

She rents a small stall in the Hantalst shopping mall, one of the large indoor shopping centers in Ulaanbaatar. She sells women's and men's shoes that she brings from Ereen, China, a  border town, where many inexpensive Chinese products are imported to Mongolia. Because Ulambayar chooses the\r\ncheapest shoes, her shoes are sold fast and easily. Besides shoes, she also sells dried fruit at the market, which shoppers purchase as snacks. \r\n\r\nUlambayar says that she would like to continue building a small house that she has already started on the plot of land that her family owns. She would like to expedite the building process with profits from her business. She requests a loan to purchase more shoes for her business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank:\r\n\r\nFounded in 1998, XacBank is a community development bank and microfinance institution in Mongolia, and is headquartered in Ulaanbaatar.

Dina is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cPatr\u00f3n San Roque\u201d, which is located in the District of Sacanche, Bellavista Province, Department of San Mart\u00edn. She is 48 years old, married, and the mother of two children of whom one is still a dependent.  \r\n<p>\r\nFive years ago, Dina was motivated to start a small business selling groceries.  She received her first loan of 300 soles to start her business.  Dina achieved good results from the beginning as a result of the quality of her products, low prices, and providing good service to her customers.  She continues to manage her business from home to this very day.

He lives in his own home with his wife Gregoria (50) and their 3 children, to whom he wants to offer a better future. When he was very young, Guillermo learned to farm with his parents, who taught him everything he needs to know to produce a good crop. He now owns his own land, which he cares for and farms with great patience. He sows peas and potatoes, which he later brings to his city's wholesale market to sell. What he loves most about his work is harvest time, which is when sees the fruit of his arduous labour. He has been farming for 25 years and his greatest challenge is protecting his crops from pests. His greatest wish is to buy a car, with which he would be able to transport his produce for sale in the market.

For four years she has been selling household products on foot, assisted by her husband, offering her merchandise in far off places in her rural area. The benefit that Nelly grants is that she gives credit and, 15 days later, she returns to collect and sell again. What she offers to her customers depends on the occasion: in this cold season, her customers request blankets. In school season, they request school uniforms and other various articles. For Nelly, this work is profitable because she earns a reasonable profit with each product that she sells so it justifies the effort she and her husband put forth. For the future, Nelly wishes to grow her market, traveling to other places to offer her merchandise. This is the second time that she has taken a loan with MFP. She is very happy to continue a joint effort with her community bank. Her wish is that she continues this work despite difficult circumstances that might crop up. The money that she is requesting is to stock up on more household products which are her working capital.

She lives with her 2 children, who study courses at university, and her house is her own. As a specialist in the art of handicrafts, she makes plush dolls, bordered in material, adorned with diverse material, among others. She has done this activity for 9 years and has a small workshop in her house, where she also trains a group of single mothers in different styles of handicrafts, so that they can be covered economically. Ida really likes her job because she meets every type of person, and it is also profitable enough to cover the expenses of her home. For the future, Ida wants to have a cleaning product business, additional to her handicraft business. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she likes to work with her communal bank because they are all working women with the desire to overcome their problems.

She has 2 years of experience in this business. Sinavailemalama needs a loan of 1,500 WST to purchase weed-killers, such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinavailemalama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Sinavailemalama's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\nSPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and thE. are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\".  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.

Ikromidin is 37 years old. He lives with his wife and has two children. Like his parents, who cultivated large crops, he has been a farmer since he was a boy. He enjoys being a farmer. Like his brother, he plants crops and then eventually he or his wife takes the products directly to market to sell. This way, he does not have to give away any of his efforts to middlemen.\r\n<p>\r\nFarming brings Ikromidin good earnings. He tells us that to succeed, you only need to know how to take care of what you plant and to pay attention to what the crops need. Therefore, he fertilizes his crops so that he has a good harvest. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with IMON International and he is responsible with his payments. The money he is requesting will be invested in high-quality seeds and fertilizer. Ikromidin is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his goals with this loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Los Alcarrizos is a community on the outskirts of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.

He is 61 years old and operates a business selling basic staples: beans, rice, sugar, maize, chicken.  His wife helps him with sales.  He started the business with savings and a redundancy payment that he received from a former employer.  He started with a small grocery, but then switched to selling larger volumes of basic staples.  Chicken, for example, and it's for chicken sales that he needs a loan because he wants to buy another freezer to store enough chickens to meet demand.  He also wants to buy a display case for his products.  He hopes to increase his sales and invest in more supplies of basic staples.  The advantage of these loans is that he has been able to use them to rebalance the business as well as increase his sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

The water is not potable.\n\nAntonio makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and  4 children.

He plans to continue doing business and enjoying the time he spends with his children.\n\nAntonio is excited to be taking out his third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and growing his business. He has had his business for 8 years, starting with a candy stand. He plans to use this loan to purchase 3 bags of rice, 2 bags of sugar, 3 big cans of oil and beans for his business.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 WST or US $208 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinuu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sinuu's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Neema thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She is 24 years old. She attended school until 10th grade, and she's the single mother of a 6-year-old boy. In addition to her son, she also supports her nephew and a sister.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 she left Maputo to live in Matola with her family, and she's still there. Ol\u00edmpia is a full-time shopkeeper, owner of her own business. She's worked for four years by herself, without any employees.\r\n\r\nShe learned business from a friend in Maputo and has 8 years of experience. She sells bedsheets and other cloth goods (duvets, handkerchiefs, curtains, etc.). She buys some of her products in South Africa at 1500 meticals and sells them at 3000 meticals. She earns 12,000 meticals a month, which she uses to support her family. She is also able to save a little each month.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 11,000 meticals. She will use it to stock her store. She's never had loans from other institutions. She heard about Hluvuku-Adsema through a friend who had received a loan from the organization.
