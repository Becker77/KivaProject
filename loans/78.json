Bertha has not been discouraged by the fact that she did not finish her studies.  Rather, this motivated her to gather her strength and will as a fighting woman, in order to face any obstacles that she encounters.  As a result of her constant efforts, she has been able to develop a business that has good economic results.  She grows and sells cocoa, and her customers feel satisfied with the quality of her product.  She wants to continue working in agriculture, as she feels happy with the work she is doing.  She receives help from her children during the planting and harvesting seasons, and she always works with her beloved husband.  They both work from 7:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening, and they make their sales for a fair price at the local gathering center.\r\n\r\nHer future plan is to diversify her products by growing coffee and citrus fruits, and in this way, to increase her income.  This is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she assures that she will comply faithfully with her repayment obligations.  She also feels strengthened by her communal bank because they all work as a team.  With the loan she is requesting, she plans to invest in the purchase of supplies and fertilizers, with the goal of adequately caring for her cocoa fields.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie Kavanagh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":581888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2030.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463072}],"funded_date":"2010-08-14T18:52:10Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":225682,"name":"Ork","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ork A. is a 50-year-old resident of Kompong Tom Province.

Her farm is currently run with the help of two farmhands.\r\n\r\nMagdaline had previously acquired two loans of 45,000 KES and 60,000 KES respectively, both of which were repaid promptly. She is currently requesting a loan of 90,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to build a zero grazing unit for her dairy animals at 50,000 KES, and to improve her farming by installing an irrigation system in her farm for her banana plantation, which requires consistent irrigation. She will use the loan specifically to buy a water tank and irrigation pipes. She says that finances are the farmer's main predicament; the high cost of labour and animal diseases are some pressing issues. She reiterates that the future is promising with Juhudi Kilimo loans together with the skills she has gathered in 17

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live together in their own home in the town of Santa Rosa, which is located in the beautiful tropical jungles of Peru. Honorata has always liked the idea of being the boss of her own business.  However, everything was not easy at the beginning.  She currently sells a significant amount of cacao and is very happy with the work that is being done.  Honorata has many more customers than she did before.  She usually works alone, but occasionally she will receive help from her husband.  During the planting and harvesting seasons, she hires laborers so that all the work gets finished in a short amount of time.  She normally sells her crops at the local collection centers.  Her future plans include buying additional farmland so that she can increase her productivity and improve the quality of life for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  Honorata promises to continue submitting her payments on time.  She says she receives many benefits as a result of being a member of her Communal Bank.  The loan she requested will be invested in the purchase supplies and compost so that her cacao crops receive ongoing maintenance.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":581920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase farming supplies & compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-16T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463078}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T21:26:54Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":225698,"name":"Nul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nul E., 36, is married and resides with her husband and six children in Kompong Chnang Province, Cambodia, an area known for quality palm products.

She is married and lives with her husband and their children. Her children are aged nine and four. \r\n\r\nRosa is a serious person. She is also hard-working and responsible. In her business, she makes children\u2019s pajamas. She began her own business three years ago with the intention of working to support her children while being able to keep them by her side as she worked.

Adalgiza initially had the experience of selling juice and \"bolis\" (frozen fruit treats) that she, herself, made but gradually started adding to her natural market assorted merchandise, candy and now even telephone services, an activity her son helps her with.  Her dream is to see her children become accomplished professionals and this is what motivates her to get up every day and go to work.  \r\n\r\nShe will use her Kiva loan, her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy cosmetics and candy and other merchandise to order that her customers have placed with her.  Her greatest challenge is having working capital to buy everything for cash and in large amounts and this is precisely what the Kiva loan will make possible for her.  Her customers are the children from day care centers, mothers in the community, neighbors and people her customers constantly refer to her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":861652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics, candy and other merchandise to order.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-06T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adalgiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73959},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80073},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81607},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":83171},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84766},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":86390},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":88046},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89734},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91453},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":93206},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94993},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":102602}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.26},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.26},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88.02,"local_amount":154032,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":157728.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614910},{"amount":46.63,"local_amount":81607,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":83565.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568858},{"amount":47.53,"local_amount":83171,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":85167.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780181},{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":84766,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":86800.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188574},{"amount":49.37,"local_amount":86390,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88463.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324792},{"amount":50.31,"local_amount":88046,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":90159.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038849},{"amount":51.28,"local_amount":89734,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91887.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651008},{"amount":52.26,"local_amount":91453,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":93647.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140612},{"amount":53.26,"local_amount":93206,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":95442.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100529},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":94993,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:11Z","rounded_local_amount":97272.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338151},{"amount":58.63,"local_amount":102602,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":105064.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394746}],"funded_date":"2011-10-02T10:45:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":336357,"name":"Cecelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecelia is 50 years old and lives in Jacob Town.

She is a very hardworking woman, and she lives with her family in the town of Poncaya, in the municipality of Catacamas. \r\n\r\nClaudia\u2019s work is buying and selling cattle. She began this work when her spouse, due to financial hardship, had to leave the country and left to find the American dream. As a woman she finds livestock management a little difficult, but she is not one to give in to adversity.

His wife and his three children live in his mother's home, a home that they care for because his mother lives in another city.  Since his parents moved to another city, he has been in charge of all of the farms, but, because of a lack of capital, he is not able to sow it like his father did, in large quantities.  But, he has the hopes of increasing his potato and pea crops each time.  It is very good to grow potatoes during this season, but, as the prices of fertilizers have increased, he has only sowed 10 sacks of seed.  In this next season, he will sow 20 sacks.  Aside from this, he just finished sowing one and a half bags of peas and he has kept seeds for his other farm that he is going to prepare because these grains do not produce well when kept for a long time.  Javier enjoys his work which depends on the times when he sows and grows to harvest good products and, above all, to be able to have a good price.  This is his fourth loan with MFP and he as been sworn in as the secretary of the community bank to which he belongs, committing to faithfully complete all of his activities and, at the same time, to motivate the other members to make their payments on time.  With the money he is requesting, he will buy 2 bags of pea seeds and fertilizer for his father's farm that he has sown. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":260467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de semillas y abono","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-25T16:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2070.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210849}],"funded_date":"2009-01-25T17:28:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joanna Silverman","image":null}},{"id":89665,"name":"Soli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soli S., 56, is married with 8 children.

Nasim is 47 years old. He is married and has two children. Nasim's goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life to get ahead and to fulfill his goals. He is a taxi driver who drives the streets of Khujand city in search of customers. He has owned his business for four years. Nasim\u2019s car needs a thorough repair, and he wants to borrow $600 USD for the term of 12 months. The financing will go towards general repairs of his vehicle. He thanks Kiva and all lenders who make this help possible.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to sufficient capital to fund viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The two older children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nRhoda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in multimedia services. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nRhoda is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 was used to fund operations of her multimedia services business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her ninth loan for PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital in her multimedia services business. Rhoda is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life. In the picture, Rhoda is with her husband at their business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":494957,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"As

Darleen has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Darleen joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Darleen is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":524040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is expecting that he can make up to $7-$8 per day if he can expand his microenterprise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":71209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

","en":"Julia, 35, is a hardworking and loving mother who lives in a rented home with her husband Ivan, 40, and their 3 minor children.  She wants to give her children a better life.\r\n\r\nShe works with her husband each day on the crops they are growing.  With a lot of effort, they have managed to make their lands very productive and now they cultivate everything, since they know that all of the products they obtain will be of a good quality.  They mainly plant peas, since pea stew is selling very well in the markets.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is to care for the crops so they can avoid the pests that can affect them.  She has been doing this work for 10 years and what she considers most difficult is to transport her harvested crops to the wholesale market of the city.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she hopes to gather together the money to have a stall in the wholesale market, since currently she sells as a street vendor.\r\n\r\nThis is Julia's 6th loan with MFP, and she feels that this loan will be a great help in developing her business.  In her communal bank she is proud of the fact that she is a very responsible member.  The 2,000 Peruvian soles requested will be used to improve her cultivations; to do this she will buy fertilizer and insecticides.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Merlyn is the group leader of a two member group loan offered by Kiva partner PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Merlyn T.\u2019s Group. \r\n\r\nMerlyn T. is 37 years-old and married to Dexter T.. They are blessed with two children who are school age. To make a living, she is presently engaged in banana production. Her husband is also giving her regular support from his income as a motor \u201cjabal-jabal\u201d driver. She\u2019s been engaged in her business for ten years. She earns an average amount of not less than Php 2,000.00 a month from sales from this business. \r\n\r\nIn the year 2007, Merlyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlyn, as an active member of Paglaum MPC under the PDP-LP, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities, has successfully repaid a loan amount of Php 10,000.00. She is now requesting a loan of Php 40,000.00 as her sixth loan. This loan will be used to purchase a second hand motorcycle. The future income from this business will be used to meet their basic needs, make loan repayments and pay for the children\u2019s education. She also joined PAGLAUM MPC because of the savings and insurance program offered by PAGLAUM MPC to its members. \r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She lives in Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $186. \r\n\r\nJuliet is borrowing 28,000 PHP so that she can fund her operations. This will be her 27th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Juliet aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He will use the Kiva loan to support labor costs and fertilizer during maize production: he needs to buy fertilizer in order to increase production. With the profits from farming, he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009).

He is the youngest of two brothers and he provides for his brother who is visually impaired. He lives with his mother and brother. <br\/>\r\nHemal completed high school and also took a course in Computer Science. He says he didn't continue his education due to his family's financial situation and has run his deceased father's store since 2006.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2006 he moved to Bela-Vista with his mother at his brother's request to help run the store. Bela-vista is the chief town of the District of Matutuine, in the Province of Maputo. All three now live in a house behind the store. Despite it being owned by all of them, Hemal is the primary manager of the store and opens from 8.30am until 7pm every day with no employees. He learnt how to do business from a wholesaler in Maputo where he was working until his brother asked for his help.\r\nThe emphasis in the store is on everyday necessities and the daily income is 1200,00 MZN, which Hemal is going to start saving. His biggest challenge in trying to expand the business is having a vehicle with which to transport the merchandise. <p>\r\n\r\nHe heard of Hluvuku through other merchants in the area and this is his first loan, be it with Hluvuku or any other institution. Hemal is confident he can improve his business with this loan and grow it well, given that he will be able to respond to his clients' demands.<p>\r\n In the future, he aims to sell a greater range of products and eventually open a computer repair workshop as none exist in the area.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHemal  tem 26 anos e nasceu na cidade de  Maputo, e \u00e9 solteiro. Ele \u00e9 o segundo entre dois  irm\u00e3os, sustenta o irm\u00e3o mais velho que tem problemas da vista e sua m\u00e3e ambos vivem na mesma casa e ele n\u00e3o tem filhos. <p>\r\n\r\nHemal completou o ensino secund\u00e1rio  (ate a 12a classe) tamb\u00e9m fez curso de inform\u00e1tica, diz que n\u00e3o continuou por situa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira da fam\u00edlia e desde 2006 esta gerindo a loja do falecido pai. Em 2007 se mudou para Bela-vista  junto com sua m\u00e3e  a pedido do seu irm\u00e3o para o ajudar na loja uma vez que o irm\u00e3o tem problemas de vista,  Bela-vista  \u00e9 uma vila sede do Distrito de Matutuine, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, onde Hemal vive com o irm\u00e3o e sua m\u00e3e na casa aos fundos da loja do seu falecido pai.<p>\r\n\r\nHemal \u00e9 o principal gestor da loja embora sendo bem comum, tem um hor\u00e1rio di\u00e1rio das 8:30h as 19:00h e n\u00e3o tem empregados. Aprendeu a fazer negocio numa loja grossista na cidade de Maputo onde se encontrava a trabalhar antes do irm\u00e3o o solicitar para vir ajuda-lo a gerir a loja. Os produtos com destaque s\u00e3o da primeira necessidade, o rendimento di\u00e1rio \u00e9 de 1200,00mt e diz que vai come\u00e7ar a poupar. Para ele o maior desafio para conseguir expandir o negocio \u00e9 ter uma viatura para ajudar no transporte de mercadoria.<p>\r\n\r\n\u00c9 primeiro empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e nunca teve nenhum empr\u00e9stimo em nenhuma institui\u00e7\u00e3o e conheceu Hluvuku atrav\u00e9s de outros comerciantes da zona. Hemal esta confiante que com este empr\u00e9stimo o negocio vai melhorar e vai crescer dado que poder\u00e1 responder bem a clientela.<p>\r\n\r\nOs objetivos com o negocio daqui em diante s\u00e3o vender produtos diversificados e futuramente abrir uma oficina de repara\u00e7\u00e3o de computadores uma vez que na zona n\u00e3o existe nenhuma."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":171683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

However, even staying at home and doing her regular housewife\u2019s duties; Nurjan manages to earn some money by selling milk. She sells up to ten liters daily, which allows her to make fifty dollars a month. It is a sizable amount of money, considering that they once invested just seventy dollars in buying a cow. And taking into account twenty years of a housewife\u2019s life, it is largely due to these humble earnings of hers and of course her husband\u2019s serious job that they have been able to refurnish their house, buy new domestic equipment, give their children a proper education and build a building opposite their house. <P>\r\n\r\nNurjan has decided to diversify her daily routine by keeping sheep. She intends to fatten them and resell them.  To do this, she is in need of a loan. Among her near-future plans is to marry off her son and build a new house. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nKamchybek, 37, is engaged in cattle breeding. He has a wife and three children.

He hopes to get a loan to buy materials for building a new shed. <P>\r\n\r\nKalima, 57, is a mother of three children. Her spouse is a math teacher at school. Ten years ago, they bought a calf.

B. is 37 years of age and lives in the Barrio Laureles Norte district. This is a district with precarious security and it is not the ideal family environment. She is a single mother of three children ages 21, 16 and 14. The youngest is attending school, while the two eldest are self-employed. Martha would like to perform some house improvements and so be able to offer her family a more confortable place to live. She has sold tortillas for six years, but her tortillas stand is now in bad condition and not adequate for the business, in particular during the winter season, when she gets completely wet because of the weather conditions. She is now requesting a loan to improve her working place; she will use it to buy construction materials, such as iron, cement and zinc. This will be the first step towards improvement, as the new conditions of her working place will allow her to prepare more tortillas and in the long term this will lead to a substantial financial and social change for the entire family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by MONICA URBAN, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":452229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T18:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.17,"local_amount":963.37,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841516},{"amount":44.03,"local_amount":880.65,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":915.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874440},{"amount":46.1,"local_amount":921.93,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":958.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604318},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":866.61,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":901.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639782},{"amount":42.9,"local_amount":858.08,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":892.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821564},{"amount":44.78,"local_amount":895.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561571},{"amount":44.18,"local_amount":883.58,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":918.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770505},{"amount":86.51,"local_amount":1730.24,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204400}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T00:59:47Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"MONICA URBAN","image":1592573}},{"id":167812,"name":"Roxana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nRoxana A.

Build the Future\u201d. The group members live in Sarapiqui, Heredia, a rural region close to the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The group members will use this loan for general investments in productive activities such as the rearing and selling of chickens and the purchase and sale of colognes and perfumes.\r\n\r\nChristina A. V. is the president of this group. She is always busy and engages in many economically productive activities such as curtain sewing, nail painting, selling retail products and poultry. This loan will be used for the purchase of chicks as well as feed for the rearing and sale of her poultry.\r\n\r\nChristina aspires to open a store one day where she can offer a range of services and products to her clients. She says her only obstacle is financial and that she works with her husband as a team: when Christina needs to work, her husband watches their daughter and vice versa (he is a taxi driver and farmer).\r\n\r\nDinia Gisselle G. G. is a 33-year-old mother who lives with her family in Sarapiqui. She has a business selling men\u2019s and women\u2019s colognes and perfumes in her community. She started her business with an initial investment of 100,000 colons. Her husband\u00b4s work requires him to travel to Panama roughly every fifteen days. In Panama the prices for quality perfume and cologne products is much less than in Sarapiqui. For example, a name brand perfume that sells for 12,000 colons in Panama sells for 22,000 colons in Sarapiqui.\r\n\r\nDinia has been selling perfumes and colognes for five years. She spends her days traveling to homes and restaurants in Sarapiqui, offering products to potential clients. She collects orders from her clients which she passes on to her husband who makes the necessary purchases when he arrives in Panama. Dinia says her business is growing; she wants to expand operations as the income she earns contributes significantly to her family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n\r\nDinia knows that she faces much competition in her community; there are many women selling similar products. As a result, she strives to provide superior service to her clients by bringing them all the products they request.\r\n\r\nSometimes, Dinia\u2019s clients have trouble paying for an item in full. In these cases Dinia organizes flexible payment schedules to suit the needs of her client. She hopes to one day open a store where she could sell not only perfumes and colognes, but clothing and cosmetics as well.\r\n\r\nDinia hopes that \u201cThe Womens Bank to Build the Future\u201d will expand and acquire more members from the community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":488977,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Oriental. She earns her living by engaging in a fishing business.\r\n\r\nFlorita\u2019s 40 year old husband, Lowim, owns and manages his own bakery business. They have 3 adult children. \r\n\r\nFlorita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a fishing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP20,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nFlorita is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP19,000 was used to fund the operations of her fishing business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 18th cycle loan, the amount of PHP19,000, which she intends to use on her fishing business.

She is married to Precilo S., a mason. She is the mother of four children, one of whom is already working while the other three are still in school, one in college and the other two in high school. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college - a dream for most Filipino parents like Jeanette as she herself was an elementary graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nJeanette operates a rug-making business. She mainly offers rugs, from those round, palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats, braided quilts and bed sheets, and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Besides rugs, Jeanette also retails bulk charcoal to her neighbors to be used as fuel for old-fashioned stoves. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and newspapers for patterns. She will also invest a portion of the loan to bulk buy sacks of charcoal to be repackaged and sold. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJeanette dreams to be able to give her all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Many times, her husbands catch was too small to cover even the most basic needs of the family, such as food for the day, much less provide for the education of her children, medicine for when a family member gets sick, and other expenses. \r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and went into the fish-selling business to supplement her husband's income and make her children's future more secure, because she knew that if she did not take the initiative, her children's future would be in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nSo, armed with her first loan from NWTF, she started selling her husband's catch, bought fish from some of the other fishermen, and sold them around the neighborhood and around the town for the next 10 years. This business enables her to earn an additional PHP 3,000 for her family.\r\n\r\nNow she hopes to expand her business by using her 9th loan of Php 15,000 as additional capital so that she can buy a bigger volume of fish from the local fishermen to sell to her growing number of loyal clients. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":382903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, the other wife of her husband and their children in Koko, one of the best-known districts of the town of Koutiala (Sikiasso region). For social reasons, Mrs. Sali did not have an opportunity to get an education, which explains her early interest in helping her mother in commerce. After trying several business activities without success, eleven years ago she finally turned to the purchase and resale of various articles such as fabrics. Sali\u2019s business is very popular with customers because of the quality of her goods. In order to expand her activity and satisfy customer demand, a year ago Sali has decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. After two joint (group) loans, she is now seeking her first individual loan. She plans to purchase a supply of fabrics in Cotonou. She sells in the town of Koutiala to a customer base composed of both women and men, for cash or in credit. She hopes to achieve a monthly income of 100,000 West African Francs, which she will use to repay her loan, contribute to the everyday family expenses and reinvest the rest into her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva

comportamiento de las abejas y  de las colmenas;  as\u00ec fue como hace 18 a\u00f1os gracias a un funcionario del I.C.A.  (Instituto Colombiano agropecuario)  que llev\u00f3 este arte a Sabanalarga su pueblo, inici\u00f3 con 10 colmenas, con una inversi\u00f3n de $380.000, y gradualmente fue adquiriendo mas en las poblaciones de Sabanalarga, cascajal, Polonuevo, Caracol, Piojo, Galapa y Manat\u00ed, hasta completar  hoy 235,  de d\u00f3nde saca la pura miel, que \u00e9l mismo se encarga de empacar en su casa,  ubicada en el municipio de Malambo, en envases de 360 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos y de 72 respectivamente y las  distribuye en  almacenes de productos naturistas, restaurante vegetarianos , distribuidores mayorista y al granel, a personas que quieren consumirla como parte de su r\u00e9gimen alimenticio .\n Juan Bautista  vende al por mayor mediante el sistema de  consignaci\u00f3n y le pagan a los 15 d\u00edas y al granel  le pagan de contado los frascos de 360 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos los vende a $8.000 COP y los de 720 cent\u00edmetros c\u00fabicos  a    $ 16.000  COP. En la actualidad Solicita su credikiva como segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para comprar 4.200 l\u00e1minas de cera, estampado para los panales  y 1.800 envases de vidrio para empacar la pura miel y prepararse para la cosecha que se inicia en Noviembre.\nJuan Bautista a\u00fan recuerda como antes sin ninguna protecci\u00f3n los apicultores se acercaban a las abejas solo con expeler  un suave humo; esto era, aclara,  cuando no hab\u00edan abejas africanizadas, hasta que llegaron unos especialistas chinos y los indujeron a ello,  sin importar que fueran abejas criollas o no. Y es que \u00e9l parte de la premisa que si los humanos no molestamos sus abejas, ellas no atacan pero que de todas maneras \u00e9l siempre se protege para atender medidas de seguridad. Tambi\u00e9n plantea desde su experiencia como un buen observador y seguidor emp\u00edrico, que las fugas masivas de abejas en algunas partes del mundo obedecen a que ellas son  muy sensibles a los aparatos electr\u00f3nicos, celulares y medios modernos que  no lo resisten por su misma naturaleza.\nJuan Bautista y su esposa, que trabaja en el arte de confecciones mediante el sistema de maquilas,  con sus esfuerzos han apoyado su hogar y lo han  sacado adelante a sus 3 hijos ya profesionales. \u00c9l sue\u00f1a hoy con    perfeccionar su arte de cultivar abejas para extraer  su rica miel, haciendo el proceso lo m\u00e1s natural posible y convirti\u00e9ndolo en un ejemplo internacional.\n\n\n","en":"Juan Bautista Rodr\u00edguez is a man who knows a lot about bees and honey production.  The honey is very pure, and how could it not be, if he devotes himself to being a beekeeper.  He learned this trade when he was very young.  He would escape from school and go to the farms to learn about bee behavior and their hives.  This was how 18 years ago, thanks to an official from the I.C.A. (Colombian Agricultural Institute) who took this art to his town of Sabanalarga, he started with ten hives with an investment of $380.000. \r\n\r\nHe gradually was acquiring more hives in the towns of Sabanalarga, Cascajao, Polonuevo, Caracol, Piojo, Galapa, and Manat\u00ed.  He now has 235 from which he takes pure honey.  He sees to packing the honey himself.  He does this at his home, which is located in the Malambo municipality.  He packs the honey in containers that are 360 centimeters by 72 centimeters.  He delivers the packages of honey to stores that sell natural products, vegetarian restaurants, wholesale distributors, and in bulk to people who want to eat it as part of their nutritional regimen.\r\n\r\nJuan Bautista sells wholesale through a consignment system.  They pay him every 15 days, and he is paid cash for bulk sales.  He sells the bottles that are 360 cubic centimeters for $8.000 COP, and he sells the bottles that are 720 centimeters for $16.000 COP.\r\n\r\nHe is currently requesting his second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will buy 4.200 sheets of wax, comb foundation for the honeycomb, and 1.800 glass bottles to pack the pure honey and to prepare to start the harvest in November.  \r\n\r\nJuan Bautista still remembers how beekeepers would approach the bees without any protection by just blowing out mild smoke.  \u201cThis was,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen there were not African bees.\u201d  That was until some Chinese specialists came and introduced them without caring whether or not they were Columbian bees.  \r\n\r\nAside from the premise that if humans do not bother the bees they will not attack, he always protects himself in order to comply with security measures.  Also, from his experience of being a good observer and empirical follower, he states that the massive flight of bees in some parts of the world is due to the fact that they are very sensitive to electronic apparatus, cell phones, and modern media.  By nature they cannot resist them.\r\n\r\nJuan Bautista and his wife work in the art of making textiles in factories.  Through their efforts they have supported their household, and they have gotten their three children, who are now professionals, ahead.  \r\n\r\nHe now dreams of perfecting his art of cultivating bees in order to extract their delicious honey.  He makes the process as natural as possible, and he will turn it into an international example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
