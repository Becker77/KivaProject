Boda boda drivers pick up and drop off pay-as-you-go passengers as a motorcycle taxi.  Emmanuel operates from the municipal business center, where there is a constant flow of customers, and he has been in this business for 1 year.  \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is married and has 4 children, 3 boys and 1 girl, from 8 to 15 years old. The primary business challenges he faces are stiff competition from competitors with more than one motorcycle plus regular breakdowns of his motorbike.   His wife is a tailor\/dressmaker, a business Emmanuel was involved in before driving his motorcycle.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel plans to use the 60,000 Kenyan Shilling loan to purchase a second motorcycle.  He has successfully repaid three previous loans of 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 Shillings.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Emmanuel hopes to buy his own land and build a home.  In 5 years, he dreams of having at least five motorcycles operating as boda bodas and being involved in the taxi business.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as hard-working, humble, and humorous.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":554098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  General Store, Ready-to-Wear Clothes and Food Vending businesses.  Her husband, Novelito C., who is 45 years old, works as a Security Guard to earn his living. They have three children who are between the ages of 12 and 19. \r\n\r\nLetresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $140, thus raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th cycle cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase new products for her businesses so that she can continue to save up for the future and send her children to school. Letresita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His wife stays at home to take care of household chores while James goes out every day to provide for his family. They have one child aged 3 years old whom they hope to educate to university level. James has been running a studio and selling picture frames to local people for three years. His business is located in Mwingi and he is served by SMEP's Thika branch.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nelson G., age 45 and unmarried, is willing to take on that goal even as he lives out the spirit of entrepreneurship. Nelson reached college level in his education and is now pursuing his own business. One way in in which he helps is offering financial support to a family member. He has lived in Silang, Cavite, for five years. During that time, Nelson has operated a pig raising business and a farm. He is adept at raising healthy pigs to offer for for sale and has a true green thumb when it comes to producing quality crops. He is well aware of the techniques and the seasons involving these agricultural small-scale businesses, and this level of experience allows him to earn Php 6,000 every month. Nelson employs one person to help him with the routine tasks of the business.\r\n\r\nTo help him grow his business, he is applying for a Php 40,000 loan. He will purchase pig feed and fertilizer for his farm with this money. Also, he plans to take measures to maintain the condition of his farm. His business requires real effort, and the loan will be a great help toward sustaining his business.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the production of piglets in his piggery has recently greatly affected his business. But rather than focusing on his loss, Nelson aspires toward raising thirty productive sows in a set span of time. Greater than this business goal is his overarching aim of being able to serve the Lord in whatever he does, which leads eventually to serving others for His name\u2019s sake. Nelson also dreams of going abroad to work someday.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The group members live in the same neighborhood. In order to increase their working capital and to diversify their business, this group is asking for their third loan from ALIDE.  Francisca Ablawa is 64-years old and married to a retired soldier named Celestin.  The couple have five children, all in school, two of which remain in their care.  Francsica Ablawa lives with her family and ensures together with her husband the various household expenses. Francisca did not attend school.  For about 10 years, Francisca has been in the business of selling condiments, rice, and smoked fish in her neighborhood.  This business generates income that helps her contribute to family expenses.  Francsica Ablawa buys her products in Benin. This third loan will certainly enable Francisca Ablawa and other members of the AYESSI group enhance the level of their business and grow their number of customers and their income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":904108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to purchase condiments, bags of rice, and fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T08:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca Ablawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ka\u00ef Marcelline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":330000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":39000},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29000},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":28000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.73},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":165.45,"local_amount":78000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:08:42Z","rounded_local_amount":78054.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244501814},{"amount":82.73,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":39027.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251062167},{"amount":82.73,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":39027.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257112376},{"amount":82.73,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":39027.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263237489},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":39027.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269962101},{"amount":82.73,"local_amount":39000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":39027.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276569519},{"amount":61.52,"local_amount":29000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":29020.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283059596},{"amount":59.39,"local_amount":28000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":28019.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287417569}],"funded_date":"2011-11-25T02:04:29Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:13:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":355197,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom (in the photo) and her husband, Sarom, are vegetable and flower farmers.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":255831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T04:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436380},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130652},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027449},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613450},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010530},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232826}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T05:54:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":87995,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en Villa libertad, con dos hijos de 19 y 24 a\u00f1os de edad, el mayor es independiente y el otro estudia, su esposo se desempe\u00f1a como operario de maquina en  una de las empresas de zona franca.

Desde muy joven tuvo que trabajar muy duro para el bienestar de los suyos, ya que su madre lleg\u00f3 a la capital sin una moneda, teniendo que mantener a cuatro hijos entre los cuales se encontraba Liliana. Aun peque\u00f1a tuvo la necesidad de apoyar a su madre que se desempe\u00f1aba como costurera para poder mantenerlos, felizmente su arduo trabajo dio frutos y pudo comprar un peque\u00f1o terreno donde se trasladaron a vivir entre esteras, esto en el distrito de Ventanilla en Lima.

They also live with the children\u2019s father, Andr\u00e9s, who is 42.  They have their own house.  Since she was very young she has had to work very hard for the well being of her family.  Her mother arrived in the capital with no money, and she had to take care of her four children.  Even though she was little, Liliana had to help her mother, who worked as a seamstress, to support her family.  Happily, her hard work paid off.  She was able to buy a small piece of land where they lived in the swamps in the Ventanilla district of Lima.  \r\n\r\nNow, Liliana remembers the efforts her mother, her siblings, and she made in the different jobs they had to do to generate income for their home.  There is no job that they would not do: from making jewelry; selling gelatin; organizing fried chicken dinners; selling clothes; etc.  She has even more business ideas in her head.  \r\n\r\nShe now has a small store, which little by little she has been stocking, in order to get the income she needs.  Liliana thinks that it is not hard work.  One simply needs to have the desire, put forth the effort, and success will follow.

They are motivation behind all of her hard work.  Eva's business is located in a cold Peruvian city near a mine and is a store that carries automotive lubricants. Her store is one of the most popular as she always has the latest goods.

The most difficult part of her job is transporting her products as the trips are long and full of difficulties and the lubricants need to be very well sealed so that they don't leak. Over time, she hopes to expand her store as demand is increasing.

She is 54 years old. Reynaida is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she runs a sari-sari (variety) retail store, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Reynaida has been engaged in her business for over twenty-five years and earns approximately $300 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Reynaida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. She is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

His wife, Magali, who is still studying at the University and who will complete her Law Degree in two years, sells cosmetics on credit. They have a daughter of school age, and they live in the Alto Pampahasi area, 25 minutes from the city center. Franklin has been working as a taxi driver for seven years, but one and a half years ago he bought his own vehicle, and he is very happy because now he has more time to spend with his family. Tuesday is his established day off, as there is a rule in our town governing traffic according to which every car has no access to the urban area for one day of the week: the day is determined by each car\u2019s license plate number. Franklin uses his day off to check his vehicle. He has been working with our institution for a few months, during which he has demonstrated being responsible man and accurate with his payments. In this occasion he is asking for a loan to provide for the general maintaining of his

Tapon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns a living by operating a beauty salon. Her husband, Eduardo O. who is 42 years old, works as a barber and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 5 children who are 10 to 19 years old. \r\n\r\nMaristela  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maristela  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 45,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 75,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 49,500 which she intends to use as additional working capital and to purchase equipment for her beauty salon. She can then continue to save up for the future and security of her children. Maristela O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She bought her own sewing machines and has been working in this business for 16 years.\n\nShe is requesting a loan to buy a basic sewing machine, and also material such as fabric, thread, zippers and snaps. This will strengthen her business and allow her to have materials available for making the clothing that her customers request, so that she can increase the number of garments she offers.\n\nHer goal is to get more machines to increase her production and to provide better service to her customers via the suits, dresses and pants she produces.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Albert, an employee, and is mother to their four children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nAida operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also earns additional income from selling cooked viands. Her store is located near the roadside of their community. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAida hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":876896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for additional items to resell in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-24T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":391.67,"local_amount":16667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":17022.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571784},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8332.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8510.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529334},{"amount":244.79,"local_amount":10417.04,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10639.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738551},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":8332.93,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8510.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145805},{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":6250.07,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6383.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274792}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T22:09:46Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":342907,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita is 54 years old and lives in the Philippines.

This group-lending methodology ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and families.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":93658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"She will use the next loan from Esperanza to invest in more fishing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Saman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-12-08T00:25:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oferlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T04:52:21Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120023},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140182},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163713},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188690},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-05-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216632},{"amount":155,"local_amount":5057.89,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5178.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245533}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T04:52:21Z","paid_date":"2008-06-22T09:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30644,"name":"Noem\u00ed","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Noem\u00ed is a young girl who recently got married.

Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

Usmonbek is a 37-year-old businessman. He is married and together with his wife they have 4 children. Usmonbek is a farmer, like his wife. They started their work 15 years ago. The beginning was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his wife, he was able to move forward and today has a large plot of land. \r\n\r\nHis vegetables are very good quality which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. Usmonbek requests the loan for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide for her family. A dream for most Filipino parents like Lourdes, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLourdes operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food.

He sells fruit, soft drinks, bread and cold meats.  He has had this business since 2007 when he only maD. and sold bread.  He later added a snack bar and started selling fruit and meat.  Rafael only sells the bread and wheat-flour-based products that he bakes in his bakery which is well positioned.  In addition to Rafael, an employee, his wife and one of his daughters also work in the business.  It has a good turnover of customers because, as well as being located on a corner, there is also a large school in the area and the students are always buying from him.\r\n\r\nRafael's contribution margin is 35% and he currently has a net profit that will allow him to cover his expected loan instalments.  His family and operating expenses are similar.  His accounts payable are low and he doesn't sell much on credit.  Most of his total assets are fixed assets.  He currently has  low debts and all are short term.  His working capital ratio is good because he has low debts.  His inventory turnover period is quite high because many of his products are perishable.  His profit on sales is 21% owing to his high contribution margin.  His business is very profitable and he has good creditworthiness.  His goal is to better equip his snack bar with fixtures and fittings that will allow him to proviD. a better service to his customers.\r\n\r\nRafael is approaching Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for his first loan through Kiva in order to buy bakery and snack bar supplies wholesale such as wheat flour, sugar, fat and fruit.

menores hijos en una casa alquilada que les facilit\u00f3 un familiar de ella.\n\nC\u00e9sar est\u00e1 seguro que s\u00f3lo se sale adelante con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n, y mejor a\u00fan cuando se trabaja en lo que mejor se sabe hacer. Por eso, desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, junto a su esposa, siembra en terrenos arrendados papa y arveja, y tambi\u00e9n cr\u00edan tres asnos que le ayudan a trasladar los insumos y herramientas agr\u00edcolas hacia sus terrenos. Lo que m\u00e1s lo motiva es cosechar, pues le permite apreciar la calidad de producci\u00f3n que obtuvo. Por otro lado le disgusta tener que caminar hasta m\u00e1s de una hora para labrar su chacra, pero no se da por vencido porque considera que su labor le es muy rentable, ya que nunca ha perdido lo invertido sino por el contrario le alcanza para solventar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, cubrir los gastos dom\u00e9sticos e incluso para ahorrar. Para m\u00e1s adelante planea construir su casa propia y comprar m\u00e1s hect\u00e1reas de tierra que le den mayores ingresos para que pueda brindarle una adecuada calidad de vida a su familia.    \n\nEste es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y como ya conoce la metodolog\u00eda de trabajo de su banco comunal, est\u00e1 muy gustoso de continuar laborando activamente con su grupo, el cual est\u00e1 integrado por personas que respetan lo establecido en su reglamento interno y son puntuales en los pagos. Con el dinero ahora solicitado tiene pensado comprar una bolsa y media de semilla de arveja, cinco sacos de fertilizantes y tres botellas de insecticidas para fumigar sus sembr\u00edos.","en":"C\u00e9sar is 34 years old.  He lives with his 29-year-old wife Susana and their 3 small children in a house that they rent from a relative of hers.\r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar is sure that he can get ahead with effort and dedication, because when he works he knows that it is what he does best.  For 10 years now he and his wife have planted potatoes and peas on the fields that they rent, and have also raised three donkeys that help them to transport the supplies and agricultural tools to the fields.  What motivates C\u00e9sar the most is harvesting, since it allows him to appreciate the quality of the crop that he has obtained.  On the other hand, what he doesn\u2019t like is having to walk for mO. than an hour to work on his farm.  He doesn\u2019t give up, though, because he considers his work very worthwhile, since he has never lost what he has invested; on the contrary, he has managed to pay for his children\u2019s education, meet his household\u2019s expenses, and even to save some money.  To get further ahead he plans to construct his own house and purchase mO. hectares of land that would give him mO. income.

He is very happy to continue to work actively with his group, which is made up of people who respect the group\u2019s established rules and who are punctual in their payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Its target is improving the living conditions of its members through economic activities, education, cultural and social activities, the creation of solidarity within the fellowship and mutual assistance to members. The members are in the 26-52 age group. All members are illiterate except the secretary that manages administrative and bookkeeping documents. The fellowship already received three credits of $400;$1000, and $1500 that were all reimbursed smoothly. \r\n \r\nJust like the entire Ahonkp\u00e8 village, this group of women is confronted with a serious problem of potable water. The consequences are very dramatic in a village where child mortality rate is very high. The main drinking water source is a stagnant water pool exposed to all sort of water born diseases. So they had the interesting humanitarian idea of realising a drilling with views to providing the village with potable water to guarantee the health of the population chiefly the children. \r\n\r\nOn that purpose, the female fellowship \u201cNOVISSI of Ahonkp\u00e8\u201d applied for a credit of $ 2000 to achieve its project of water drilling in order to sell water to the entire population of the village. Financing this project is not only an economic action but also a humanitarian one: it will help contribute to the reduction of the child mortality rate in the village of Ahonkp\u00e8, in the suburban area of Lom\u00e9. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nNOVISSI de Ahonkp\u00e8 est un groupe de solidarit\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 de douze (12) femmes cr\u00e9\u00e9 il y a quatre (04) ans.

L\u2019\u00e2ge des membres varie entre 26 ans et 52 ans. Tous les membres sont analphab\u00e8tes \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la secr\u00e9taire qui tient les documents administratifs et comptables. Le groupement a d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de trois cr\u00e9dits respectivement de $400, $1000 et $1500 qui sont tous bien rembours\u00e9s sans incident.\r\n\r\nCe groupe de femme tout comme le village de Ahonkp\u00e8 est confront\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me s\u00e9rieux d\u2019eau potable. Les cons\u00e9quences sont tr\u00e8s dramatiques dans ce village o\u00f9 le mortalit\u00e9 enfantine est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9. La principale eau de consommation est un point d\u2019eau stagnante expos\u00e9 \u00e0 toute sorte de maladie hydrique. Alors, elles ont eu cette id\u00e9e g\u00e9niale et humanitaire de faire un forage afin de doter le village d\u2019eau potable pour garantir la bonne sant\u00e9 de la population surtout celle des enfants. \r\n\r\nA cet effet, le groupement f\u00e9minin \u00ab NOVISSI de Ahonkp\u00e8 \u00bb sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 pour r\u00e9aliser son projet de forage dont l\u2019eau sera vendue \u00e0 la population. Financer ce projet, est un acte non seulement \u00e9conomique mais plut\u00f4t humanitaire : contribuer \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction du taux de mortalit\u00e9 enfantine dans le village de Ahonkp\u00e8, banlieue de Lom\u00e9. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":5321,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water

A., 32 years of age and a native of Nampula, did not attend school beyond the 5th grade because of the war. He arrived in the province of Maputo in the company of his oldest sibling in 1995 and encountered the necessity of starting a small business in an ambulatory regime. Later, he acknowledged this endeavor as a good idea now that the conditions of starting a business had already materialized in a fixed location, also because he had married and needed to better organize his life. Today he is a father of 2 children. Through his neighbors he obtained information about the services provided by Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner), who he approached and solicited an initial low-cost loan. He was able to open a bank account and start a small savings in case of an emergency. Right now, he employs 4 people and supports the basic familial expenses. With this loan he intends to expand his business by diversifying the products he sells. His business\u2019 impact on the community is a positive one: he provides employment for himself, his wife and his sister-in-law; he places the product as close as possible to the consumers of his village. His future plans include expanding the business and offering employment to more people in the community. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Armando A. de 32 anos de idade, natural de Nampula por causa de guerra n\u00e3o conseguiu estudar para alem da 5 classe.\r\nChegou na prov\u00edncia de Maputo na companhia do seu irm\u00e3o mais velho em 1995 e viu a necessidade de iniciar um pequeno neg\u00f3cio em regime ambulat\u00f3rio mais tarde achou por bem e j\u00e1 criada as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fazer o neg\u00f3cio no local fixo tamb\u00e9m porque j\u00e1 tinha se casado e precisava organizar-se melhor.\r\n\r\nHoje \u00e9 pai de 2 filhos e conta que atrav\u00e9s dos vizinhos obteve a informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os servi\u00e7os que a HLUVUKU ADSEMA presta \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Boane, tendo aproximado e solicitado o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo num valor bastante reduzido tendo em conta as capacidades de financiamento da institui\u00e7\u00e3o. \r\n\r\nConseguiu abrir uma conta banc\u00e1ria e come\u00e7ou a fazer pequenas poupan\u00e7as para os momentos de crise.

For this reason, he had to abandon his studies and start making money to provide for his family. He was trained as a tailor by several master tailors in the city of Sikasso. After 17 years of experience, he became a master tailor known all over Sikasso. His workshop, located in the grand market, is a melting pot of styles and designs, and is very much visited by a diverse clientele.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy an increasing number of ever more demanding requests from his customers, he decided to join the loan program of the microfinance organisation Soro Yiriwaso, in order to buy a new embroidery machine, seven pieces of tinted \"bazin\" (a sort of damask) in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali), and 200 meters of men's fabric in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso, Western Africa).

This is 48-year-old Edda M. from Tukuyu. She is married and has four children between the ages of 15 and 20. Edda has run a timber-selling business since 2004, buying wood from the forest and selling it in towns.\r\n\r\nShe works four hours a day, seven days a week and has one employee. Edda currently earns about $400 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to purchase additional timber. In the future, she plans to increase her stock even further -- and by doing that, expand her small company. Edda thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Since she separated from her husband, she has had to take on the role of both father and mother in her home, which is very difficult.  But she has the support of her parents, who offered her their home and their affection.  With all of the problems she had to go through, she never stopped being an optimist with regard to her future.  She had all of the strength necessary to work in many jobs to pay for her home's expenses and saved enough to have her own business with her sister.  Now they are planning to obtain another stand in the market.  However, to accomplish this, they will have to keep selling starting at 6:00 a.m.  Mothers start visiting the markets very early so they can have the afternoons free to attend to the needs of their homes.  \r\n\r\nShe never stops caring for her children in spite of the hard work she does during the day.  This is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  It helps her to know that her responsibility within her group isn't only making her payments, but also the friendship and solidarity that the members have.  It isn't easy to interact and to learn how to work in a team.  The amount she is requesting will go towards acquiring another stand in the market and to increase her amount of products and capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":309394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase another stand in the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-26T02:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":336.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596127},{"amount":112.66,"local_amount":346.66,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":349.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990394},{"amount":116.5,"local_amount":358.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":361.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211516},{"amount":122.38,"local_amount":376.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":379.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641023},{"amount":126.75,"local_amount":390.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":393.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080482},{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":196.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996641}],"funded_date":"2009-04-26T04:39:38Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":108523,"name":"Yataka Moyo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatma has been a bites (bread-like rolls) seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for ten years.

Jhonny serves as a security policeman in a super market in the western zone of Cochabamba city.  According to the owner of the super market, Jhonny is a very trustworthy, responsible, and hard-working person who complies with all the norms of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nJhonny lives in the Cero Verde zone of Cochabamba in a rental house.  After several years of saving money he was able to buy a house lot in the Huallani zone, located in the Eastern sector of Cochabamba.  But they lacked the funds to be able to construct their house.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the loan will be used to construct a house, enabling them to move and avoid paying rent.  This will fulfill their dream of having their own home and a place where their children can feel comfortable. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es sembrar sus tierras y ver como sus cultivos van creciendo, lleva 5 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es cuidar sus campos agr\u00edcolas de los cultivos. Con el tiempo, espera comprar m\u00e1s tierras y as\u00ed ampliar la cantidad de su producci\u00f3n. Este es el octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, en su primer cr\u00e9dito fue muy puntual con el pago de sus cuotas y espera serlo ahora tambi\u00e9n. En su grupo comunal es una social muy alegre, motivo por el cual es muy querida por el resto de sus compa\u00f1eras. Con los tres mil nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s abono para mejorar sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"Dolores, who is 31 years old, is a simple and hard working mother.  She lives in her parents' house with her 29 year old husband, Joel, and their 2 beloved children, to whom they want to give a better quality of life.  The arduous work days that Dolores has spent on her small farm have served to improve her crop and make her land more productive.  She works together with her older daughter starting very early in the morning.  They cultivate potatoes and beans, products that she will later bring to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma to sell.  What she likes best about her work is sowing her land and seeing her crops grow.  She has been in this business for 5 years and feels that the most difficult part is taking care of the crops on her farmland. With time, she hopes to purchase more land and increase her production quantity.  This is her eighth loan with MFP.  She was very timely in the repayment of her first loan, and she expects to be so now as well.  She is a very happy member of her communal bank, which is why she is well liked by the rest of the members.  With the 3000 PEN ($1075 USD) that she is requesting, she will purchase more fertilizer to improve her crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":578444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purhcase more sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3030.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269247}],"funded_date":"2010-08-08T19:52:49Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":224091,"name":"Phoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Phoeun K., age 34 (pictured here) and his wife, Mrs. Nang Un, age 31, are vegetable farmers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mary is an enterprising business woman who has been running her business for the past 6 years. The food items she sells are highly-favored staple foods on most food markets and at homes in Ntungamo and most parts of Western Uganda.\r\n\r\nMary is an exception to the rule. Notwithstanding the fact that she is divorced, she has showed fortitude in the face of hardship. It is a trait which is a rarity in most Ugandan women. She says that the odds were stacked against her but due to her strong resolve, she was not fazed. Her approach was to work assiduously to better her own welfare and that of her family. The entry into her business, just like any other business, was formidable but she remained firm in the face of the hurdles she encountered.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, affirmative action programs have been invaluable to her, just like they have been to many women entrepreneurs all across Uganda. Farming is the second string to her bow and, needless to say, her farms provide all the food items she sells after harvesting.\r\nMary says that her monthly sales income totals up to Uganda shillings 800,000.

He is married and has two sons and three daughters. He is a taxi driver who earns a low income. Mo'ammar wants to make some necessary repairs to his taxi such as painting, changing the engine, changing the doors, etc. However, the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay for this, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Mo'ammar gets the loan, he will pay the expenses for making repairs to his taxi. This will improve the taxi conditions and enable Mo'ammar to work extra hours and take more requests. This will allow him to increase his income and create better living conditions for his family. Mo'ammar is photographed next to his taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see for the fund-raising includes both the principal loan and the loan-servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending help text: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

24-year-old young woman. She is married and has one son. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Mona wants to change the old refrigerator that doesn't preserve food well and also wants to get new bedroom furniture so that she and her son live in comfortable and healthy home conditions. Mona wants to take a loan from FATEN to complete the amount of money she has to pay. When she gets the loan, she will purchase new refrigerator for her kitchen and new bedroom furniture for her and her son. This will enable her to improve her family life and live in better conditions. \n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange, and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending help text: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\n \n\n\n

Khaled wants to improve his home living conditions by purchasing a new refrigerator. The old one has a cooling problem and doesn't preserve food well. Getting this loan from FATEN will enable Khaled to purchase a new refrigerator that will preserve his food safely, providing Khaled with better and healthier living conditions. Khaled is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

n":"Amal is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead.\n\nAmal is a mother of two sons and two daughters all of whom are school students. Amal wants to complete the purchase of necessary home furniture such as: bedroom furniture for her children, dinning room furniture and living room seats so that she can offer her family better home living conditions. Yet, the amount of money she has isn't enough to buy these things, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. Getting this loan will enable Amal to purchase necessary home furniture that she doesn't have in her house which will offer her family better and comfortable living conditions at home. \n\nAbout this loan product:\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\n \n\n

Kamil has 10 years of experience already in raising and selling cattle. During these years, Kamil has acquired the knowledge and skills required for the business. \r\n\r\nHe usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them and sells the meat in Imishli livestock bazaar.  Looking after cattle is hard and requires spending a lot of time in the open air. The climate is very severe, very hot in the summer and very cold in winter.  However, Kamil is not alone in his business, because his wife and elder son help to pasture and feed the animals. \r\n\r\nHis monthly profit is 250 AZN. He wishes to expand his business to improve the life of his family. For this purpose, he applied for a 1000 AZN loan.  He will use this loan to purchase two cattle and fodder.
