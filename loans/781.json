His monthly profit from selling foods is 120 AZN. His wife helps him to sell products in the shop. He is a very successful entrepreneur because of his good location in the central bazaar of his home city.\r\n\r\nThe profit he earns is not enough to reinvest in the business and covering customer demands is suffering for this reason. Being only one source of income, his profit is used for family needs. Hafiz would like to increase his sales and invest additional capital in the business. For this purpose, he applied for a loan of 2,000 AZN. He will purchase and diversify additional foodstuffs. This will be his fourth loan and he has a good credit history.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":964365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He has ten years of experience in this field and is a knowledgeable and skilled person.\r\n\r\nRasim usually buys small calves, raises and fattens them, and resells them in the livestock bazaar for meat.  Looking after cattle is hard and requires spending a lot of time in the open air. The climate is very severe: it is very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.  However, Rasim is not alone in his business - his father helps to pasture and feed the animals. \r\n\r\nMeat and milk products are very popular products in Azerbaijan. People drink fresh milk and homemade yoghurt everyday and consider it very healthy. Every national dish contains meat, such as pilau and dolma.\r\n\r\nRasim's monthly profit is 120 AZN. He wishes to expand his business in order to improve life for his family. So, he has applied for a loan of 1,800 AZN.  He will use this loan to purchase one dairy cow, two beef cattle, and fodder.  This will be his fourth loan and he has a good credit

is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead in the FATEN branch. \n\nNiveen, who is a 34-year-old young woman, is a mother of three sons and two daughters. Her husband is a municipality employee with a decent salary, but his salary isn't enough to cover all his family expenses through the month. Niveen lacks some home appliances and furniture. She needs to purchase new dinning room furniture,  bedroom furniture for her children and a washing machine, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Niveen gets the loan, she will purchase all the home appliances and furniture she needs, so she will create for her family better and more comfortable living conditions. \n\nAbout this loan product:\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

The loan will enable Samiya to offer her family needed home appliances that are otherwise not affordable to them and that will provide easier and better life conditions.\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

For three years he has had a store for selling used washing machines and refrigerators after making some repairs to them. This is his only source of income. \r\n\r\nMonther wants to purchase engines to put into the used washing machines and refrigerators he has in the store, but the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay for the engines. He needs to take a loan from FATEN to have enough money to pay for them. Getting this loan will offer to Monther the needed engines to repair the used washing machines and refrigerators he has, and then resell them for good prices, as he has loyal customers. \r\n\r\nThis will enable Monther to improve his store and increase his sales and income so he can live in better conditions. \r\n\r\nMonther is photographed in his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is a taxi driver and this is the only source of income for his family. Wa'el wants to own a taxi and he needs to complete the price of purchasing a taxi. Therefore, he is requesting a loan from Kiva partner FATEN. When Wa'el gets the loan, he will be able to complete the purchase. The purchase of the taxi will give him the chance to work freely, and take extra internal and external requests. His income will increase and he will be able to give his family better living conditions. Wa'el is shown in the picture.\r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product<\/b>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed in the store.\n\nFalasteen, a 30 year old young woman, is a mother to three sons and two daughters. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. For the past four years, he has also had a store for selling paints and decoration items. He wants to expand his store by purchasing more of these goods, but the amount of money he has isn't enough to cover the purchases and pay for his family's expenses. Falasteen has decided to help him in acquiring the funds by getting a loan from FATEN. \n\nWhen Falasteen gets the loan, she will enable her husband to expand the store. They will purchase paint in bulk quantities and the decoration items that are necessary for the expansion. This will, in turn, increase his sales and his income and offer him the ability to provide better living conditions for the family.\n\nAbout this loan product:\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\n

His children are still little.  His wife is a homemaker.  Valijon has been involved in raising and fattening up livestock for over ten years.  He grew up in a poor family of a dekhan farmer and has been used to work since childhood.  His love of hard work helps him to get himself up on his feet.  Because he lives in a village, there is no permanent work.  All of the work is seasonal, and this is why Valijon is involved in animal husbandry.  Currently, he is experiencing serious difficulties with building a barn and stocking up on animal feed.  Valijon is requesting a loan in the sum of 4000 Somoni to purchase livestock and fodder for it in order to expand his business.  He relies on your help and mercy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":964943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Jos\u00e9 is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy: 15 tanks of propane gas per week, beans, rice by the quintal, soap by the case and also milk.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will buy products that he does not have in stock and will buy more of those he does have.  At the same time he will be able to buy at a better price since he used to have to limit himself.  Concurrently, he will offer a better variety of products to his customers so will sell more and obtain better income.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 hopes to have a larger store because there are more than 800

Ica is a warm and affectionate city that is well known as the Land of the Eternal Sun because of its warm climate in any season of the year, with its majestic dunes and its very well-known Huacachina Lagoon.  The residents are very warm and welcoming, as well as being fighters, because in spite of the 2007 earthquake they have not let themselves be defeated by adversity and they are moving forward.\r\n\r\nWilfredo is one of them.  He is a real fighter and above all he loves his work.  He lives with his partner with whom he has three children, ages 18, 15, and 3.  The oldest, the 18-year-old, is studying in the university.  His 15-year-old child is in the fourth year of high school and the youngest of all is not yet in school but is inquisitive and above all very affectionate.  His partner helps him a lot in everything he does in spite of being a surgeon in a health center.  Both of them work very hard to get ahead, for their children above all, because the only legacy they can leave them is their studies.  He mentioned to us that he would have liked to be a civil engineer.  In his spare time Wilfredo enjoys reading some books he has at home, and his favorite dishes are ceviche and \"tallarines rojos\" [\"red spaghetti,\" with a Peruvian-style red sauce].\r\n\r\nCurrently Wilfredo works transporting passengers, as a taxi driver, that is.  He works about eight hours a day.  In one day he can earn up to 45 PEN, and 65 PEN in a very good day.  Wilfredo works very hard at his job.  He believes that it is going well for him in his business because there are many customers who need transportation and above all because he is very honest and responsible in his work.  He tells us that when he drives he watches out for not only his own safety but also that of his passengers because they both have families, and driving cautiously is the key to avoiding traffic accidents.\r\n\r\nWilfredo is more than grateful to the Kiva lenders because with the money given he will be able to fix the motor of his car and give it general maintenance.  With this improvement he will have a car in good condition so his customers travel more safely and the car is in good shape.  This will generate better income to be able to continue saving and so achieve one of his biggest dreams, to buy a new

","en":"Sangali is married and has two adolescent children.  Since childhood, he dreamed of having his own land and using it as he pleased.  It took a lot of effort for him to obtain a land-use certificate three years ago, and that day was a special day for him and his family.  At first, it was difficult for Sangali to start his business, and he ran into various barriers.  Then everything gradually smoothed out, just like he wanted, but strong competition and low demand for agricultural crops caused him to despair because it was not profitable to sell crops at low prices.

He is constantly taking on challenges in order to get ahead and help his children who still depend on him. Lino is single and dedicates himself to caring for his children and to his work. At present this small, humble family lives in the city of Caman\u00e1, which is located in the south of the country; Caman\u00e1 is known for delicious seafood dishes. As proof of that, Lino considers shrimp chowder the best dish of all, and therefore chose it as his favorite food. \r\n\r\nLino wasn't able to finish high school, but knew that that wasn't going to hold him back. Like the determined youth he was, he began to make excursions into different types of business until the moment when he bought a moto taxi. Since then he has worked twelve hours a day and attends to 50 customers. His performance and dedication show results at the end of the day, as he can earn up to S\/.70 on a good day. This income and his constant effort have allowed Lino to enroll his children in superior schools, so that both can develop themselves professionally. He hopes that they will be very good professionals, honorable and passionate for what they do. \r\n\r\nLino's dream is to be able to buy another moto taxi and to make some repairs to his home, so that his children can continue with their studies. But to do this he needs to buy another moto taxi. Lino's goal is to buy it in six months and generate substantially more income, but in order to be able to buy it he needs to save and work hard. He has had the idea of making some repairs to his moto taxi and this way can secure his 'tool of the trade' and earn the income necessary for his great dream. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":977562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to maintain his moto taxi.

He distributes them in booths where he permanently makes his pre-sales in order to define the amount of pastries he should make. Still, he works part time as a salesman for a company and that helps him get much more customers every day, so his business is thriving. Through his business and the way he works, he has been able to provide for his family which is comprised of his spouse and their three children aged between 4 and 7 years old. His life as an entrepreneur first started when he became unemployed and invested his severance pay in preparing food which he sold by order. This allowed him to gradually add more income-generating activities to his life, and that keeps him active and seeking more and more well-being for his family. His goal is to purchase display cases and shelves in order to better organize his business. Leonardo faces a major challenge because his working capital is not enough to meet the customers' demands. That is the reason why he turns to credikiva, his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With this money he will purchase merchandise such as toys, purses, shoes and clothing. That way he can benefit from the coming season of high sales, when he will get more profits as well as more mobility for his merchandise."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":943296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

year-old young man, who has a higher education degree in construction engineering and works in his field.  He sells painting and decorating materials at the central market.  He has a wide selection of merchandise that is in high demand.  He sells at a leased store by himself and develops his business.  Bakhtiyor started his business by putting together a team of workers, specializing in construction and decoration work, and worked on houses, apartments and offices repair orders.  He earned a living through this work and provided for his family for several years.  Because he had regular clients, who purchased paint and materials, he decided to open an additional business of selling construction materials.  Bakhtiyor combined both businesses since he could sell his merchandise for his own orders to repair apartments and houses, making it more profitable for him.  When he opened his construction materials store, he obtained a small loan from a bank and started his business.  Business was going well, and Bakhtiyor increased his goods turnover.  He worked a lot with lending organizations and never violated procedures.  Prior to the inflation, he obtained financing in international currency, but got burned.  So, since the inflation in December of 2009, he tried to obtain a loan in the national currency and came to us.  According to the client's words, our loan was very timely for him and helped him a lot in improving his family affairs.  Bakhtiyor plans to use this loan to purchase a wholesale inventory of sealants and paint at a low price."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":979047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sealants and paint wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2012-01-11T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-10T20:50:07Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakhtiyor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":179.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":187.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":191.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":195.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":207.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":216.32},{"due_date":"2013-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2013-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2013-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":231.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.9},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.32},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220.84},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":231.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":348.2,"local_amount":348.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":348.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381622},{"amount":179.58,"local_amount":179.58,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":179.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095138},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":183.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:34Z","rounded_local_amount":183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919598},{"amount":187.16,"local_amount":187.16,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":187.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197618},{"amount":191.07,"local_amount":191.07,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":191.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197292},{"amount":195.07,"local_amount":195.07,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":195.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397344},{"amount":1715.59,"local_amount":1715.59,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1715.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452186}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T18:51:23Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":369661,"name":"Imad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imad is a 38-year-old Lebanese single man living with his parents.

He has four children between the ages of 32 and 39.  He came from the Magdalena department to the city of Barranquilla 27 years ago.  He bought a house with his savings, and on that corner he started his own business selling fried food and fast food.  From then on it started to go very well for him.\r\n\r\nHis business is called \u201cEsquina Caliente\u201d (Hot Corner).  It has become more substantial because he has added refreshments and drinks.  With that he has managed to support his household.  It has become the \u201cbackbone of his income\u201d as he maintains it by himself. \r\n\r\nHis goal for later on is to convert it into a strategic point where he sells not only food, but that it becomes a space for family unification and healthy diversion.\r\n\r\nJuan is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the loan to buy cases of beer in order to be well-stocked while awaiting the New Year.  He wants to be stocked with what his customers like for the end of the year festivities, drinks and refreshments.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":943419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He lives in Ak-Bulak, a village in the south of Kyrgyzstan. He has five kids, and his wife is a homemaker. Since 1991, Abdalym\u2019s family has been successfully engaged in growing crops and livestock breeding. Today, the Abdalym\u2019s farm has cows and calves, and enough corn, hay and oil cake for their feed. After cultivating 0.25 hectares of land, Abdalym\u2019s family collected 2.5 tons of potatoes, which they will use during the winter. The income from such business allowed Abdalym to buy a car for his family. \r\n\r\nAbdalym applied for a loan of 100.000 som (KGS) from Bai-Tushum & Partners to purchase more cattle. In the very near future, Abdalym is planning to arrange for his son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":939283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Bulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:50:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-11T21:50:25Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdalym","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975598},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370772},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095383},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070917},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347012559},{"amount":161.25,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":7546.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754536},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631362},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T09:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410013739},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-20T09:44:06Z","rounded_local_amount":12577.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429427152}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T09:03:20Z","paid_date":"2013-12-20T09:44:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Olga Azarian","image":null}},{"id":370103,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 33-year-old married man living with his wife.

Sami wants to purchase new bedroom furniture in order to offer comfortable conditions in his house, so he needs to take a loan from FATEN to pay.  When Sami receives the loan, he will purchase new bedroom furniture.  Sami is photographed in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.
