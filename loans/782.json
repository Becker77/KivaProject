Para poder salir adelante el y su esposa trabajan arduamente todos los d\u00edas, su esposa es una mujer que se dedica a la venta de men\u00fas, cervezas y salchipollos, esta ganancias les permiten recaudar el dinero necesario para los gastos del hogar.\n\nPedro, como todo hombre de familia responsable, se dedica a la venta diaria de Raspadillas  desde las 9 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 5 de la tarde, este duro laborar le permite ganar en promedio S\/.80 diarios y si es un muy buen d\u00eda, que es lo que Pedro desea a diario, \u00e9l puede ganar hasta S\/.180, normalmente atiende entre 60 y 130 clientes. El sabe que su negocio tiene \u00e9xito porque los jarabes que usa para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus raspadillas est\u00e1n a base de pura fruta y atiende muy bien a sus clientes.  Pedro tiene que aprovechar esta temporada tan calurosa en la ciudad de Mala, porque solo es en estos 3 primeros meses del a\u00f1o donde su producto va ser muy solicitado.  Su analista nos coment\u00f3 que el se\u00f1or Pedro fue ubicado en una plaza de Coayllo, ubicada en la ciudad de Mala, y ha debido de esperar para poder realizar la entrevista debido a que tiene mucha afluencia de clientes, incluso hay combis y autos de donde la gente se baja especialmente para comprar su producto y luego retornar al autom\u00f3vil donde se encontraban.\n\nEsta familia est\u00e1 en constante apego y apoyo familiar, es por esto que Pedro tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en dedicarse a la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda, solo cuando tiene contratos de construcci\u00f3n, y es as\u00ed como genera ingresos los meses restantes del a\u00f1o para su familia. Gracias al apoyo de los prestatarios Kiva, \u00e9l podr\u00e1 comprase una moto lineal, la misma que le servir\u00e1 para poder llevar su rica raspadilla a zonas aleda\u00f1as y vender cuando hayan festividades o actividades de otro tipo, su meta es poder generar los ingresos necesarios para educar a sus 3 peque\u00f1os e implementar su negocio con sillas y esas nuevas, pero su sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande es poder ampliar su casa y colocar el restaurant que tiene su esposa en la parte frontal de la misma.\n","en":"Pedro is a 39-year-old man.  He\u2019s married and he and his wife have three little children who are 5, 8 and 12 years old, all attending school although they are currently on vacation.  In order to get ahead, he and his wife work hard every day.  His wife\u2019s a woman who sells daily meals, beer and \u2018salchipollos\u2019 [traditional fast food snack consisting of fried potatoes with fried chicken and condiments].  Profits allow them to earn money needed for household expenses.\r\n\r\nPedro, like all responsible family men, works every day.  He sells \u2018raspadillas\u2019 [shaved ice topped with flavored syrup] from 9 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon.  This hard work enables him to earn on average 80 soles a day and if he has a very good day, which is what Pedro wishes for every day, he can earn up to 180 soles.  He normally tends to between 60 and 130 customers.  He knows that his business is successful because the syrups he uses to make the shaved ice are based on pure fruit and because he provides very good customer service.  Pedro must take advantage of the hot season in the city of Mala because during the first three months of the year his product is highly sought-after.  His loan adviser commented to us that Pedro was situated in one of Coayllo\u2019s squares located in the city of Mala and his interview had to be postponed because of the large affluence of customers he has.  Besides, there are buses and autos that the people get off of precisely to buy his product and then climb in again.\r\n\r\nThis family constantly support and love each other and this is why Pedro has also gone into bricklaying but only when he gets construction contracts.  This is how he generates additional income for the family during the other months of the year.\r\n\r\nThanks to support from Kiva lenders he will be able to buy a linear motorcycle that he can use to transport his shave ice maker from place to place and go to nearby zones to sell when they have their festivals or other types of activities.  His goal is to generate the necessary income to educate his three little ones and to supply his business with new tables and chairs.  But his greatest dream is to be able to enlarge his house and install his wife\u2019s restaurant in the front part of it.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":978550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

He lives in Ica, Peru.  Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, almost four hours south of Lima, the country's capital, and it is renowned by Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\"  It is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (one 8.0 in 2007 and one 6.9 in 2011), its grape, asparagus, and olive production, and perhaps above all as the source of Peru's traditional national drink, pisco.  This customer's home and business can be found in this hot, dry climate. It is common knowledge that Peru has some of the most delicious food in the world and one of his favorite dishes is arroz chaufa.  Gustavo only went to school up until the fifth grade because of his parents' limited financial resources, but he would have liked to have studied civic engineering.\r\n\r\nGustavo lives with his partner, who sells salchipapas.  They have two children together, the eldest of whom is in the fifth grade, with the youngest in the first grade.\r\n\t\r\nGustavo molds and fires bricks for a living.  He does this work five hours a day and he is able to serve one customer per day.  Because this work is very hard and demanding, he is able to earn 60 nuevos soles a day and on a good day he can earn up to 80, which helps him with extra household expenses and which allows him to invest in his business.  He believes that his business is going well because there is always a clientele for this kind of work.  He also works helping his partner sell mototaxis and this is going well for them because of the way his partner seasons her dishes.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, he is very thankful to Kiva's borrowers because with this help he will be able to help his partner do some maintenance work on her sandwich cart and with this improvement she will have more supplies with which to make her salchipapas and hamburgers.  This will also increase her earnings, which will improve their quality of life and allow them to continue to save, which will help them achieve their greatest dream: offering their children a profession.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":978653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

children.  His wife is not employed and takes care of the household.  Rahim comes to his place of work every morning at the largest city market, Panshanbe, in the city center.  Here, he is involved in selling fruits and vegetables.  His selection includes bananas, apples, pears and tropical fruits, and out of vegetables - tomatoes and cucumbers.  Local farmers and dekhan farmers, who deliver fruits and vegetables to him, supply him with the products in the spring.  He travels to the neighboring Uzbekistan himself in the winter, and also buys products from local farmers, who grow fruits and vegetables in greenhouses.  Rahim's oldest son (shown on the photograph) helps him with running the business and also when Rahim leaves to buy products.  Besides this, his son is an auto-mechanic and is involved in car repairs.  Rahim has been working with our organization since 2002 and has shown himself as an exemplary and punctual client throughout this time.  He wants to use the loan in the sum of 12000 somoni to buy a car, which he plans to use for the family and for the business.  Rahim is grateful to Arvand for supporting his business and hopes to have a lasting

He lives in this town together with his wife and three children who are between 7 and 12 years old.  Rafael's business idea was born when he lost his job in a factory.  He invested his severance pay in buying drinks and this business has enabled him to provide for his family.

the west of Ukraine. Stepan produces and distributes advertising. His office is conveniently located in the city centre. He's been in this business for four years. Even after new competition appeared two years ago, Stepan's professionalism has allowed him to maintain his brand to this day. Stepan's current monthly income is slightly above 5000 hryvnia. With the help of this loan from Kiva, he hopes to purchase a large-format printer and to install windows in his office. The printer will expand the range of services that Stepan's company offers. The new windows will improve the insulation of the workspace, plus Stepan will be able to use them for additional advertisement.\r\n\r\nStepan was educated in Hungary.

lives in Iraq with his wife and four children. For the last 17 years, he has earned a living by running a store where he sells the most basic products every Iraqi household uses: rice, cereals, and the most basic grains and spices.

He provides public transportation services using his mototaxi (a light, 3-wheeled passenger vehicle) in the city of Ica.  Ica is located in the Sechura desert, about four hours to the south of Lima, the nation's capital.  Ica is acclaimed by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (the land of the sun).  This area is known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus and olives, and perhaps most of all, as the source of Pisco, the traditional national drink of Peru.  In this warm and dry climate we find the house and business of Jose.\r\n\r\nJose started his business by renting a mototaxi and working an average of 12 hours a day.  This allows him to have an income between 70-90 Peruvian soles a day, which helps him a lot to cover all of the expenses that he has to take on, such as the gas, the rent for the mototaxi, and other personal expenses.  \r\n\r\nWith the help of Kiva lenders, he will be able to do maintenance work on his vehicle, since over time some parts have been wearing out and he needs to change them as soon as possible.  This assistance will allow him to continue to improve his income, and with it he will be able to save, because in 6 months he plans to buy his own mototaxi.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":951574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to do maintenance work on his mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Parcona","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-19T23:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-17T23:40:09Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Junior","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101.27},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":112.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":121.36},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":126.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":130.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":140.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":145.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":150.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.83},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.82,"local_amount":101.27,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":104.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142522},{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":104.95,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:57Z","rounded_local_amount":108.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271108},{"amount":438.13,"local_amount":1142.95,"processed_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1181.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322953812},{"amount":57.82,"local_amount":150.83,"processed_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":155.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088249}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T16:54:21Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:21:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":372452,"name":"Daler","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 25 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u2013 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b.

Nidia has always wanted her son to have the best possible education but her low income has not allowed her to offer this.\r\n\r\nNidia faces a large inconvenience because her store does not have a tent over it to protect it from the rain so that every time it starts to rain she has to close the store so that it won\u2019t fill up with water.  Hoping that this situation can change, Nidia is seeking a loan that will allow her to buy a tent to cover the store and protect it from the rain so that she doesn\u2019t have to close every time it rains.  Nidia states that this way her income will increase considerably because she\u2019ll have the store open more hours per day and thanks to its good location people will relate to it and lead to its

Javier Mauricio espera que as\u00ed sus ingresos se incrementen y pueda cumplir el sue\u00f1o de que sus padres y el tengan una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"\r\nJavier Mauricio has received the business that\u2019s his family tradition: merchandise transportation and moving services.  The truck has belonged to his uncles and his father for several years.  Javier Mauricio has worked since he was a little boy; he learned how to drive when he was 10 years old because he always helped his father load the truck and when he turned 18 he received the business and started driving the truck and responding to the business.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 36 Javier Mauricio continues working in the same activity an thanks to it has been able to move his parents ahead since they are now of an age when work is difficult for them.  Javier Mauricio dreams with his parents having a better quality of life and this is why he wants to increase his income.  However, the truck is starting to have some mechanical difficulties in the engine and this has led him to decline some customer contracts.  Javier Mauricio hopes then that a loan will allow him to repair the engine and to service other parts of the truck so that he can work more efficiently and be able to secure more customer contracts.  Javier Mauricio hopes his income will increase so that he can reach his dream of providing his parents a better quality of

Despite her age, she took a course six years ago to learn how to make detergent. Since then, she has dedicated herself to this activity and with the business income, Fabiola is able to cover household expenses for the home she shares with her husband. Fabiola is 51 years old. Her parents did not have stable income when she was young and the family struggled with many difficult financial situations. That's why Fabiola is so motivated now to create financial stability for her family. \r\n\r\nShe has many loyal customers who consistently order from her, but unfortunately her customers often pay on credit and Fabiola struggles to maintain enough working capital to keep her business running. For this reason, Fabiola is requesting a working capital loan to finance her production. She would also like to buy a case to display her products from her home.

In an effort to support his parents, he wants to stock a store that he leased a few days ago. This is why he is searching for a loan that will allow him to buy merchandise such as vegetables, oils, grains, detergent, soft drinks, and liquor.

With his store as his source of income, Gabriel has seen how the business has been able to create greater financial stability for him, and better opportunities to progress for him and his family.

He learned the trade by helping his grandfather.  It is from his grandfather that he inherited this trade and under his grandfather that he learned the business.  Through his meat business, Alvaro has managed to provide for his family which consists of his wife and his five children who are between 4 and 26 years old.  When he got married and took on the responsibilities of a head of household, Alvaro turned to his knowledge of the trade and set up his own business in his in-laws' house.  More than 10 years ago, he acquired business premises in the main square in Arjona, on a plot of land belonging to his sister.  His business has done very well there.  He still has the same sales location and he distributes his produce to stores.  However, when his customer numbers increase, his working capital is not sufficient.  In particular, during holiday periods he needs to have his business stocked with larger quantities of produce.  For this reason, he is requesting a Kiva loan, which is the first loan he has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use his loan to buy beef in larger quantities and deliver larger quantities to the stores where he has already pre-sold it.  Alvaro's dream is to increase his income and provide his children with a better education.  Whilst this is happening, his investment profitability is 82.27% and it is from this point that he is planning his future, strengthening his business through his loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":984235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

His family is the reason that he works diligently every day in his store. Benito set his store up some time ago as there were no such shop in his neighbourhood that could cover all the needs of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. So Benito was a pioneer in his area and thanks to this he acquired a large clientele. Benito has always wanted his wife and three children to have everything they need and he is always looking for ways to improve their quality of life. Benito's biggest dream is to buy the property where he has his store and set up a much better business there, where he can make improvements. This is the reason why he is looking to increase his income.\r\n\r\nHis store has a wide range of all types of stock, but he feels he lacks a cabinet where he can put products which require refrigeration. As he cannot store this products, at the moment Benito has had to stop selling this type of product. Hoping to improve his situation, Benito is looking to buy a refrigerated cabinet, but he does not have the necessary money available. For this reason Benito is hoping that a loan will allow him to buy this refrigerated cabinet to store more products which require refrigeration, therefore offering more products to his customers. Benito states that this cabinet will increase his sales considerably, as his customers are always suggesting he sell more refrigerated products. Benito hopes to be able to increase his income, fulfil his dream of buying the property where his store is and improving the quality of life of his wife and three children, offering them the best possible education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":984386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

However, because during this season Ana Sol is paying her children\u2019s school fees and also paying for merchandise she\u2019s purchased from her suppliers, she does not have sufficient capital to buy her display cases so is hoping for a loan that will allow her to have access to these display cases and that allows her to continue selling more each time thus reaching her dream of her children having the best possible wellbeing in their lives.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":985149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a display case.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-19T17:50:05Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Sol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56946},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58552},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60204},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61902},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63648},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65444},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67290},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69188},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71140},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73146},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75210},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.01},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.3},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.03,"local_amount":56946,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":58823.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362180},{"amount":32.94,"local_amount":58552,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":60482.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075477},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":60134,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":62116.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902220},{"amount":34.7,"local_amount":61694,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":63728.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326592},{"amount":35.79,"local_amount":63625,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":65723.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287431979},{"amount":37.16,"local_amount":66065,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":68243.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378029},{"amount":37.64,"local_amount":66970,"processed_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":69178.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432650},{"amount":0.93,"local_amount":1654,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1708.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617151},{"amount":204.95,"local_amount":364360,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":376374.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640102}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T14:46:36Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":374083,"name":"Mbaye Gueye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur Mbaye est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 57 ans.

Thanks to this quality, he has been able to get ahead in life and provide for his wife's well-being.  Humberto used to work as a cleaner in a restaurant.  However, owing to the bad treatment that he received from his bosses and the fact that they didn't value him, he decided to start working for himself and make income on a different path.  Humberto started selling coffee from a small cart.  He gradually increased the products that he sells to his customers.  Humberto is well-known to his customers because his products are very good quality and he always provides them with the very best customer service.  Humberto says that he would like his business to grow and would like to set up a cafe in the future so that he can provide work for many people and save them from having to work for bad bosses.  In addition, Humberto also dreams of his business providing him with good income so that he can acquire his own home and provide his wife with more comforts and a better quality of life.  Whilst waiting for his sales to increase, Humberto would like to make some improvements to the little cart from which he sells his coffee and other products because, right now, it is very uncomfortable to transport and this stops him from making sales in different places.  Humberto is requesting a loan which will allow him to make improvements to his sales cart and which will also enable him to buy more products to offer his customers.  In this way, his sales will increase significantly as he will manage to get to more places and have a better selection of products to offer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":985177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to make improvements to the cart from which he sells his coffee and to buy more products so that he can offer a wider variety","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-19T18:50:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Humberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1020000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":44271},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45520},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46804},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48125},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49482},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50878},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52313},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":53789},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55306},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":56866},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58470},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60120},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61816},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63559},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65352},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67196},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69091},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71042}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.83},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.84},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":24.96,"local_amount":44271,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":45830.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362181},{"amount":26.16,"local_amount":46397,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":48031.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075478},{"amount":26.6,"local_amount":47179,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":48840.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902221},{"amount":27.01,"local_amount":47919,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":49606.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326593},{"amount":27.62,"local_amount":48999,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50725.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287431980},{"amount":442.65,"local_amount":785235,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":812895.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378030}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T05:44:58Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":382082,"name":"William Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"William se ha dedicado gran parte de su vida a buscar generar sus propios ingresos.

He graduated from the Yerevan Polytechnic Institute, where he obtained a speciality of engineer-radio technician.  Varuzhan is married and has two children -  a son and a daughter.  His son attends a paid division of the Yerevan Medical University, and daughter goes to a secondary school.  Varuzhan spent many years working as a rescuer at the Ministry of Emergency Situations.  Since 2011, he has been involved in a private entrepreneurship at a leased space, where he sells accessories (purses, school briefcases, belts, umbrellas, watches, glasses, etc.).  Varuzhan buys merchandise for his store once per month at wholesale markets in Yerevan.  He has many regular customers, who prefer to make their purchases specifically at his store, due to the quality of merchandise and Varuzhan's kindness.  He works without days off and is able to support his family, and pay for his son's university education, thanks to the earnings from this business.  Varuzhan needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 Armenia dram for the purchase of a large inventory of merchandise, such as purses, watches and belts, in anticipation of the New Year and Christmas holidays.  These types of merchandise sell especially well as presents at the current time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":955576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

However, because of the winter season lived these past three months, Giovanny does not have sufficient capital to do these improvements so is hoping that a loan will allow him to do the improvements and to buy more products to increase what he has available for his customers.

He is married to a businesswoman and has one child aged 17 years. In 2006, Anthony established his drinks, milk, ovaltine, liquor, sugar, butter, baby cream, and soap business. He began his business because his parents were business people and he grew up in the business even though he was going to school. But he paid more attention to the business and after he left school, he decided to continue with it. Working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, he earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Anthony requires a loan in order to purchase phones - 20 pieces @ Le200,000, savanna* drinks - 5 crates @ le120,000 and maltina** drinks - 4 crates @ Le100,000.  He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 750,000. In the future, Anthony plans to become an international businessman.  The business is good as it helps in adding to his capital. He hope to educate his child as he will make more profit out of it.  He usually experiences challenges due to the change in the exchange rate.  He doesn\u2019t have competition as his shop is the only cosmetic and provision shop in the area. He serves students from the nearby college and people around town.  He serves about 40 people a day.  He treats his customers well.  He is assisted by his wife, and usually buys his goods from Conakry, Guinea twice every month by public transport.  Anthony saves some of his profit and the rest he uses to buy more stock.  He is planning to expand his business by accessing more loans.

She will use her loan to purchase jewelry such as bracelets, rings, earrings, and some pairs of shoes for women and men. \r\n\r\nDamaris is a mother of three children and they still live together with their father (her long-term partner). Her most important challenge is to ensure that her children have a good future. She will make it possible by working hard. Damaris is receiving her fifth loan from Esperanza Internacional and, because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to grow her business with the re-investment she makes from each loan. She started her business three years ago and at that time only sold clothes. By taking loans, she started to introduce different products. She would like to save her profits so that she can pay for her children's university education and be able to provide them with a safe home as she also has plans to improve her house.\r\n\r\nIn this loan, we are adding three pictures.

He is married to a trader and has two school-going children, ages 10 and 7 years. In 2004, Alieu established his provisions, toiletries and top cards (mobile) business. He did not go to school as his father does not respect education. His father was a cattle rearer and, when he grew up, he decided to join him in the same trade. During the war in Sierra Leone \u2013 specifically in his home town, Kabala \u2013 he lost all his cattle which forced him to come and settle in Makeni town, where he started as a peddler. Over some years, he raised a huge sum of money and opened a shop. Till now, his business has improved gradually.\r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, Alieu earns about 1,892,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. He is assisted by family members. Alieu has already received and successfully repaid one loan. He would like a new loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. He requires this loan in order to purchase cigarettes (Bond - 1 carton for 1,000,000 SLL and Gold Seal for 600,000 SLL), top-up cards (30,000 units for 38,000 SLL), sugar (2 bags for 260,000 SLL) and toothpaste (1 carton for 140,000 SLL). He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately 473,000 SLL.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Alieu plans to open a bigger outlet to display his goods. He is nervous about the future prospects of his business because he wants to open a bigger shop so that he can be selling wholesale. The rise and fall in foreign currency can cause high prices in the cost of goods, and while meeting customers\u2019 needs, sometimes it affects his sales and reduces his profit. Competition is not high because he is the only retailer in the area dealing with these products. \r\n\r\nAlieu serves about 50 people per day. He serves people from around the city \u2013 at least 20 people per day. He also serves people from the surroundings and people from nearby villages. His business is popular because he treats his customers fairly and respects their views. He buys his goods in Conakry twice per month and in Freetown once every week by vehicle. He uses his profit to buy more stock for his business. He is a hardworking and very committed businessman. He hopes to repay his loan on time in order to access subsequent loans. He thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":988233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase cigarettes (Bond and Gold Seal), top-up cards, sugar and toothpaste.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-20T21:10:06Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alieu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505741},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974846},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815410},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444464},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537177},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284646},{"amount":92.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":404687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338213},{"amount":277.5,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1214062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354616}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T15:32:25Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":374381,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is a 28 year-old single man and owner of a big transportation truck since 2010.

He has lived with his partner for three years and they have a two-year-old son.  His partner supports him a lot in all that he does and he tells us that she's his right hand and she's the only one who listens to him when he's feeling bad or worried about problems that everyone faces.  They live together in Pedro's mother's house where she has generously offered them a room.\r\n\r\nPedro works \"from sun to sun\" as they say in Peru.  He has worked in transportation on his mototaxi for two years.  He gets up very early in the morning and sometimes he gets extra work doing things like helping in the fields when there's a harvest, doing construction work, or sometimes selling chickens.  He's a person with a thousand trades because if you find honest work, why not do it?  He works around 10 hours a day without stopping.  He thinks his business is going well because God is on his side and He is the only one who guides him down the right path and also because his son is the best motivation he could have to get ahead.\r\n\r\nPedro is very thankful to Kiva's lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to perform maintenance on his mototaxi and start a new business raising chickens.  This new business will allow him to earn more so he can improve his quality of life and give his son the best.

He is 51 years old and the father of nine children, six of whom are now independent, while the remaining three are still minors.  Unfortunately, he is separated from his wife and his three children, 15-year-old Elizabeth, 12-year-old Carmen, and 7-year-old Walter.  However, he keeps in touch with his children and makes sure they are fed and educated.  Francisco has a very dynamic job, as he has to be constantly moving from one place to another.  He goes to different places close to the district he lives in, approaching small farms, large farms, and country houses looking for animals to buy.  Once he has the animals, he goes downtown to sell them.  He has been doing this work for 14 years now and so far it has allowed him to offer his family all the best.  He likes his work a lot because it allows him to spend his time as it best suits him and because it lets him travel to many different places.  At the moment he has a good market that he can go to straight to without having to go all over wasting time.  His customers give him good prices and he takes home a good percentage of his sales, which results in good earnings for him.  Now he wants to keep working a lot to make his business grow.

Carlos Humberto is always seeking methods to be able to generate more income for his home.  He assures us that most important are his wife and son of 6 years, to whom he wants to offer everything that he needs to do well.  Approximately 4 and a half years ago, Carlos Humberto decided to set aside the activity of selling boxes in the food market of his region to open his own vegetable and fruit stand, as he saw that this activity would generate more income for his home.  Since then he has performed this activity and, thanks to his good service and the quality of the products that he offers his clients, he has been recognized in the sector and already has become  preferred by people at the moment they make their purchases.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the disadvantage that Carlos Humberto has with respect to the other people that sell vegetables and fruits in the same sector, is that Carlos Humberto does not have his own sales position, which means he must perform his sales on the outskirts of the other sales businesses.  For Carlos Humberto it has been very difficult to have to overcome said situation, and he declares that if he had his own sales location, his income would be a lot better than currently.  Carlos Humberto wants to save to be able to buy or lease a location in the future, for which he estimates that first he should begin to enlarge his sales.  It is for this reason that Carlos Humberto intends to buy a greater assortment of fruits and vegetables and to be able to make his business more attractive to the clients, offering a greater variety of products.  However Carlos Humberto does not have sufficient capital to make this purchase and hopes for a loan to permit him to purchase the fruits and vegetables that will enlarge the variety of products that he offers his clients.  \r\n\r\nCarlos Humberto expects that with a greater variety of products, his sales be increased considerably, and in this manner he will be able to move to a location which will be more attractive to his clients.  And as soon as he is in the location, he estimates that his sales will be much greater, and he will be able thus to fulfill his dream to offer a better quality of life to his wife, and to be able to offer his son the best possible education and a stable economic future.
