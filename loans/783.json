Since he was very young, he has always wanted to be independent and to be able to help his parents with the household costs so that they could improve their quality of life, and so that he could offer them a better future.  His parents have always been very hardworking people, and they made a great effort to help Gustavo get ahead.  Now Gustavo wants to return the favor to them, and offer them a better life than they currently have.  Gustavo began his stationary store business a while ago.  Thanks to the very good quality of the products that Gustavo sells and to Gustavo's great service, his customers already have his business in mind when it is time to buy their products.\r\nGustavo has a big dream.  It is to be able to offer his parents the opportunity to rest, so that they no longer have to work since they have worked very hard throughout their lives.  But Gustavo knows that to be able to fulfill his dream, it is necessary that his stationary business generate greater income than it is making currently.  This is why Gustavo is looking for the possibility to increase the variety of products that he offers to his customers in the stationary store.  However, he does not have sufficient funds to do this.  This is why Gustavo is hoping that a loan will allow him to purchase the merchandise for his stationary store like notebooks, pens, erasers, scissors, among other products that will allow him to make his business more attractive to all the people in his area.\r\nGustavo hopes that with the increase in the variety of products that he offers to his customers, that his sales will significantly increase.  He hopes that that he will therefore be able to fulfill his dream of being able to offer his parents stable finances and a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":986283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper

In his free time he enjoys taking walks and traveling.  As everyone knows, Per\u00fa is known for its delicious food and one of the dishes that he especially likes is \"Carapulcra con sopa seca\" (spicy Incan period cuisine).  Luis Pablo received a technical education but would like to have studied law.  He lives with his common-law wife who collects recyclable materials.  They have two children who are in high school.\r\n\r\nLuis is a taxi driver who works approximately 12 hours a day in the city of Ica.  He decided to go into this business because of the need for transporation in his community.  He averages 20 customers per day which provides an average income of 90 PEN a day.  On a good day he can earn as much as 120 PEN a day, which helps cover additional household expenses.  He believes the business is successful because he is responsible and honest and is also kind to the passengers.\r\n\r\nHe hopes Kiva lenders can help him provide maintenance for his vehicle, which is his main work tool.  He wants to pay back the loan over a 12-month period.  This support will mean he can keep his vehicle in good running condition and provide safety for customers.  He wants to buy another car in a few months so he can realize his dream: \"to have three cars to increase income for the household\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":956035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To provide maintenance for his taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-23T10:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-21T10:40:05Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":205.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":209.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":223.55},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":225.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":236.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":242.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":253.31},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":260.6},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":270.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":281.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":290.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":301.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.88},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":155.78,"local_amount":415.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":419.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271115},{"amount":83.83,"local_amount":223.55,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":225.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993768},{"amount":84.57,"local_amount":225.54,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":227.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601673},{"amount":88.64,"local_amount":236.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":238.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090803},{"amount":712.18,"local_amount":1899.16,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1918.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287221892}],"funded_date":"2012-02-05T12:52:46Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":383665,"name":"John Y.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is from Makeni city, in northern Sierra Leone.

","en":"Suerkul is 60 years old. The main source of income for his family is animal husbandry. Thanks to Suerkul's persistence and perseverance, the farm, which was started with a sum of 25,000 som (KGS), currently brings in around 15,000 som (KGS) per month from the sale of meat and dairy products. \r\n\r\nIn order to further increase the number of cattle, Suerkul turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of dairy cows. Suerkul plans to invest the income in further increasing the number of domestic animals.

Little by little this business has grown and she has diversified the products she offers to her customers.\r\n\r\nMiriam affirms that she is aspiring to have a very big business in which everyone has her as a reference, and this business will generate a large income for her.  For the time being the business has unstable sales, so Miriam has to alternate selling disposable containers with selling ice cream.  The big advantage is that Miriam does this job from home and can be on top on taking care of her family.\r\n\r\nWith the intention of facing a season in which Miriam says her sales go up considerably, Miriam needs to supply her business and buy more merchandise of disposable products.  However, currently she does not have sufficient capital to do it.  This is why Miriam is striving for a loan, to give her the possibility of managing to buy the disposable containers so she can be prepared for the season in which her sales go up

Los empresarios  surten sus negocios,  para responderle a sus clientes, con bebidas, comidas, artesan\u00edas, disfraces, carrosas y verbenas, en torno a la popularidad que emana de los ciudadanos de la ciudad y de turistas locales e internacionales; como un solo bloque estas fiestas del caribe colombiano llenas de color  y de acci\u00f3n logran que la gente  se aliste para deleitarse y desinhibirse  disfraz\u00e1ndose,  comprando y bailando. Esto es justamente lo que aprovechan los emprendedores como Arlett, que con su negocio de  venta de refrescos y bebidas fr\u00edas, planea tener un buen surtido para que sus utilidades en esta temporada se incrementen, aprovechando el derroche de alegr\u00eda de sus clientes. Su negocio naci\u00f3 justamente del carnaval de Barranquilla, cuando en el a\u00f1o 1989, vend\u00eda todos los productos de la empresa Bavaria,  en todos los eventos del Carnaval dela ciudad y en las fiestas de los municipios de los departamentos, para ello no necesitaba de capital de trabajo, pues los productos se los entregaban mediante el sistema de consignaci\u00f3n, es decir los que no vend\u00eda pod\u00eda devolverlos. Aqu\u00ed aprendi\u00f3 a trabajar independientemente y poco a poco con su trabajo y sus ahorros,  logr\u00f3 comprar cervezas, gaseosas y poni maltas por cajas,  que vend\u00eda al detal; gradualmente con el incremento de su capital de trabajo,  logr\u00f3 comprar en mayor cantidad y as\u00ed mismo vender al  mayor. En la actualidad nuevamente se prepara para responder a esas  festividades   y debe estar muy bien dotada de todo lo que la alegr\u00eda de sus clientes le exige.

","en":"Soon they will celebrate Carnival in Barranquilla, and all the people in the city are preparing to enjoy themselves, each in his or her own way. The merchants are stocking their businesses, so that they can respond to their customers' requests with beverages, foods, handicrafts, costumes, parade floats and fairs, because of the popularity of the festival with the citizens of the city and the local and international tourists. As a single block, these festivals of the Colombian Caribbean, full of color and action, enlist the people to enjoy themselves and lose their inhibitions, wearing costumes, buying, and dancing. \r\n\r\nThis, as it happens, is what the business people like Arlett take advantage of, with her business of soft drinks and cold beverages. She plans to have a good stock so that her profits increase during this season, taking advantage of the extravagance of happiness of her customers. As it happens, her business was born out of the Barranquilla Carnival, when, in the year 1989, she was selling all the products of the Bavaria company at all the Carnival events in the city and in the township festivals in the districts. To do this, she didn't need any working capital, since they gave her the products on the consignment system, that is, she could return what she didn't sell. There she leaned to work independently, and little by little, with her work and her savings, she managed to buy beer, soft drinks, and Pony Malt (a non-alcoholic malt beverage) by the case, which she sold retail. Gradually, with the increase in her working capital, she managed to buy in larger quantities and also to sell wholesale. Now she is preparing again to respond to these festivities and she should be very well stocked with everything that the happiness of her customers requires of her. This is the reason she has turned to her Kiva loan, the first financing she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy beer in large volume, to sell at the various festivities and from her own home, infecting those who know her with much

\n","en":"Irina was born in 1969 in a simple family of a bus driver. Her mother worked as a construction site foreperson. After graduating from college in 1988, Irina found a job as a weaver at the Karabaltinsky carpet factory. In 1991 she met her husband and in 1992 gave birth to her daughter. After ten years of marriage, Irina again became single. In 2002, while looking for a source of income for her small family, Irina began selling men's and women's clothing at the market in the village of Kaindy, using 6000 som (KGS) as her starting capital. Since the trade was not very profitable, Irina sold off her inventory and from 2006 to 2007 worked as a saleswoman in retail.\r\n\r\nAs her next step, Irina decided to lease a nearby shop that sells detergents, soaps, and cosmetics. Thanks to her tenacity, persistence, and daily work, Irina was able to develop her business, using the profits to buy an apartment in the village. In order to expand the range of her products, Irina has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS). Irina plans to use the profits from this loan to finance her daughter's college education.

He says, \"I always wanted to do something that makes people happy and people are always happy when they go on vacation.\"  \r\n\r\nTim is a \"destination specialist.\" He arranges tours to Africa, China and the Holy Land. He also specializes in cruises. Tim has been on almost all of the major cruise lines and considers himself an expert on the demographics of the clientele on each of the lines. He's traveled to Bermuda, the Bahamas and Alaska.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked how he can compete with the online travel services, Tim says that he beats their prices because the online companies charge an additional fee that Tim does not charge.  \r\n\r\nHe heard about Kiva on the radio in New Orleans. Coincidentally, he plans to use his loan proceeds to advertise his business on the radio and also to buy ads on the street cars in New Orleans.

","en":"Natalya is 51 years old.  She works as an economic development specialist at the local administration office.  In 1996, in search of an additional source of income for her family, Natalya started her animal husbandry business with an initial sum of 6,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her diligence and persistence, today her business with six cows, one calf, fifteen sheep and one horse yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and meat products.

She's been doing this work ever since she stopped working as an employee of a company.  She took her severance pay, and gradually invested it in fabric to make decorative items for babies.  She makes crib canopies, crib bedding and baby accessories by hand, which are commissioned by her friends.  This has allowed her to gradually make profits, so that she could buy a sewing machine and give herself the task of acquiring customers who will buy the products that she makes and designs, either on a cash or credit basis.  Luz, in her quest for growth, has approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo organization to request a Kiva loan to increase her working capital, as she needs to make cash wholesale purchases of raw materials and supplies to make crib canopies, bed sheets, pillows and small pillow-cases that she has orders for.  With this investment, she will be able to reduce her costs, because she will get a discounted price if she can buy in cash and in a bigger volume than usual.

This form of work allows her to generate resources to help her family, since she is married and has six children.\n\nCristina is not in the photo because she had to go away for family reasons.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":986561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy vicuna ponchos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T18:50:06Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelia Angelica\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Teodocia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12121.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2020.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2020.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2020.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":295.84,"local_amount":2020.22,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418163},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":2020.22,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133042},{"amount":295.84,"local_amount":2020.22,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749854},{"amount":591.67,"local_amount":4040.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4058.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243338},{"amount":295.82,"local_amount":2020.1,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516209}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T22:54:57Z","paid_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":383589,"name":"Celia Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celia Maria tiene 35 a\u00f1os de estado civil Union Libre vive el compa\u00f1ero y con los hijos.

The family live in their own house in the town of Zona Patria in the Chanchamayo province. Goyo is a man of the fields. His principal economic activity is agriculture. Since he was a child he has dedicated his life to this tiring work and he now has his own plots of land to cultivate, where he grows 'Isla' bananas. Each week he harvests 40 crates which he sells for eight to ten soles each. Goyo is happy with his results. His method of working allows him to save money as his customers come to him to carry the bananas away on trucks. With his tireless labour he has educated his children and provided them with decent living conditions. Although he doesn't wish to complain, one of his main problems throughout his life as a farmer has been diseases like 'Cock's eye' and lice, which impregnate the leaves and grain, inhibiting their growth and ripening.\r\n\r\nGoyo is intelligent and he knows how to tackle these plagues, which is why he is well paid for his produce. Thanks to this, he has been able to obtain his seventh loan from MFP. He promises to repay his monthly instalments in a timely manner. He also mentions feeling at home among the members of his communal bank, as they share the same interests in development. With the loan money he will be able to buy bags of fertiliser to cultivate his coffee and bananas, and to pay the workers who look after cleaning the leaves from the ground.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":988468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic fertiliser and hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T20:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T20:00:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Goyo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446453}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T12:42:43Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Brown","image":560642}},{"id":384563,"name":"Edward","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edward is 32 years old, single and resides in Narok, Kenya.

The oldest has a family of his own.  Marcelino lives with his wife, children and daughter-in-law in a house that he owns in Zona Patria, a rual town in Chanchamayo province.  Marcelino is a happy, optimistic man, qualities that he applies to his work.  He learned farming as a boy and it's now his main source of income and his means of supporting his family.  He owns 6 hectares [about 15 acres] of land, 4 of which he's set aside for growing coffe and platanos.  His last harvest yielded 32 sacks of [dropped word--probably coffee] which he sold at a good price.  Each platanos crop yields 40 to 50 \"arrobas\" [a unit of weight equal to somewhere between 11 and 16 pounds, depending on the region] of platanos which he can sell locally for 4 soles per arroba.  He says that he couuld make more for his crop in the city, but he sells at a local market because the extra amount that he can make in the city isn't enough to cover the related transportation expenses.

Working this way she has been able to buy appliances and other things to make her life easier, but her priority is to educate her children, so she will continue working as she has done until now.

Early every morning, he and his wife get up and begin the process of grinding corn to prepare their delicious rolls, filled with cheese and with corn. They also supervise and work with one employee in the food stall, where they sell arepas (a filled cornbread) of eggs, sweets, or cheee, carima\u00f1olas (a stuffed fritter made from yucca), coffee with milk, and cold soft drinks, so that their customers, however early they pass through the door of their business, are attracted by the cases full of fresh products for consumption that they sell there for breakfast. Eduardo and his wife began their business 10 years ago, offering small quantities of fried food and coffee to the community in general, in a little sales area in their house. Joining their efforts and their work discipline, their business grew and their capital increased until they were able to offer complete breakfasts, and then they reached the point where they could sell beverages and natural fruits juices from their region in a room that was adequate to tend to their customers. Their dream is to expand and make their business independent until they are able to have a big restaurant, but the business needs to grow in market, and their working capital is insufficient to do it alone. This is the reason why they have turned to a Kiva loan, the first financing that they have had at Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which they will buy corn, coffee, oil, powdered milk, cheese, meats, and eggs in larger proportion, so that they can start increasing the products they offer and begin to negotiate with shops around their neighborhood. The investment that Eduardo is planning will be successful, because of his experience as a micro-entrepreneur and because he has managed to have a pre-sale, which will increase the volume of clients who buy in greater quantities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":988497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, coffee, oil, powdered milk, cheese, meats, and eggs in larger volume","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-23T22:30:05Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo Emilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":53328},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79539},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":81395},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83294},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":85237},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87226},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":89261},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91344},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":93476},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95657},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97889},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":132354}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.7},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.91},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.89},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.9,"local_amount":53328,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":54544.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039183},{"amount":570.1,"local_amount":1016672,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1039855.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651315}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T15:26:51Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":383193,"name":"Mercedes Obdulia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela Los Bosques  de la ciudad de Portoviejo, ciudad hermosa de verdes  monta\u00f1as y paisajes  encantadores, conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os como la Ciudad Del Valle lugar donde se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas las socias del Banco Comunal Emprendedora de los Bosques.\n\nEn este lugar conocimos a la  se\u00f1ora Mercedes.

She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy raw materials for her business.  In the future, Padma Laxmi plans to improve the economic conditions of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\n\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts.  Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand-tool finishing.
