He parents were simple workers.   After she finished school, Elmira helped her family around the house.  At the time she could only dream about further education as the money her parents earned was enough only for food.  The family's main source of income was growing beets, and from her childhood Elmira has a great deal of experience in working with domesticated animals and in growing field crops. \r\n\r\nAfter she married, Elmira and her husband made their home in a tiny shack on the edge of their village and grew beets on 1\/10 ha (about 1\/4 acre) of land.  Their young family made it through many troubles and, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, endured difficult years.  There was no work in the village and at that time Elmira and her husband were raising five children and had two dairy cows.   Besides their own children, Elmira and her husband helped their parents' families where they had younger brothers and sisters.  \r\n\r\nThanks to Elmira's perseverance and persistence, today she has two dairy cows and two young bulls.  The sale of milk allows her to earn about 3,000 som (KGS) per month.  With the goal of further developing her business, Elmira turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy additional cattle.  She plans to invest the income in further increasing her herd and to make her dream of building a small farm come true. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":991353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Panfilovskoe village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T05:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T05:40:02Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2013-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":752.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.5},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":752.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":15068.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285472},{"amount":752.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35159.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459390},{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15068.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495259},{"amount":752.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:00Z","rounded_local_amount":35159.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552754}],"funded_date":"2012-01-25T21:10:14Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":383661,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mujeres Unidas es el grupo formado en la ciudad de Concepci\u00f3n.

She is married to Alberto, her business partner, and she is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 1,000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to be able to expand soon.

They have five children who they raised with much care and effort.  All three are now adults and independent, and only two are still living at home.  Rosa's work involves solving mechanical and electrical problems for transport vehicles.  She has a workshop that she runs out of her house.  Every day many drivers seek her out to fix their vehicles.  Her husband is the mechanic and she takes care of the paperwork and invoices.  They began the business 15 years ago and since then have been growing significantly with their vulcanization shop and, now, mechanical shop.  \r\n\r\nBusiness is going very well because they have good customers.  But like everyone, she has goals and wants to expand the workshop.  This is her fifth loan through MFP.  She is very content with the financial support because she is confident she will be able to progress in the business.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time, as with the previous loans.  She is happy with her communal bank because all the members are good, kind and very responsible.  The 3000 PEN loan will be used to buy materials and tools to continue providing excellent service at her workshop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":988765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials and tools for her workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T11:40:03Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":458.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":455.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":496.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":515.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":524.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":549.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.58},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":171.95,"local_amount":458.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":462.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246307},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":455.54,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":459.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386319},{"amount":186.25,"local_amount":496.68,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":501.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099412},{"amount":193.2,"local_amount":515.2,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":520.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713558},{"amount":196.58,"local_amount":524.21,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":529.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202446},{"amount":206.19,"local_amount":549.84,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":555.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098129}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T18:04:47Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":384667,"name":"Rhoda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rhoda is 30 years old and the single mother of one child aged 14 years.

She is married to Bejamine, a vendor, and is a mother of five children. She and her husband share responsibility in attending to their young children while at the same time earning an income for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nDarlyn is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is a well-known egg that is sold on the sidewalk. It is a fertilized duck egg that has not been hatched. Instead it is cooked as a boiled egg with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is a highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes their energy and strength. About 450-600 Balut eggs are boiled and sold every night. She and her husband do the selling to lessen expenses of paying commissions to vendors that will sell the eggs. They earn about 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nDarlyn is requesting a loan amounting to Php 12,000 that she will use as start-up capital for her additional business, which is selling quail eggs and fried chicken skin. The remaining amount will be spent on purchasing additional Balut eggs. There is a high demand for fried chicken skin, and she wants to give it a try since her stall is located in a crowded and busy area. \r\n\r\nDarlyn dreams of having a stall located in the market. She still has to wait a little bit more to make this come true because she has to prioritize being a mother to her young children. For now, Darlyn and her husband will just continue to lean on each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. Darlyn never fails to attend weekly fellowship* meetings as they inspire her to go on with their life no matter what the obstacles are, because she has a big God Who will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":991406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Now she lives in her own house together with her five beloved children, to whom she wants to offer a better quality of life. Cadith's work begins very early in the morning, when she opens her stall and begins with the sale of chickens. Her business is located in the market in her city. She is a very persuasive saleswoman, and she always succeeds in getting a smile from her customers. When she began this business, she recalls that she didn't know anything about it and had to work a lot, but, little by little, she succeeded in obtaining earnings. She has been in this business for six years, and up to now she has done it alone. In the future she would like to have a shop where she can sell chicken in a more peaceful setting. This will be her 18th loan with MFP, so she hopes for your help to continue with her goals. On her part, she promises once more to make her loan payments.

She used a starting capital of 5000 som (KGS) to purchase a few animals and has since grown and improved the business to yield 4000 som (KGS) monthly profits. In order to further develop her enterprise, Gulayim has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS). She is planning to use this loan to purchase another dairy cow with calf. In the future, Gulayim is hoping to use the profits from the loan to purchase even more animals for her herd. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":992218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toguz-Bulak village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulayim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":30369.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459393},{"amount":650,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":30369.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":449552757}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T03:41:45Z","paid_date":"2014-02-17T10:11:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":384774,"name":"Hagnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hagnes is a 56-year-old married woman.

He has worked very hard for many years to get his family ahead and give them everything they deserve. He has a grocery and it is his main source of income.\n\nHe started his business 8 years ago. His business was initially a cafe that didn`t require a large amount of capital but it was not running well enough to make much profit. Then, he was planning to develop his business so he sold his own land which was located in his village and therefore he opened a grocery.\n\nHis business is located in a very strategic area. Many people prefer his store because he always has the basic staples at affordable prices, and he provides the best possible customer service. His dream is to see his store flourish.  Due to the current bad situation in Yemen,  he has less profit from his enterprise. So, he took a youth loan of 100,000 YER to stock his business with more products so that his customers would always find what they need and keep coming back.\n\nIn the future, he would like expand his business in order to purchase a call center. With this investment he hopes to be able to get his family ahead and give them better opportunities in life.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":992318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":" to stock more products so that customers will always find what they need.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Sana'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdulrazaq","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":16690},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16662},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16662},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16662},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16662},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":16662}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.28,"local_amount":16690,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:19:44Z","rounded_local_amount":16985.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263232284},{"amount":79.14,"local_amount":16662,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":16956.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269957051},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16662,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16956.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563328},{"amount":79.14,"local_amount":16662,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16956.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050473},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16662,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":16956.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072014},{"amount":79.14,"local_amount":16662,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16956.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266885}],"funded_date":"2012-01-25T22:12:36Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":383207,"name":"Aracely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aracely del Carmen de 53 a\u00f1os es una mujer trabajadora y emprendedora  de 53 a\u00f1os quien se dedica a la compra y venta de chatarra junto a su esposo con lo cual le proporciono estudios a sus tres hijos que ya son mayores de edad.

To support her large family Jyldyzkan opened a grocery store in 1995. With a starting capital of 5,000 som (KGS) and a lot of hard work and perseverance Jyldyzkan expanded her business to yield 5,000 som (KGS) monthly profits. Aside from the grocery store the household also has two milk cows and the dairy sales provide an additional source of income for the family. \r\n\r\nIn order to further expand her business by expanding her grocery inventory, Jyldyzkan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS). She is going to invest the profits from this expansion to improve her grocery business. In the future Jyldyzkan is planning to develop both the grocery and dairy sales so that the two enterprises can support each other during the down seasons.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":992281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to broaden the assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kerben town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jyldyzkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":322.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975624},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10045.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285473},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339062},{"amount":215,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10045.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329662},{"amount":107.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5022.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070972},{"amount":322.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":15068.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459394}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T06:33:35Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":379676,"name":"Union San Jeronimo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Antonieta naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Cusco y vive en la misma ciudad donde naci\u00f3.

","en":"Saltanat is 46 years old, married and is raising three children.  In 2006, in search of an income source for her family, she started her own business of selling office and household goods, using a sum of 10,000 som (KGS) as an initial capital.  Traveling to a market to sell their merchandise, Saltanat and her husband put forth all their efforts to develop this business and achieved success.  Today, they have a goods turnover of about 50,000 som (KGS).  Currently, the goods selection is limited, and this is why Saltanat requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company.  Purchasing merchandise will allow her to expand the goods selection, increase the number of customers and increase sales.  Saltanat plans to invest the profits into purchasing a car in order to have an ability to sell her merchandise in remote

Since then, Kulbayra's herd has expanded and now has four milk cows and five sheep and the dairy sales result in a monthly profit of 15,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nIn order to purchase another dairy cow, Kulbayra has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 45,000 som (KGS). She is planning to use the profits from additional dairy sales to buy even more animals as well as start planting beans and potatoes for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":992556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Say village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulbayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":758.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":216.67,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":10102.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285476},{"amount":758.33,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":35358.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459397}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T17:11:15Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":384793,"name":"Hamisi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamisi is a 40-year-old married man.

In order to buy more cows and sheep for her herd, Asilkhan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS).

The countryside is \"her life\"; she was born and raised there. \r\n\r\nThat's why later on, she wishes to build a more secure house where she can live, and set up her own business.\r\n\r\nAs a longtime member of the communal bank, she feels grateful for all the support she receives from them, and she is sure she will be able to her fulfill her ambitions. Now she wants to devote herself fully to her planting, because this is the business that provides the income for her daily expenses. \r\n\r\nThis would be her tenth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for their support, and for the opportunity for development. She promises to pay her intallments on time. She belongs to the \"Los Pioneros de Cumutay\" communal bank, and feels happy to be a part of it, because of their common interests. \r\n\r\nShe will use the money to buy bags of pea seeds to begin planting by May or June.\r\n\r\n   "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":988547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-25T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-24T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":605.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400951}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T01:55:56Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":384808,"name":"Isaac","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isaac is 40 years old and married to Veronica, who is a farmer.

Maximiliana sells basic staples and she has a store in her house where she cheerfully takes care of customers.  She has had this business for more than 2 years and thanks to her own capital, she was able to open her own store.  What she likes about this work is that it allows her to keep her own schedule so that she doesn\u2019t neglect her house.  Also the earnings that have been generated help her with the household expenses.  What she doesn\u2019t like is that some of her customers ask for credit for their purchases and at the end, don\u2019t pay it off.\r\nHer biggest priority is to open another business, like a restaurant, in her house since she knows how to cook and wants to put her skills to use.  This will be her first loan with MFP.

Yuvicsa enjoys her business as it leaves her time free to work in other areas and also allows her to make income without much effort.  Owing to how profitable the rental business has been, she has plans to expand and build more rooms in her home so that she can rent them out and thereby make more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be Yuvicsa's fifth loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support as it makes her feel certain that she will make progress in her business.  She will invest the sum of 1,000 soles in repairing and fixing up her home for the comfort of her tenants."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":989522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to build more rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T00:20:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuvicsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":149.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":159.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":158.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":177.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":182.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.21,"local_amount":149.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":151.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246324},{"amount":119.41,"local_amount":318.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":321.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099430},{"amount":39.57,"local_amount":105.53,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713576},{"amount":159.81,"local_amount":426.14,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:03Z","rounded_local_amount":430.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098147}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T21:46:27Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":384865,"name":"Sulaiman A.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"We are very please to introduce to you Mr. Sulaiman, a secondary school teacher in Makeni, a city in northern Sierra Leone.

She lives together with her daughter Rosmery, who she cares for in her own home, in the village of Huasapuquio.  Victoria has been farming since she was very young.  This business allowed her to support her daughter through her own means as she doesn't have a husband.  In spite of the fact that she is now older and her daughter is independent, she continues working.  Her business is buying and selling fresh, good-quality cheese.  Every two weeks she travels to the country's capital city where she sells cheese to customers who are already familiar with her business.  In addition, she says that \"if strength is on her side\" she also sows corn, beans and potatoes, for her own consumption, in small vegetable gardens.  Victoria owns three cows and two calves that she provides with a lot of care as they provide her with the milk she needs to carry out her business.  However, as they don't produce milk constantly, she also buys cheese from third parties to fill her orders.\r\n\r\nThis is Victoria's sixth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can carry out her plans.

She has been living with her husband, Lucio, for 12 years. They have four children, all minors, whom they are raising in their own home, located in the city of Pampas. Her principal work is agriculture: she plants potatoes and maca (an indigenous root crop) on their own land in the upper area of the city.  She sells her crops at harvest to a well known market in the area.\r\n\r\nThree months ago Elizabeth opened a small grocery store where she sells fruit, milk and other staples. Consequently she does not have the same energy as before to do extensive planting. In addition her husband works in a mine where he earns a fixed wage that enables him to support their small children. She works hard because she has to care for her children alone during the week since her husband only returns from working on the weekends when the family is reunited. \r\n\r\nThis is Elizabeth\u2019s first loan with MFP and she awaits your collaboration so that she can concretize her plans.

She has been living with her husband, Ronald, for 5 years. They have two children, Ronald and Ana Lucia, whom they are raising in their own home located in the town of Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez. \r\n\r\nA little while ago Nelly had to take on a major responsibility when her mother died and left two minor brothers in her care. Very adeptly she saw in this loss an opportunity because she opened a small shoe store, together with her 18 year old brother, Romeld. She is certain she will be very successful because she believes in God and his infinite power. In addition she continues in agriculture, working as a laborer on land that is ready for harvest, where she receives a salary of 30 soles a day. Her husband helps her in any way he can, however when he has maintenance work from local government, he takes advantage of the opportunity to earn extra money and thereby support his family, while still helping his wife when possible. \r\n\r\nThis is Nelly\u2019s fourth loan with MFP where she awaits your collaboration so that she can concretize her plans. She promises to make all her payments on time. Also, she is glad to be part of the communal bank because all the members are responsible and supportive. Upon receiving your support, Nelly will invest the money in the purchase of material for her shoe store.

group. She is the mother of three children, who live with Manesa and her long-term partner in one of the slum neighborhoods located in the north of Santo Domingo. Manesa tells us that her most difficult challenge has been to devote herself as a mother to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nManesa is very excited to receive her fifth loan with Esperanza Internacional. She has had her business for around eleven years, after having arrived in the Dominican Republic and seen the need to start working. She used a little bit of capital for food sales. Manesa is planning to invest her new loan to purchase foods such as rice, beans, sugar, vegetables, cooking oil, and meats.

a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy trabajadora, vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y se dedica a la venta de desayunos y almuerzos, en  un local ubicado en la plaza mayorista del mercado p\u00fablico de los pl\u00e1tanos desde hace 5 a\u00f1os; aunque su experiencia data desde hace 8 a\u00f1os,  cuando empez\u00f3 en su propia casa,  con la venta de bollos de mazorca en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su

En Everlides aun persiste   su deseo de hacerlo crecer, y mejorar sus instalaciones cada vez m\u00e1s, pero su capital de trabajo resulta insuficiente para lograr las metas que se propone.

She has four children ranging in age from 9 to 18. She lives with her husband and she's a very hardworking woman. She sells breakfasts and lunches in a place located in the wholesale square of the public market of Los Pl\u00e1tanos. She has been doing this for five years, although her experience dates back eight years. That's when she, along with her husband, began selling corncob rolls from her own home, with very little working capital. Through their hard work, perseverance and work discipline, they succeeded in expanding the business into a rented spot at the commercial aisle in the market. Everlides still wishes to have the business grow and to keep on improving her facilities, but her working capital is insufficient for achieving her goals. This is the reason why she turns to credikiva, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will purchase supplies for food making, fix the kitchen counter and repair the fridge where she stores meat products. Her first customers were neighbors and local customers, and after she expanded into the spot where she is currently located, she gets customers such as the salespeople from both the formal and informal retail businesses around her. She has been getting along with them very well and for that reason she stayed there, expanded the business and now she has two employees under her supervision.

","en":"The newest members of the group are Maria de Guadalupe, who plans to use the loan to purchase firewood, and Ubalda, who is going to purchase candies. The other members continue developing their activities. Ubalda is 77 years old and married. Her husband is sick and doesn't work. She has 13 children, eight boys and five girls, all of whom are grown up. Ubalda has a post selling candy and is requesting the loan to purchase lollipops, caramels, marzipan, gum and chocolates. She started her business 10 years ago because she wanted to do something and keep busy. Her business is important because it raises revenue so she can keep eating and investing. She enjoys selling candy because children appreciate it, and her sales post is known for its customer service. Ubalda is happy about the loan and plans to use it to purchase candies to expand her business. She uses her profits for sustenance and to reinvest in candies of different flavors. Her hopes and dreams are for everyone to stay in good health and for her children to lack nothing. The group members thank Kiva and partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the loans and say \"We are happy that you are supporting us with the loans to grow our businesses.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":987538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase lollipops, candies, gum, chocolates, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T03:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Cleofas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ubalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193962},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330332},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044347},{"amount":418.75,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5517.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656542}],"funded_date":"2012-01-26T19:09:45Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:53:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":385069,"name":"Srei","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srei is a pig-raiser as well as a Khmer traditional wine distiller, who has been living in the Baray district of Kompong Tom province.

He is married to Helen, a housewife and mother to their only child. Ronald, together with his wife, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, he is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRonald operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. They sell these to junk shops like Ronald's for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries like factories and others of the like. Ronald's regular customers are from the local community. He earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, he is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP.

She educates them and raises them with solid values and moral behavior. She also works very hard to offer her children a good quality life. She buys and sells fish and distributes her product by foot to neighbors and sell them for reasonable prices. She has many clients since she sells the freshest and tastiest fish. She is a joyful seller who is always able to get a smile out of her customers. She likes her job since she makes high profits from her sales. She has been doing this for 11 years. In the beginning, it was complicated since she had to learn how to keep the fish fresh and in the process she lost a large investment. However, with time she learned how to maintain them fresh and is doing much better. In the future, she hopes to have a refrigerator to keep her fish fresh and not have to worry about them rotting.

She likes her job a lot because she enjoys having conversations with other sellers and also likes to offer her flowers to different people who come to visit their family member's tombs and mausoleums. She has been doing this for 11 years and is doing very well however she still does not feel satisfied since she wants to have a store that sells only flowers and feels this is the moment to grow her business and have her own locale.

Having carried out a large number of unsuccessful activities, she began buying and selling \"pagnes wax\" (highly decorative and colourful pieces of fabric) and kitchen utensils around five years ago. \r\n\r\nWith a view to responding better to ever-increasing customer demand, she decided to join the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, around two years ago. After four solidarity (group) loans with a women's association from her neighborhood, she is now on her first individual loan. This first loan will allow her to buy five pieces of \"pagnes wax\" and two parcels of cups in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso), which she will sell on a door-to-door basis in Sikasso to a customer base made up essentially of women. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she expects to make a monthly profit of 130,000FCFA, which will be used principally to expand her business, repay the interest on her loan and contribute to family expenses.

She is married to Danilo, and she is the mother to their five children.  She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nVictoria operates a variety store.  In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood.  It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg.  Antonia earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  Her store is located adjacent to her house.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operationing her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan.  She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVictoria dreams to be able to give all of her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

He learned the trade from his relatives. He works alone as his wife spends all her time taking care of their child and the household chores. He works 10 hours a day approximately. He wants to invest in more merchandise and in this way take advantage of the Christmas season during which sales are the highest in the year. He is thinking of buying clothes to increase his stock and thus offer his customers more options to secure the sale. This is his first loan and he feels very optimistic. Although prices have increased and his profit margin has beeen affected, Jorge believes that with this investment he can make good profits again.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":962928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Geovanny","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1067.2,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":76.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":81.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":84.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":86.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":95.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":96.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":98.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.71},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.1},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.9},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.26,"local_amount":158.1,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-19T07:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":159.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316994},{"amount":84.78,"local_amount":84.17,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270032869},{"amount":85.29,"local_amount":84.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":85.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645061},{"amount":87.4,"local_amount":86.77,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283134322},{"amount":88.64,"local_amount":87.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":88.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092668},{"amount":90.71,"local_amount":90.05,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":90.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334460},{"amount":185.99,"local_amount":184.65,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":185.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308149389},{"amount":193.47,"local_amount":192.06,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":193.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322989619},{"amount":99.46,"local_amount":98.74,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:19:53Z","rounded_local_amount":99.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331126039}],"funded_date":"2012-02-02T19:38:00Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T13:19:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":375462,"name":"Luis Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis de 33 a\u00f1os de edad vive en el municipio de Puerto Colombia, a orillas del mar con su esposa y su hijo de 6 a\u00f1os de edad; \u00e9l tiene una tienda salsamentar\u00eda con la que genera el ingreso de su hogar y est\u00e1 ubicada al norte de la Ciudad de Barranquilla.

In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and other prepared foods cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nCarolina wants to grow the business in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
