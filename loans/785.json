She lives with Carlos, who is 42 years old, and they have three children.  They are why she works so much -- in order to offer them a better quality of life.  Gladys's work consists of buying and selling used devices like small electrical appliances or other recycled materials, as well as repairing things for her clients who bring them to her to fix.  Every day, she opens the doors of her home to begin her work. Her merchandise is acquired through recycling, since some people come to her house to make donations and she restores things in order to sell them.  She has been working in this field for 13 years and she does it along with her partner Carlos.  She feels very good about her work since it permits her to have a good income as well as to work at home and see and care for her children as she desires.  At first when she started the business she only did repairs, but with time the clients started leaving their own items for her to sell.  Now things are going well since the business generates good income.  For that reason she wants to purchase more used items in order to repair them and get them working.  This will be her first credit with Kiva partner MFP, and she is hoping for your help so that she can make her plans a reality.  For her part, she promises to punctually meet the scheduled loan repayments and she hopes to integrate quickly into the communal bank since she has heard great things about its collegiality and solidarity.  With the loan that she has requested of 1000 Peruvian soles, she will buy more used items that have fallen out of use as well as parts in order to restore them and put them up for sale.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":989413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"To purchase used devices \/ small electrical appliances and parts in order to restore the items and sell them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T18:10:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":153.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":151.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":174.51},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":183.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.73,"local_amount":153.95,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":155.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246313},{"amount":56.87,"local_amount":151.65,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386325},{"amount":62,"local_amount":165.34,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":166.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099419},{"amount":64.32,"local_amount":171.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":173.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713565},{"amount":65.44,"local_amount":174.51,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":176.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202453},{"amount":68.64,"local_amount":183.04,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":184.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098136}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T00:34:49Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Debra and Chris McMahon","image":121443}},{"id":383906,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flora, de 52 a\u00f1os es una mujer trabajadora.

base de masa de ma\u00edz, envueltos en hojas de mazorca y cocidos o sancochados, t\u00edpicos y profundamente arraigados en la Costa Caribe colombiana , donde son  preparados y vendidos en las calles por vendedores ambulantes, entre ellos mujeres  con sus inconfundibles pregones, que gradualmente siendo apoyadas en cr\u00e9ditos y logrando el crecimiento de su negocio, tambi\u00e9n  consiguen  de clientes a tiendas de barrio y negocios estacionarias informales al pie de los supermercados o dentro de ellos.  Esta tradici\u00f3n pas\u00f3 a ser parte del quehacer diario de  Ana, de ascendencia y tradici\u00f3n palanquera,  quien aprendi\u00f3 de su madre y posteriormente  tom\u00f3 su mayor experiencia, ayudando a sus hermanas, que se dedicaron de manera independiente  a lo mismo una vez muri\u00f3 su progenitora. En la actualidad aunque aun trabajan en la casa paterna,  tienen familias independientes, trabajan unidas y  eso si cada una con sus propios clientes, para lograr el sostenimiento de sus hogares. Ana es una mujer emprendedora y se apoya en sus sobrinos para la producci\u00f3n y distribuci\u00f3n de los bollos en 6 tiendas  y un restaurante, ella vende a cr\u00e9dito en las ma\u00f1anas y recupera su dinero en las horas desde la noche.

Su \u00e9xito radica en poder hacer una inversi\u00f3n en mayores cantidades  que lo usual, pues compra a diario y esto no la deja acceder a los descuentos propios de las compras de contado y en mayor volumen.\n\n","en":"\"Bollos\" [rolls made of white corn] are a food of indigenous origin.  They are handmade with corn dough and wrapped in corn husks and cooked or boiled.  They are traditional and deeply rooted in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where they are prepared and sold on the street by street vendors.  Among them are women, with their unmistakable hawking, who are gradually being helped by loans and are achieving the growth of their businesses.  They also get customers from stores in the neighborhood and stationary informal businesses outside or inside supermarkets.\r\n\r\nThis tradition came to be part of the daily chores of Ana, who is of Palenque ancestry and tradition.  [Palenque is a Spanish Creole language.]  She learned it from her mother and later got her best experience helping her sisters, who worked in the same business independently once their mother died.  Currently, although they still work in the family home, they have their own families and work together, each one with her own customers, to support their households.\r\n\r\nAna is an enterprising woman who relies on her nephews for producing and distributing the rolls in six stores and one restaurant.  She sells on credit in the morning and collects her money in the evening.\r\n\r\nAna finished high school and took degree courses in computer science and industrial machine operation.  She dreams about being a professional nurse as well as about getting a quality university education for her children, so they can improve themselves and be very successful.  This is exactly the goal of her persistent work, from which she wants to realize all her potential growth in machine equipment and generating employees.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is requesting a Kiva loan, the first financing she is getting from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it she will buy ingredients such as corn, husks for wrapping, and twine to tie up the products.\r\n\r\nHer success lies in being able to invest in larger quantities than normal, since she buys daily and this does not allow her to get the discounts characteristic of wholesale and cash purchases.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":988531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients such as corn, husks for wrapping, and twine to tie up the products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-26T18:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-25T18:40:02Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":61506},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74608},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76349},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78130},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79953},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81819},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83728},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85682},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87681},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89727},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":91820},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":108997}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.03},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.98},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.35},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.83,"local_amount":61506,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":61702.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039184},{"amount":83.02,"local_amount":150957,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":151440.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140922},{"amount":42.97,"local_amount":78130,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78380.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338440},{"amount":43.97,"local_amount":79953,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":80208.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395013},{"amount":45,"local_amount":81819,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:07Z","rounded_local_amount":82080.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774836},{"amount":46.05,"local_amount":83728,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83995.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386826},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":73582,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":73817.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519003},{"amount":41,"local_amount":74547,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":74785.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347070877},{"amount":173.69,"local_amount":315778,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":316788.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372928782}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T14:39:38Z","paid_date":"2013-06-18T09:27:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":383670,"name":"Lisset Vanesa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lisset es una mujer de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, ella vive en Ica ,Per\u00fa esta ciudad se encuentra ubicado en el Desierto de Sechura cerca de cuatro horas al sur de Lima, la capital del pa\u00eds, y es aclamado por los peruanos como \"La Tierra del Sol\".

Many people that work in the sector are passers-by. Hugo has been linked to the loan programs of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 11 years, in which he has received 9 loans that have permitted him to modernize his assets, like the fryer, to cool the business with a large tent, to buy seating, and to invest in a larger volume of raw materials and to open up another point of sales in a busy location that his own son attends to. At present, he plans to access a kiva loan that he will invest in raw materials and supplies in order to stock the new point of sales. This investment will be successful, for he is achieving purchases in volumes that facilitate discounts and because it will take place in a period in which sales usually increase. This increase is due to the fact that there is money in the market as a result of bonuses and allowances given to the employees of businesses that move the economy. With his business Hugo has achieved the maintenance of his household consisting of his wife and his 5 children that today are in the age range of 26 to 33 years old.

Her main activity is selling basic staples in her grocery store where she opens up her doors starting very early every morning to start selling to residents in the area.  In the afternoons she heads out to her fields where she grows potatoes, corn and peas that she\u2019s been tending to for 20 years.  \r\n\r\nNow that her mother is no longer able to help her with these tasks, she has to figure out how to do it alone in order not to neglect production.  In all this time she was able to learn not only farming techniques but also how to sell her crops at good prices.  In the city\u2019s wholesale market she\u2019s the one that always has the most success.  But her hobby is taking care of her animals, cows and calves; this is how she relaxes and amuses herself.

They wish to provide a better life for their families and their fellow countrymen with their small businesses. All of the people in this group have dreams and faith in God, so to them, nothing is impossible.\r\nThe leader of this group is Beda Sof\u00eda, a humble and hardworking lady with dreams that have yet to be fulfilled. She sells tamales with chicken and chipile, raw pork meat, chicken with pepper and garlic, clam and iguana.\r\nShe is 40 years old and happily married to Mart\u00edn, a hardworking gentleman who has been in bricklaying for the past two years.\r\nDo\u00f1a Beda, as she is known to her fellow group members, reports that she also sells chickens, feathered, butchered or seasoned. She has been selling chicken for ten years and she enjoys to go out and make her sales in the afternoons. In the mornings she only sells at her home, because she needs to prepare lunch for her children.\r\nShe has four children who help her sell chicken in the afternoons. Their names are Felipe, Ana Luisa, Andrea and Daniela.\r\nHer daughter Ana Luisa works at a drugstore and in the afternoons she goes to the neighboring areas to offer seasoned chicken. She also likes to sell chicken and help her mother, since Do\u00f1a Beda has worked hard in order to make her children proud of her.\r\nShe also sells medicinal plants.\r\nShe requested the loan in order to purchase more chickens for selling. She comments that she would like to have a poultry farm so she can sell them by wholesale in neighboring villages.\r\nThe other member of the group are:\r\nMagali Beatriz, who sells

Esta forma de trabajo le permite generar recursos para apoyar a su familia, pues ella vive en concubinato y tiene tres hijos.  \n\nCuando se le consulta qu\u00e9 le gusta de Pro Mujer, ella responde que le gusta la capacitaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn la fotograf\u00eda no aparece la se\u00f1ora Yhovana ya que se encontraba en consulta m\u00e9dica.\n","en":"The \u201cBLANCA NIEVES\u201d Communal Bank will initiate its first loan cycle with Pro Mujer as part of its Santiago II central office. It is composed of eleven members under a board of directors led by Sra. Tomasa. The businesses of the bank\u2019s members are varied: among them we have a variety of woven goods, the sale of  chicharr\u00f3nes (pork rinds), the sale of sweets, public transportation, pants making, knitted sweaters, cattle sales, perfume sales, wallet sales and pastry sales.\r\n\r\nSra. Tomasa notes that this is her first time working with Pro Mujer and that she joined the institution at the invitation of her brother-in-law. Currently she has a knitted goods business that she has been working at for some time.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to expand her capital to buy wool which she will acquire wholesale from La Ceja and later knit and sell at her sales stall. This kind of work enables her to generate earnings to support her family since she lives with her partner and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she enjoys the training.\r\n\r\nIn the photo Sra. Yhovana is missing because she had to see a doctor. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":988708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":115,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerson Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leydi Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola Ruth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magaly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yhovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Hilda\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cistina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26767.65,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5353.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5353.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785.01},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":785},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":784.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":785.01,"local_amount":5353.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5385.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418170},{"amount":785,"local_amount":5353.57,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":5385.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133051},{"amount":1570.01,"local_amount":10707.14,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10770.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749863},{"amount":784.98,"local_amount":5353.37,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5384.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243347}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T23:21:20Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":375791,"name":"Maritza Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maritza, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo era la compra de mercader\u00eda agregando m\u00e1s rubros al negocio como son pl\u00e1sticos, focos, carteras, para diversificar el negocio y ofrecer al cliente mayor mercader\u00eda, la intenci\u00f3n de ella es que sus clientes puedan encontrar varias clases de productos para generar m\u00e1s ventas.\nElla considera que estos pr\u00e9stamos le han ayudado a superarse tanto ella como su familia, adquiriendo mayor experiencia y obteniendo mayores ganancias.\n","en":"Maritza has decided to apply for a new loan.

There she has her own store, selling ranches, food, groceries and beverages.  This business was started when she reached the city of Cartagena in 2002, as a separated woman with her two children. So it was with the help of her brother that she began with a small shop in order to raise her children and provide them with opportunities for education and welfare, as has now happened, they have succeeded in college and have become hard working people of good character. With her growth potential and desire to excel personally, she has strengthened her business.  She has been linked to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organization with which she has had 3 loans, and currently she is applying to KIVA, which is the fourth financing. With this she will increase her capital a little more, taking advantage of approaching the time of peak sales, in which Alicia must be prepared with a great merchandise assortment in order to increase her income and position herself even more. For that, she will buy drinks, soft drinks, groceries, meats, among other items, in greater volume than usual, in order to obtain better discounts and manage her products with special

In order to further develop her business, Santalat has turned to \"Bai Tushum and Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS).

","en":"Hurshed is a young man, he is married and is a father of two children. His wife is a homemaker, she is raising children. Hurshed sells electrical stoves and appliances on the market. During the summer he seals and cans pickled products and compotes. He is a master of his craft and has many loyal wholesale customers. He lives in a sectioned apartment. He was able to renovate the apartment and upgrade sewer pipes using the collected profit.\r\n\r\nHurshed has been taking out loans at this organization for the fourth year and has never violated the terms of lending. He is pleased to collaborate and expand his business. He wants to buy several types of electrical stoves using the received loan and to stock up on empty glass containers for sealing of the pickles in the summer because those can be purchased cheaply during off-season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":993275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrical

little place by a busy road in the city which has been operating more like a little grocery store for the past five years, but recently Faruk introduced an outside grilling oven to his store. Since then he is also able to sell meat, mostly grilled chicken. Meat is rather expensive to buy in his city; however, fried chicken or other poultry is usually part of the typical meal. Because electricity problems make it difficult for individual households to keep meat, baked products are well sought after.\r\n\r\nFaruk took a loan from Relief International - Iraq in the amount of $2,700 to continue his store's improvement, and to be able to stock the store with the items he used to sell before the introduction of the grilling oven as well as to continue to produce the baked meat products.

","en":"The Nianghou Ndierignou group is composed of women from the same neighborhood who have formed a \"tontine\" (a revolving system whereby each member contributes periodically an agreed amount and this is passed on in rotation to the different members). They trade in groceries, notably vegetables, fish and basic food products. The sell their goods on tables that are installed in the small neighborhood market or, in some cases, in front of their houses. They are all married with several children. The leader of the group (dressed in a black \"boubou\" on the right) sells fresh, smoked and dried fish as well as vegetables.

He graduated from the Kapan construction vocational school and is a construction worker by trade. Garnik is married and has two children. Garnik's wife is a homemaker; his older daughter studies in the civil engineering faculty at the Kapan Polytechnical Institute; and his younger daughter finished secondary school this year.\r\n\r\nGarnik has been doing shoe repairs for 20 years. Ganik has his own machines and shoe molds, but he leases the shop where he operates his business. Once a month he purchases materials in the city of Erevan.\r\n\r\nGarnik always has many clients because he does high-quality and quick work. Garnik works late into the evening, which allows clients to stop by at the end of their work day.\r\n\r\nThanks to his own business Garnik supports his family and pays for the education of his older daughter. Garnik needs a loan of 1,000,000 dram to acquire equipment (a machine for sewing chains to boots) for his workshop, as well as to purchase materials (leather, soles, etc.)\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":963649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

is 44 years old.  She is married and has two children aged 21 and 16.  In 2000, she established  her milk selling business.  Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young milk-giving cow. \r\n\r\n In the future, Shova plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.

For this cause, he is hoping for the loan to proceed with the school support of his little ones.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":991779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"o buy school supplies, uniforms, and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T16:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T16:00:10Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":469},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":682.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":684.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":714.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":728.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":757.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":774.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":798.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":827.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":848.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":877.51},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":902},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":936.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.23},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.49},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.11,"local_amount":557.91,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-12T07:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":578.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263279361},{"amount":29.93,"local_amount":665.02,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-20T08:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":689.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270755998},{"amount":27.59,"local_amount":613.37,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-06T08:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":635.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277196227},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":714.09,"processed_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-14T07:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":740.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283098091},{"amount":32.76,"local_amount":728.06,"processed_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-12T08:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":754.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286830714},{"amount":155.35,"local_amount":3452.32,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3578.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294538602},{"amount":147.12,"local_amount":3269.23,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-16T09:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3388.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315354742}],"funded_date":"2012-01-27T20:37:56Z","paid_date":"2012-12-16T09:39:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":385477,"name":"Fatmata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Sierra Leone!

She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Two of her children are currently attending nursery school. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Isata established her water purifying business. She began her business because she thinks that a lot of citizens are suffering and want to drink pure water. She says that the main challenges to her business are waste of plastic and insufficient electricity power supply. She has 10 employees working for her.

raising five children.  Her family's primary business is animal husbandry and farming.  In 2005, Salkyngul decided to get involved in fattening up and reselling livestock, having invested an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock.  Today, her business contains ten sheep, one bull and one horse, and yields a monthly income of 8,000 som.  The profits from her business allow Salkyngul to pay for her oldest son's education.  In order to further develop her business, Salkyngul requested a loan in the sum of 110,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep.  She plans to direct the profits from the loan to the remodeling of her

Lilian has worked for a long time to get her family ahead, and for the moment, she's the one who continues to fight to improve their living conditions. Her husband is retired and cannot keep on working due to an illness that prevents him from doing a lot of things. Lilian owns a snack bar at a local private school where she sells snacks to students. Besides, on weekends and in the afternoons she sells typical food such as nu\u00e9gados (a type of sweet), atoles (a type of drink), fried yucca, enchiladas, etc. at  her home. She succeeded in establishing and maintaining both businesses for many years with a lot of hard work. She is very well-known in her neighborhood because she is an enterprising, hardworking and charismatic woman. Her dream is to provide education for her children so that she can see them become professionals with better living conditions than she and her husband had. All of that motivates her to keep on working in order to achieve her dream one day. She has decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL in order to invest it in her business by purchasing goods (beans, beverages, snacks, buns, milk, rice, sugar, coffee, paper, etc.) that will allow her to increase her profits.

Like many immigrant entrepreneurs, Ruben realized that without credit it would be difficult to secure business capital from a commercial bank. For three years, Ruben received credit counseling while working two jobs - as a full time cook at Pollo Tropical and part-time at a packaging company - all to save money for his business. In 2000, as a result of Ruben\u2019s determination and hard work, he was able to start an exporting business that initially relied heavily on his connection in Peru, a large buyer of medical hearing devices. Recently, Ruben has been approached by buyers all over Latin America and he needs capital to respond to the growing demand.  By raising capital for Ruben\u2019s loan, he will be able to purchase the inventory he needs to export medical hearing devices overseas.

She runs her own store as a Champion Agent for Mobile Transactions in Solwezi providing money transfer services to her community. She started her business in July 2011 because she has always wanted to have a business of her own and when the opportunity came through Mobile Transactions, she took it. Within a month of starting her business Angela was already doing more than 1000 money transfers a month. \r\n\r\nAccess to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, 80% of the population, do not have bank accounts. As most Zambians live in rural areas, distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Mobile Transactions Zambia Limited (MTZL) is an early stage company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction service by propagating an open network using small businesses called Champion Agents. Angela is a Champion Agent. This is her story. \r\n\r\nAngela believes her community benefits from her business in a very positive way because the service she provides is faster compared to other money transfer services and more often has enough cash to pay out receiving customers. She currently has one employee and two teller windows, which she uses to serve her customers. \r\n\r\nWhen Angela receives her loan she will be able to increase her float money (electronic and cash value of her working capital) which will enable her to satisfy more customers. She also wants to use the loan money to pay for her booth which she is currently using to serve her customers. Angela is hopeful that once she has increased her float money she will be able to earn more commissions and have enough money to have her children, who are currently living with her parents in Lusaka province 12 hours away, come live with her. \r\n\r\nIn the video, a representative of MTZL interviews Angela."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":944523,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2514,"youtubeId":"T6SMGoCgKQc","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Angela from  Zambia","thumbnailImageId":944523},"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"To pay for her booth and increase her electronic and cash working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Solwezi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2012-01-27T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-26T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":399.03,"local_amount":399.03,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":399.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276926971},{"amount":430.97,"local_amount":430.97,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:34:09Z","rounded_local_amount":430.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283208766},{"amount":556.14,"local_amount":556.14,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":556.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287634820},{"amount":639.1,"local_amount":639.1,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T11:07:08Z","rounded_local_amount":639.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294480087},{"amount":727.84,"local_amount":727.84,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":727.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301533498},{"amount":547.77,"local_amount":547.77,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-30T08:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":547.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308301560},{"amount":776.63,"local_amount":776.63,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T16:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":776.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315533399},{"amount":770.38,"local_amount":770.38,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":770.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323132501},{"amount":152.14,"local_amount":152.14,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":152.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331281395}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T22:21:11Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T16:40:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":9,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":375443,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos de 54 a\u00f1os de edad es un hombre casado que vive en la ciudad de Cartagena y  tiene 4 hijos en las edades de 24 a 27 a\u00f1os.

her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Her group is located in the urban slums surrounding Santiago, an area known for its tobacco production, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and three children.\r\n\r\nTeresa plans to use this loan to invest in her business of selling miscellaneous products. She will invest this loan to buy clothing, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. She will use the profit to reinvest in her business and to save for the future.

Se\u00f1ora Maria is an incredible woman, charismatic and hard-working. Every day she goes through the environs of her community to offer cartons of eggs to the various shops. She has a number of regular clients, as much for the egg business as for the sale of her delicious tortillas. Like every entrepreneurial woman, she does not tire of working and betting on a better quality of life. She has thought a lot about the possibility of improving her income, and she arrived at the conclusion that the way to do it is by investing in her businesses to give better service to her customers and thus be able to improve her income. This brought her to take the decision to apply for this loan at INTEGRAL to buy eggs, firewood, corn, and other products that will permit her to improve her service. She does all this with the goal of improving her living conditions and those of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":991833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He is a trained construction worker and, as an owner of a herd of sheep and goats, has a great deal of experience in animal husbandry. During the summer season Abdunazar works in construction and in winter he fattens and sells livestock, using the weekends to buy and sell animals on the market. He generally dislikes to be idle as he is solely responsible for financial well being of his family. Most women in the region do not work, and it is hard for the men to be sole providers, but they make due. Currently the market price of livestock has fallen and Abdunazar wants to seize the moment to buy five more sheep for his herd.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":992446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Teodora is a businesswoman who runs a stall at the Tirol waterfall, a tourist attraction that is visited by both local and international tourists. There she sells handicrafts such as bracelets, necklaces, earrings and ornaments for the home, all of which are made out of seeds from exotic plants. \u201cWhat I sell the most are the handcrafted monkeys made from coconuts at 10 soles, but I buy them at 5 so I earn double\u201d she says. Teodora also sells soft drinks and juice made from regional fruits such as cocona, aguaje and star fruit. \r\n\r\nIn the evenings Teodora sells kebabs, which are heartily welcomed by visitors. During the holiday months, at the end of the year and on national holidays her sales increase, due to the high influx of tourists.
