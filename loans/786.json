He thinks that it's going well with his business because he is very organized, serves customers well, and also because his sister helps him lot when he isn't in the caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\nJaime is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to their help he will be able to buy two more computers for his business. This way he will have more machines available to serve customers, and they will be more satisfied with his services. This way he will have more income, so that he will be able  to continue saving, and fulfill his greatest dreams:  \"Completing his university degree, expanding his business, and being his parents' pride.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":991802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet

They live in their own house where the family rule is mutual help and understanding.  Even as a boy, Calixto worked hard, helping his parents on their farm, but for the past 30 years he has made a living farming his own land, growing cacao.  His creativity and drive to get ahead have paid off.  His cacao beans are especially valued for their quality and bring him a good living.  He can normally operate the farm alone but he has to hire day laborers to help him harvest his crop.  The extra help allows him to bring the crop in faster and ensures a better yield.  For the future, he wants to continue expanding production so that he can meet demand from his customers and improve his quality of life.  This will be Calixto's first MFP loan.

He sells fish in the morning from one house to another, whereas in the afternoon he sells broilers using a cart. The income he earns is spent to fulfill the needs of the family, buy medicine for his father and pay the school expenses of Viola. \r\n\r\nDaniel dreams of improving his broiler business as the business has a good opportunity in the future. He plans to purchase more chicks and feed but he needs more money to do so. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of IDR 4,000,000. This loan will be spent on two boxes of chicks and feed for them.

She has operated a business selling fabrics, veils, scarfs and various clothes for twenty years. She will use her loan to purchase some clothing to sell to women. \r\n\r\nNour`s most important challenges are to work hard to gain extra income and to better her business structure. She is receiving a loan of 50,000 YER from AMB and, because her loan repayments have all been made punctually, she has been able to grow her business with the reinvestment she makes from each loan. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Nour would like to save her profit to start building her house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":993447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase some clothing goods to sell to women.

She raised her two sons, Cesar and Andre, by herself in her own home, located in the town of El Tambo. She is a fighter, driven to get ahead in life. \r\n\r\nShe works at several jobs. In the mornings, she works at a house where she cooks and cleans. From that, she is paid a monthly salary. In the afternoons she supervises the lumber mill that she rents to some people who pay her on a monthly basis. Since the land was inherited by both her and her brother, they divide the earnings equally. In the evenings, she takes care of the market in her town, where the owners pay her for her services. These activities allow her to earn a living, and above all, pay for the university education of her two sons, who study law and political science in a private institution. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she hopes that through her collaboration with MFP, she can realize her plans. She is committed to making her loan payments. In addition, she is thankful to be a part of the association because all of the members are responsible and unified. Yolanda will invest her loan in her children\u2019s studies.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":993526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2012-01-28T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T16:20:06Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416571},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-25T08:04:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131372},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947171},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296560},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-23T08:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294646218},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-01T08:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302226891},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-24T10:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315489441},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-27T10:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323094418},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-20T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":5000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332200654}],"funded_date":"2012-01-28T18:17:53Z","paid_date":"2013-01-20T10:30:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":385925,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is a 35-year-old married woman with 4 children who are enrolled in school.

It\u2019s a neighbourhood where formal businesses are mixed in with informal businesses, recreational areas, family homes, and apartments. Most importantly for Colombians, it contains the Metropolitan Stadium, one of the most important places for professional football in the country. It\u2019s the home of Junior, a much-loved team from the Caribbean coast.\r\n\r\nThis is where Carmen has her business. She sells medicines, stationery, and various other items as well as offering cellular phone service. She began this business in 2008 after selling clothes for over thirty years. The store is open seven days a week from 7am to 10pm. These long hours are very competitive and will result in many potential customers who recognize that Carmen offers very good prices and unequalled service. \r\n\r\nThe anticipated growth of the business has made Carmen think of the need for more working capital so she can buy in greater volume and get discounted prices. As a result she has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation for her first loan. With the money she plans to buy underwear for which she has orders, school supplies, and a display case. This investment will bring success as it is backed by requests from her customers, she will buy at special seasonal prices, and because she will sell the items at the time when customers need them. It is easy to see that Carmen has lots of business experience."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":966013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy underwear, school supplies, and a display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-27T16:20:10Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66950},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":74735},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76479},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78263},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80089},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81958},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83870},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85827},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":87830},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89879},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91977},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":102143}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.28},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.15,"local_amount":66950,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":67468.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325077},{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":74735,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":75313.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039136},{"amount":34.88,"local_amount":66431,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":66945.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338397},{"amount":5.28,"local_amount":10048,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":10125.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394976},{"amount":6.82,"local_amount":12995,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":13095.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386795},{"amount":403.64,"local_amount":768841,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":774789.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993682}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T20:01:50Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":385023,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia continua con su negocio de venta de muebles y colchones, la socia esta creciendo con su negocio y ahora requiere el prestamo para invertir en la compra de muebles y colchones al por mayor y comprara de la fabrica y lo repartira  a sus clientes y otra parte ella lo vendera de forma independiente.

He has been in this work for 30 years and what he considers the most difficult is transporting the sacks of his crops to the distribution centers that he uses to get a good price for the good quality of his crops.  This is his first loan with MFP.  He feels very pleased to know that he will find support from the financiers and this way he can continue with his business plans.

Maura is a profit-making woman. She works with great conscientiousness to plow the land to then grow cacao plants, work that she has been doing for more than 35 years. She does this in addition to taking care of her parents, since they are elderly and need attention. Maura, with the help of her partner, can carry out this work on her farm because thanks to it, they can pay for the family expenses. At harvest time, she can count on the help of her children and day laborers. This way she can extract the fruits rapidly to then offer the harvest to the cooperatives in her district. Nevertheless, it is difficult for her to transport her sacks of harvested cacao to the cooperative centers. On the other hand, her priority now is to expand her fields of cultivation and in this way to increase her production and finally to obtain good economic stability.

He lives with his family in the community of Canalette, in the region of Upala, San Carlos, in the province of Alajuela. This province is the biggest producer in the country of coffee and cane sugar. It also produces staple crops (rice, beans, corn), fruit, vegetables, root vegetables, and greens, and it is one of the main livestock areas of the country, especially the canton of San Carlos. The province is also the home of the milk processing plans of the milk producing cooperative Leche Dos Pinos, which belongs to thousands of milk producers. What is more, in the area around the city of Alajuela, many businesses that manufacture for export have opened-up. Alajuela operates free trade zones in El Coyol, Saret, Montecillos, and Bet. \r\nSince some time back, Carlos Luis has needed greater investment to meet the needs of his family and continue his business. He needs capital so that his business can thrive and the residents of his community can benefit. His project is unusual and interesting. \r\nCurrently, Carlos Luis is requesting a micro loan of $1,200 to buy and sell silkscreened t-shirts. He hopes that this will make his business grow as his goal is to be able to continue with his work and so to improve his quality of life and his home. \r\nCarlos Luis is a member of the community bank Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Canalette, one of the 150 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She is married to Arnel, a driver. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She works hard to continually provide for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nUrsula maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk and Marikina Shoe Exchange. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer on one-month-to-pay credit terms. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and this profit is the dealer's income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 2000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a Php29,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands.  \r\n\r\nUrsula hopes to grow her business in the coming years.

She is an entrepreneur and runs a small company with much growth potential.  She was born in Barranquilla which gave her a free, cheerful spirit that captivates the people around her.  Her father being \"Antioque\u00f1o\" and her mother \"Santandereana\", has given her a determined character and disciplined working habits, which she uses to run her store.  She started her business in 2010 with her mother's advice.  Daniela has strengthened the business with the marketing expertise she learned through corporate sales and marketing training.\r\n\r\nIn her store, Daniela not only sells groceries, canned goods, liquors, meats, eggs, etc., but also has a main goal of being able to meet all the needs of the typical shopping basket for all the families who live nearby.  Housewives and neighbors meet at her store to share time together.  They pay in cash but sometimes receive short-term credit terms.  Daniela wants to study social communication and her greatest challenge is having the income, through her store, to do so.  Daniela's accounts receivable turnover is two days, and her inventory turnover is 15 days.  These are the financial indicators she uses for company growth.  She will use the Credikiva loan, her first through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy groceries, canned goods, liquors, wholesale, so she can obtain better discounts and payment terms in the market so she can meet her goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":992940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries, canned food, and liquors wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-29T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-28T13:00:03Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77412},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84492},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86463},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88481},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90545},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92658},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94820},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97032},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99296},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101613},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103984},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113204}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.73},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.52},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.55,"local_amount":161904,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":162262.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039193},{"amount":47.82,"local_amount":86463,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":86654.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651324},{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":88481,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":88676.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140931},{"amount":50.08,"local_amount":90545,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":90745.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100825},{"amount":51.25,"local_amount":92658,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":92863,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338450},{"amount":52.44,"local_amount":94820,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":95029.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395020},{"amount":53.67,"local_amount":97032,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":97246.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386832},{"amount":231.25,"local_amount":418097,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":419021.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993714}],"funded_date":"2012-01-29T21:16:20Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":385571,"name":"Miryan Maricela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miryan de 22 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora que comenz\u00f3 como vendedora de cosm\u00e9ticos y joyas para poder ayudar con los gastos familiares ya que tiene 4 hijos. \n\nComenz\u00f3 a vender cosm\u00e9ticos desde las 08h00am para mejorar sus ingresos.

Two of her children are now living independently.  They have their own families and always look out for their mother.  Evarista continues caring for her remaining child who she loves very much.  For this reason, every day from Monday to Friday she works in a mine in the high area of the city.  There she mines gold, silver and copper, and earns a good wage for it.  This allows her to cover her expenses.  She tells us that she often pans the waste products which are thrown out of the mine and extracts small nuggets which she sells to jewelry stores in the city.  This makes her extra money.  However, as she doesn't always have this income, she started a small business buying sheep and grain which she sells in the country's capital city on the weekend when she has a break from her job.\r\n\r\nEvarista belongs to the \"Chilca' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

She lives together with Eder, her husband of 7 years.  The couple have two children, Mariangel and Farid, who they care for in their own home.  Their home is located in the town of Hualahoyo.  Magaly's main job is making bricks.  She carries out this work together with her husband.  Her job consists of preparing the molds which are then fired in the oven.  She says that she makes 25 thousand bricks a month and sells them to a well-known supplier who always visits her factory.  However, when she obtains a better offer, she goes to the country's capital city to sell her bricks.  Alongside this work, Magaly also grows corn and potatoes in partnership with a lady who owns farmland.  They share expenses and, when harvest time comes, they divide the profits.  She sells the crops that she grows in the capital, where she also takes vegetables to sell in the wholesale market.  Right now, Magaly would like to put together some money to buy a truck.\r\n\r\nMagaly is a member of the \"Barrio Oriental\" community bank and this is her thirteenth loan from MFP.

He has been working there for one year. In addition to working at the library, Jonius also cultivates vegetables: cucumbers, cassava, papayas, cashews, corn, peanuts and string beans at their farm in his spare time. Jonius is assisted by his wife, Feronika, in taking care their farm and selling the crops as well while he is at the library.\r\n \r\nJonius is thinking to improve his business; he wants to buy seedlings, fertilizer, and pesticides. In addition, Jonius wants to buy firewood to resell at the market. This situation led him to request a loan amounting to IDR 5,000,000 from TLM for his business improvement.
