He lives with his wife, Ani, and their daughter, Maricielo--who they dearly love--in a rented house in Chilca.  Carlos was born in the city of Huancayo, but his parents are from the country and he\u2019s proud of them for that.  Carlos has always worked hard.  His plan is to build a small house on a plot of land in the city, left to him by his mother.  He started his taxi business to raise the money he needs.  He drives the route between Huancayo and the city of Huancavelica, a trip that he makes once or twice [a day, a week?\u2014not clear] and he\u2019s happy with his earnings from the business.  His wife has a crafts business, turning wire and thread into human figures.  She makes around a thousand of the figures a day and is well paid for her work.  Carlos wants to drive larger buses, but he needs a new set of licensing and it\u2019s expensive to get.  He could earn a lot more with it, though, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s applying for this loan.   He belongs to the Chila community bank and this is his first MFP loan.  He was pleased to learn about this means of financing because the money will allow him to grow his business.  He, in turn, agrees to repay the loan in the agreed-upon time.  He likes his community bank because the members are responsible and supportive.  Carlos, upon receiving your loan, will pay for the licensing he needs to grow his taxi business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":992988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to get required licensing for his taxi business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-29T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-28T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401007}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T02:00:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":386291,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is a 45-year-old lady from Kisumu City, situated along the shores of Lake Victoria.

Sonia Margarita is 33 years old and lives in her own house with her husband and their three children aged 14, 9, and 5, two of whom attend school. For more than ten years Sonia has run a wholesale business selling a variety of seafood in the port near to her home. She sells shrimps, fish, conch etc. As she has had this business for several years, she has lots of experience. She has been able to earn the trust of her neighbours who now regularly buy from her.\r\n\r\nSonia is dedicated to her work and her goal is to provide the best service possible to her customers as the money she earns from it is her sole source of income. She expects it to remain so for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nThe needs of her family grow day by day, and often her income does not cover these costs. For this reason Sonia has decided to sell a greater variety of seafood.

She cares for them in her own house in the town of Hualahoyo.  She takes on problems in a wise way, because although she does not have a factory to make bricks this was not an obstacle for her because she decided to rent one and begin making bricks with her husband's help.  They are just beginning to make 10,000 per month and hope to increase production over time once they gain experience and working capital.  She knows she will reach her goal because sales to visiting merchants are successful every month.\r\n\r\nAlso, she has farmland where she grows alfalfa.  She rents the land to livestock farmers who need feed for their animals.  Now she wants to buy land for brick making instead of renting.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Barrio Oriental\" and this is her eighth loan through MFP.  She is happy with the financial support and is confident she can get ahead in her work.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time.  She enjoys being a part of the association because all the members are responsible and supportive.

She is a kind, good woman.  She lives with her partner David, who is 30 years old, and together they have a three-year-old son who is the reason they work so much: to offer him a better quality of life.  Kathya's work consists of selling drinks.  As such, the delivery truck comes to her stand daily to find out how many cases or packs of drinks she wants to sell throughout the day.  Like all business people, she orders the essential so that her investment won't be held up for a long time.  Thus, since she started two years ago up until today, she does this for a living.  She also likes the work because it has made her an independent woman and it contributes to her home finances.  She remembers that when she started on her own she would only sell a couple of cases and now she stocks a variety of flavors and sizes of drinks.

She has been running these businesses for twenty years. She has been working by herself this whole time and is now accustomed to working that way. She really likes what she does, as it provides her time to to care for her household and take care of some tasks that she needs to attend to while running her businesses. At the beginning, she had many difficulties learning everything related to the business. Moreover, she was lacking capital to invest in her business. With time, she was able to teach herself and kept learning. Because of this, now it is going much better and she can follow her dreams of growing and expanding her workshop. This will be her twelfth loan with MFP. Norma is very happy to know that all these years she could work with very responsible people and they didn't allow her to fall by the wayside.

He has moved his family ahead with a business selling party decorations such as pi\u00f1atas and ceramic items, as well as cards and accessories. \r\n\r\nWhen Luis left his job in a granary, he decided to start his own business in order to be able to improve his family\u2019s well-being. Drawing on his wife\u2019s experience with this kind of business, he found a shop, invested in pi\u00f1atas and cards and began selling in a very commercial area. His business has gradually grown and he has specialized in everything pertaining to parties: cards, pi\u00f1atas, mementos in cardboard, styrofoam and especially cold porcelain.\r\n\r\nCurrently his dream of increasing his working capital is growing because his customer base is expanding daily. That is why he came to KIVA for a loan, which he will use to buy ceramic and cardboard items, as well as pi\u00f1atas, in greater volume in order to lower his sales price and increase his working capital. His greatest challenge was when he acquired private loans, which were very onerous and did not allow him to get ahead. But that is in the past and now, with his and his wife\u2019s dedication, work discipline and sense of responsibility, he wants to expand his business in order to increase his children\u2019s well-being so they can grow and have a successful future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":992878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Party Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy ceramic and cardboard items, as well as pi\u00f1atas, in greater quantities so that he can lower his sales price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T04:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T04:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Eduardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":70804},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":79946},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81812},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83721},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85674},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87673},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89719},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91812},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":93955},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96147},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":98390},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":110347}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.31},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.7,"local_amount":70804,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71942.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039191},{"amount":44.83,"local_amount":79946,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":81231.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651322},{"amount":45.88,"local_amount":81812,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":83127.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140929},{"amount":46.94,"local_amount":83721,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":85066.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100823},{"amount":48.05,"local_amount":85674,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":87051.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338448},{"amount":149.84,"local_amount":267217,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":271512.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347070879},{"amount":224.76,"local_amount":400826,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-19T08:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":407269.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364527979}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T21:23:15Z","paid_date":"2013-05-19T08:45:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":384997,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio se sigue dedicando al negocio de ganaderia,el socio los ganados los hace engordar y crecer y luego los vende en las diferentes ferias que existe en el distrito de Anta y tambien el socio sigue siendo alba\u00f1il,el socio pinta y hace refacciones de casas,el sue\u00f1o del socio es ampliar el negocio de ganaderia.El  socio solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar alimentos para los ganados y tambien para comprar herramientas como pinturas y yeso.\n El socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.\n","en":"This member continues in the livestock business.

She lives with Justo, who is 47 years old, with whom she has three children: Iv\u00e1n who is 14 years old, Ximena who is 10 years old and 6 month old Saori, she is the youngest. Together they live in their own home and everyday she works to offer a better quality of life to their children. Sulejka has very good tastes when it comes to clothing. Since she was little, she has liked to make doll dresses and dress her younger siblings. Over time, she realized that sewing was her passion and she decided to install a workshop in her house where she could attend to her customers, make new designs and mend clothing. She has been working in this industry for 5 years and expresses that when she started, she worked for other people and had many difficulties. Her income was minimal and did not help to pay the household expenses. Over time, she decided that it was the right moment to start her own business and she started to work independently. Now, everything is going much better for her now that she has better income and she wishes to continue growing her business. \r\n\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she will have financial support, because in this way she will feel more secure in growing her business. On the other hand, she commits once more to fulfill her loan payments on time as she did with her previous loans. She is very happy to belong to a communal bank. All of the members are very nice and support each other. With the loan, she will buy materials and tools that she doesn't have, such as scissors and fabrics to continue her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":993795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase fabric, scissors and other sewing materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T05:30:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sulejka ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":264.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":287.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":297.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":299.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":320.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":330.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":99.36,"local_amount":264.96,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":267.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246330},{"amount":107.64,"local_amount":287.05,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":289.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386392},{"amount":111.66,"local_amount":297.75,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":300.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099486},{"amount":112.44,"local_amount":299.83,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":302.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713632},{"amount":120.01,"local_amount":320.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":322.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202519},{"amount":123.89,"local_amount":330.37,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":333.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098204}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T23:24:37Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Burns","image":972677}},{"id":386652,"name":"Mawou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mawou is 20 years old and lives in Jacob Town.

She lives with her husband Andr\u00e9s, they have been together for some 45 years. They have 8 children but only 2 live with them in their home which is located in the Cullpa Baja. Mar\u00eda lives with her children since she has ample space where each can live independently and she doesn\u2019t feel so alone. Mar\u00eda\u2019s main work is her small grocery store that she opened 21 years ago and throughout all this time she has stocked it very well since she has a steady customer base. She also has 4 cows, a bull, chickens and cuyes (a rodent like animal) that she sells or eats according to her needs. Since Mar\u00eda never rests, during the harvest season she grows corn and barley but she grows alfalfa constantly to feed her animals. The crops are sold to a wholesaler that visits her regularly since he knows the quality of her land, since it is left to rest for a year preparing it for another harvest.

She is an admirable woman since she takes care of her children by herself and devises ways to make money since her only source of income is raising pigs, she has 15. Julia fattens them up and cares for them with a lot of devotion since she sells their meat by orders and sometimes sells them alive \u201cit all depends on the customer,\u201d she says.

She lives with two of her four children, Jarol and Julissa, whom she cares for in her own home, which is located in the district of Chilca.  Her smile is proof of her vitality.  She grows produce such as potatoes, ulluco, and broad beans for a living, but because she wants to have quality produce, she constantly cares for, fertilizes, and protects them.  She is thankful for farming, as it allows her to take care of her children and offer them their daily meals.  But because her earnings are not stable, she decided to make an incursion into sewing, where she makes articles of clothing of all sizes and qualities.  She tells us that she earns an average of 150 nuevos soles per week, but during Christmas, New Year's, and the Santiago's agricultural festivities she earns more money.  She has 20 years of experience traveling to fairs in different cities, as the aprons that she sews with lot of dedication are what sell the best.

He thus joined Soro Yiriwaso this year with a view to being able to satisfy his ever-increasing customer demand more easily. Birama is requesting this loan to buy: 50 size 8 iron bars, 40 size 6 iron bars and 30 planks. He gets his supplies in Sikasso and Bamako. He generally sells to order.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he is expecting to make a monthly profit of 125,000FCFA. With the profits he makes, he is planning to cover the majority of his expenses, as well as those of his family, and pay the interest on his loan; the rest will be reinvested in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":996039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Niena","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T10:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T10:30:04Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Birama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":92033.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757101},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":92033.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410864},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":92033.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502753},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":92033.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498845},{"amount":185,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":92033.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243171}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T08:45:47Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":386852,"name":"Fatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"L'emprunteuse est une femme mari\u00e9e qui exerce dans le commerce de tissus.

She is married, and has 4 children age 16, 13, 11 and 4 years old.  She has 3 additional dependents who live with her because they are all in school.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Hawa established her food stuff business.  She began her business just to assist her mother and to enhance her independence.  Working 6 days a week and 9 hours a day, she earns about SLL 950,000 every month from this business.  She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 4,000,000. \r\n\r\nHawa has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy bulgur, beans and pepper.

Many people prefer his store because he always has the basic staples at accessible prices, and he provides the best possible customer service. His dream is to see his store flourish.\r\n\r\nDue to the current bad situation in Yemen, he has less profit from his enterprise. So, he took a loan of 100,000 YER to stock his business with more products so that his customers will always find what they need and keep coming back.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Khalid would like to study for a Master's degree in his field of specialization and hopes to be able to get his family ahead and give them better opportunities in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":995624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery goods which will increase his profit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Ibb","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T14:30:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khalid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":16685},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16663},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16663},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16663},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16663},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16663}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.25,"local_amount":16685,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":16896.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269957061},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16663,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":16874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563338},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16663,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":16874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050483},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16663,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":16874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072024},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16663,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":16874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266895},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":16663,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":16874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320233}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T22:12:20Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":386836,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe is 44 years old and is married and a good mother of six children.

Daniel is looking for a loan to help him build a website, purchase a VOIP calling system to handle the large amount of calls they receive per month, and to purchase a quick charger (which reduces the vehicle charging time). \r\n\r\nThis business loan will be crucial for Daniel in order to continue running this practical and creative business that has been so beneficial for the tourism of Miami.

She enjoys a good reputation and gets a lot of orders. It is thus with a view to satisfying this ever-growing customer demand that she joined Soro Yiriwaso three years ago. All her previous loans have been repaid in full. \r\n\r\nWith her new loan she is planning to buy: 30 sacks of millet, 100 sacks of corn and 5 sacks of sorghum. She gets her supplies in the villages of Finkolo Ganadougou, Farakala and Niena. The cereals she buys are stocked in her shop in Niena and she sells them wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she is expecting to make a monthly profit of 120,000FCFA. With these profits, she is planning to cover her family expenses and pay the interest on her loan; the rest will be invested in her activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":996049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Niena","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":101982.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757103},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":101982.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410866},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101982.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502755},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":101982.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498847},{"amount":205,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101982.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243173}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T19:28:06Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":386061,"name":"Elsy Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elsy, vive con su esposo y tres hijos de 15, 18 y 21 a\u00f1os de edad, ella administra un comedor y tienda, la venta la realiza todos los d\u00edas de 5:00am hasta que termina, este negocio lo tiene en el hospital nacional de la localidad, ah\u00ed mismo esta la tienda de productos comestibles.\nActualmente est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de tubos, laminas, que ser\u00e1n utilizados para reparar el techo del negocio, con este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 realizar la inversi\u00f3n y darle mantenimiento al negocio. \nSu objetivo con el pr\u00e9stamo es poder mejorar el techo del negocio, haci\u00e9ndolo m\u00e1s seguro, tambien para el futuro quiere comprarse un terreno donde construir su propia casa. \n","en":"Elsy lives with her husband and three children, ages 15, 18, and 21.

His business was located in the middle of town and he is looking to increase the range of products he offers to his customers so that it becomes more pleasant for them to eat and drink in his business, but when the revolution came up between government and citizens, people immigrated to their villages,  and his clients became less.\n\nSo, he took out a youth loan of 100,000 YER from AMB in order to purchase more products such as tables, chairs, foods and soft drinks for his business. In the future, he plans to expand his business and offer better services for his clients so that he can improve his living conditions.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":995274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase more tables, chairs, foods and soft drinks for his business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sameer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12507},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12499},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12499}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.41,"local_amount":12507,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":12665.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269957058},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563335},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050480},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072021},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266892},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320230},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341166},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":12499,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":12657.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310525}],"funded_date":"2012-01-30T21:59:38Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":384948,"name":"Al Ouma Lib 4,5 Groupe 2","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Al  OUMA libert\u00e94, 5 groupe 2 est un sous groupe qui est compos\u00e9  de 13 membres qui adh\u00e8rent tous dans la meme association  lequel est un groupement national de solidarit\u00e9.

She started the business three years ago; her daughter taught her how and gave her money to buy shoes to fill her first orders.  Her business is itinerant.  She goes out to neighborhoods in her community to offer her products.  Her business is important because she earns profits and keeps her occupied.

She lives with 43-year old Edgardo who has been her partner for a long time. They have two children, Edgardo aged 14 and Rubi aged 5. They live in their own house. \r\n\r\nLupita works hard every day to provide her family with a better quality of life. She goes to the houses of her friends, neighbours, and relatives to show them the different items of clothing she has for sale. When her customers have won her trust, she lets them buy the items on credit. They make the repayments either daily, weekly, or in some cases every two weeks. Lupita has been doing this work for seven years; she works alone as there is no need for another person to help her.\r\n\r\nShe really enjoys the work as it allows her enough time to be able to work in a state institution where she has a very important role. Selling clothing provides additional income so she can provide a better standard of living for her family.\r\n\r\nLudmila wishes to continue this work but her goal is to have a shop or small business from which to sell her products. This will be her 15th loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that this financial assistance is available to enable her to expand her business. She is positive that she will continue to be a good and responsible member as she has been with her past loans. She enjoys being part of the community bank as all the members are responsible, committed people. With the S\/. 1,000 loan, she will buy clothing and other merchandise so she can continue offering new designs and styles to her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":994728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing and accessories to sell to her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-30T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-02-29T16:30:05Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lupita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":148.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":159.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":166.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":177.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.61,"local_amount":148.3,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":149.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246333},{"amount":59.72,"local_amount":159.25,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":160.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386402},{"amount":61.95,"local_amount":165.2,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":166.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099498},{"amount":62.38,"local_amount":166.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713644},{"amount":66.59,"local_amount":177.56,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":179.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202531},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":185.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098216}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T01:03:52Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":386868,"name":"Yassah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yassah is 38 years old and lives in the town of Barnesville.

In search of an income source for her family, Mamlakatkhon started her own business in animal husbandry in 2004 with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS), which now yields a stable income from the sales of milk and meat products.  She is also involved in preparing and selling dried fruits and today has a ready inventory of nuts, valued at 70,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from this business allowed Mamlakatkhon to repay her youngest daughter's university education.  In order to further develop her business, Mamlakatkhon requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase livestock.  In the future, she wants to increase her farm and expand her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":995253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Her husband is Pepito, a security guard. She is a mother to her four children. She, together with her husband, manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nMarigrace operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippines Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 16,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarigrace hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.
