He travels to San Juan Nepomuceno and brings the beautiful back packs, traditionally woven by the women there, to Cartagena where he sells them to a fixed customer base. His customers buy from him on credit and many times on an installment plan.\r\n\r\nCarlos\u2019 business started due to a visit to a relative who is a native of San Jacinto [9 miles from San Juan Nepomuceno] where he was struck by the beauty of the handicrafts and by the business opportunities in the city of Cartagena where he lives with his family, consisting of his wife and his two children, aged 9 and 13. A relative helped him make his first contact with suppliers while he started promotions in order to build up his first clientele. \r\n\r\nHis customers have been growing and increasing his need for more working capital in order to respond to them. This is exactly why he has come to Kiva for a loan, his first funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. He will use it to buy bags for all occasions, an investment that he projects will be successful because he will use the money to fill his customers\u2019 orders. His goal is to expand his business infrastructure and have his own shop in the future. However, his challenge is the lack of working capital to do so.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":994888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags for all occasions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-31T00:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-01T00:30:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82944},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91879},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94023},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96217},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98462},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100759},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103110},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105516},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":107978},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":119112}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.62},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.69,"local_amount":82944,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85680.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039197},{"amount":52.83,"local_amount":91879,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":94909.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651328},{"amount":54.07,"local_amount":94023,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":97124.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140935},{"amount":55.32,"local_amount":96217,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":99390.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100828},{"amount":56.62,"local_amount":98462,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":101710.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338453},{"amount":57.93,"local_amount":100759,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104082.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395023},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":103110,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:09Z","rounded_local_amount":106511.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774844},{"amount":60.67,"local_amount":105516,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":108996.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386836},{"amount":130.58,"local_amount":227090,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:07Z","rounded_local_amount":234581.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993716}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T04:59:38Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":386562,"name":"Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Nueva Generaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 formado por 6 socias y 1 socio quienes viven en diferentes lugares de la ciudad de Cuenca conocida como la \"Atenas del Ecuador\", la ciudad cultural del pa\u00eds, es Patrimonio Cultural de la Humanidad desde Diciembre de 1999.

She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, sugar; primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her husband\u2019s foam-selling business is also a big help. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more grocery items which will enable her to have more stock. The more items displayed at the store the better, as it helps to attract more customers to buy in her variety store. More sales will result in better profit. It will help her to save some money for any unexpected expenses.  \r\n\r\nMerly hopes that her business will continue to grow. She hopes that she will be able to send all her children to private school once they are old enough to study. She wants them to enjoy a good life.

She loves her children--3- and 2-years old, respectively--and, at their young age, they still very much need their mother.  They live in Ica, a city known for having a mild climate, no matter the season.  Agriculture is a major employer here and local farmers export their crops to all parts of the world.  Grapes, asparagus and butter beans are especially common crops.  The area is also famous for Peru\u2019s flagship drink, \u201cpisco\u201d.   Peru is famous for its cuisine and one of Eusebia\u2019s favorite dishes is \u201carroz con pollo\u201d.  \r\n\r\nEusebia says that she would have liked to study accounting, but she had to leave school early because her parents couldn\u2019t afford her school fees.  Even so, she has managed to build her own business, selling computer and internet services.  She works 15 hours a day and sees up to 80 customers a day.  She gets up very early to do housework so that she can put in a full day at her store.

She works as an accountant at the Village Association of water users and, as an additional source of income for her family, runs an animal husbandry business.  Having started in 2004 with an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS), Damira was able to develop her business to yield 8,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of milk and dairy products.

Her family's primary source of income is animal husbandry.  Having started with a purchase of five sheep, Sonaiym was able to develop her business to yield a monthly profit of 4,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from this business allowed Sonaiym to buy a house for her family in her village.  In order to further develop her business, Sonaiym requested a loan in the sum of 130,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy sheep for fattening up and resale.  She plans to invest the profits into increasing livestock headcount further and, in the future, dreams to see her children as university students.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":997111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Gulcha village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-31T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-01T16:20:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonaiym","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2013-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1076.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1723.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1076.92,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50347.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070981},{"amount":1723.08,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80555.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495260}],"funded_date":"2012-01-31T21:53:27Z","paid_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":384067,"name":"Mango Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bakari is in his late forties.

She has been working as a nurse for a long time and now is retired. Meylikan is engaged in animal husbandry and crop-farming which are a source of income for her family. The animal husbandry business was set up back in the Soviet times with 100 Soviet roubles, and currently brings in about 7,000 som (KGS) per day from the sale of milk. As of today, Meylikan's farm counts two dairy cows, one horse and ten sheep.\r\nIn order to further develop her business, Meylikan sought help from Bai Tushum & Partners and asked for a loan in the amount of 30,000 som (KGS) to purchase one heifer. Meylikan is planning on investing her earnings from the loan in planting 3.5 ha of beans, and in the future she wants to increase the livestock population.

Her husband enjoys playing video games, so she bought the gaming equipment and every afternoon the children gathered at her house to play.  They began forming a line, so she started renting out the games.  Over time, more of her neighbors began visiting, so she was able to save some money to invest.

daughters who are 9 months old and 3 years old.  She is very happy.  She comments that they are the best gift God could have given her.  She lives in the city of Mala, a city with extensive, first quality agricultural fields which are complemented by irrigation systems where irrigation canals stand out and that are enormously productive agriculturally.\r\n\r\nIn her free time, Lisa enjoys playing with her daughters because that relaxes her and above all because it brings her closer to them.  Like all good Peruvians, Lisa loves our food and one of her favorite dishes is the very delicious \u201cEstofado de Pollo.\u201d  Lisa was only able to study up to fifth grade of secondary school because her parents\u2019 lacked economic means but she would have liked to have studied to become a cosmetologist.\r\n\r\nLisa has a restaurant that she spends about 9 hours daily in and can take care of up to 30 customers per day.  She believes that she does well in her business because she makes tasty dishes and because her daughters give her strength to work and work well; they cause her to be more driven to work harder each day.\r\n\r\nLisa is very thankful to Kiva lenders because thanks to their support she will be able to buy a photocopier because across from her business there\u2019s a daycare center and since the school term is about to start they always need to make copies and this will mean extra income for her so that she can continue saving up to reach her greatest dream: \u201cTo study a professional career and that her daughters become professionals.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":996342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a photocopier.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-31T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-01T22:30:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lisa Bonet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":132.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":142.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":143.32},{"due_date":"2012-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":151.07},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":155.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":167.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":174.29},{"due_date":"2012-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.23},{"due_date":"2012-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":188.46},{"due_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":196.46},{"due_date":"2013-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":203.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.65},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.67},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.67,"local_amount":175.11,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":176.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271265},{"amount":37.44,"local_amount":99.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993918},{"amount":110.39,"local_amount":294.39,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":296.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090939},{"amount":34.94,"local_amount":93.18,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":93.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287222016},{"amount":84.25,"local_amount":224.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":226.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301350866},{"amount":417.31,"local_amount":1112.81,"processed_date":"2013-03-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1122.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347031903}],"funded_date":"2012-02-01T01:32:52Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T11:36:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":387073,"name":"Alicia Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alicia es una mujer que no se amilana ante nada, es madre y su hijo tiene15 a\u00f1os, el cual cursa el cuarto a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n secundaria;

She sells a variety of merchandise, especially footwear, bags and clothing. In addition, she sells fast food in the doorway of her house. Two years ago she also began selling repair parts, washing machines and refrigerators.  Experience has taught her to accommodate her customers\u2019 requests: in order to identify her lines of merchandise she keeps an eye on the things they request that she does not have in stock, and, making a note of them, she buys these items and in this way constructs her own marketplace. She operates her merchandise business every day, offering either credit or an installment plan, while she sells fast food, such as hamburgers, skewered meat and other treats on weekends in order to earn additional income quickly and energize both businesses.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is getting ready for the coming Carnival season when people are happy and spend money lavishly, a situation she capitalizes on to make her best sales. Nevertheless a large part of her working capital is in the hands of her customers who bought on credit so that she does not have enough available to adequately respond to the demand. Consequently she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for a Kiva loan. She will use it to buy clothing, footwear and supplies for her food business, an investment that will be successful because she responds to demand and the more she sells the greater her earnings and profit. \r\n\r\nHer goal is for her business to prosper and her greatest desire is that her family will always remain united\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":994896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

He is married to a businesswoman and has two children aged 10 and 4 years old. In 1990, Prince established his essential drugs business. He began his business because after finishing high school, he joined his family in business in Kono. Since then, he decided not to further his studies and within years, he proved to be a good businessman. Unfortunately, the war broke out and rebels entered Kono. He ran to Makeni with nothing in his pocket. There he started working for friends until he raised some funds to start his own business fresh.  Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 2,985,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000 . Prince has already received and successfully repaid one loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy panadol - 2 cartons @ Le540,000, eat fine syrup - 2 cartons @ Le500,000, hunger up syrup - 3 cartons @ Le300,000, relief pain tabs - 2 cartons @ Le700,000, and solotone - 2 cartons @ Le310,000. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 497,000 . In the future, Prince plans to open an advance pharmacy.  \n\nHe feels good because it is helping organize him. He wants to see his children have a good education.

He serves about 60 people per day.  His store is licensed and he does not sell illegal drugs. He treats his customers with respect and patience.  His suppliers are located in Freetown where he goes once per week and in Conakry twice a month to buy in large quantity.  He usually goes by public vehicle.  He uses his profit to develop his unfinished building and the rest as an addition to his capital.  A rise in the cost of goods affects him greatly because as cost prices change, he has to change his selling price as it affect his customer buying pattern. He offers quality products. \n\nHe serves people around the city, at least 60 people per day, His business is popular as he treats his customers with respect and fairly   He is assisted by family members.

She has been married for 18 years to Rogelio, who works doing masonry projects. They have one child in the third year of secondary school and two little ones who are not in school yet. \r\n\r\nPatricia is a very hard-working person who works at embroidery and weaving in her spare time. However, her main economic activity is buying and selling chickens, which she fattens for sale. She has 2 years of experience with this work. She buys the chickens from dealers who come through her village offering them, or more often she goes to the commercial centers of her town to buy them there. She then takes them to her house where she carefully raises them. She prepares them a little pen or chicken coop, which is arranged so they can eat, sleep and grow there. Patricia gives them water and food in their coop, and she makes sure that they have everything they need. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Patricia is requesting this loan to buy 10 young chickens and chicken feed. She has been a client of FRAC for 5 loan cycles already, and she has found herself benefited by the loans in a radical way, since each time she has invested them well and has always paid them off punctually. When she sells her chickens, she does so from her house. \r\n\r\nPatricia is a woman who is also a dreamer, and in the future she would like to buy more than 100 chickens, set up a chicken farm and sell them.

She\u2019s a young woman who\u2019s been with her life\u2019s partner for two years.  Each day they awake, determined to work persistently in order to achieve a better future so that her son can be successful.\r\n\r\nSalma began gaining experience, making foam decorations, when she was a young girl and has had a workshop for three years.  She makes crafts for shops and other businesses in the city center.

Diana Lizet is 24 years-old and lives in a common law marriage with her husband. They have two boys and one is in elementary school and the other is in preschool. She sells catalog underwear and asked for the loan to buy bras, blouses, pajamas, panties, and bikinis. She began her business four years ago by means of an invitation from her aunt. Her husband supplied her to buy her first orders. Her business is important because it gives her earnings for her children and she is proud to be able to buy things for her home herself.
