She is married to an industrious farmer in their village. Rice farming is the family's primary source of income. They have been planting and harvesting rice since they got married 15 years ago.

Though she suffers from hardships and shortages in financial matters; still, she endures it because her main goal is to let her children finish their degree courses.

She is thankful because her vegetables sell out immediately but during the lean months, she struggles to sell them. Nowadays, she aims to buy more vegetables such as cabbage, string beans and eggplant for her vegetable vending business. To make her aims come true, she is asking for additional capital of PHP 10,000. She believes that through her patience and additional capital, she can obtain income.

She is married and has three dependent sons. All of her sons are still in school. To earn a living, she has been farming rice as her primary source of income for 16 years and she supplements her income by running a small grocery store in the front yard of her house. \n\nEy received her first loan from Kiva's partner, VisionFund, in 2009 and she completely repaid it. The loan has helped her to run her grocery store successfully and to send her sons to school regularly. Currently, she earns more than US$5 per day and is able to save around US$4 per day for her family. Now Ey and her group member Em are applying for another loan from VisionFund for KHR1,400,000 each. As the leader, she plans to use the entire loan to buy piglets for her new business.

Like other villagers, Thea is also a rice farmer who has been farming her own farmland as a primary business for 15 years while her husband is a house builder in the area.\r\n\r\nThea has joined with VisionFund since 2008. The previous loans have helped her grow her rice timely and successfully and send her children to school regularly. With her current income of nine U.S. dollars per day, she is able to save three U.S. dollars daily for future needs. Successfully repaying her last loan with VisionFund, she leads a group consisting of three female members in applying for another loan with VisionFund for US$350 each. As the leader, she will use this loan to buy fertilizer and rice seeds for her farmland. She hopes to increase her crop yield and improve her lifestyle and keep her children in school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":979044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and rice seeds for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Moung Russey district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:41Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nhem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rum","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2400000},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":302250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294468331},{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T12:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":503750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301522064},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1600000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1612000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308288360},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":604500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315518888},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T17:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":604500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323118409},{"amount":150,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T16:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":604500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331265395}],"funded_date":"2012-02-02T21:32:28Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T16:15:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":379806,"name":"Koboyodou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Koboyodou est une femme  \u00e2g\u00e9(e) de 41 ans.

She sells wool in order to afford the living expenses of her family. Wool is used in making sweaters and other winter clothes. She has given birth to 2 sons. Both of them work and contribute to the family financially.\r\n\r\nFarzana has applied for a loan from KIVA partner Asasah for her wool-selling business. With the loan investment, she will buy wool in bulk quantities, which will allow her to sell in larger quantities and increase her sales and profits.\r\n\r\nThe winter season is here, and the demand for wool is high. Farzana is hopeful that by investing the loan she will be able to increase her income.\r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady holding a book (called the Asasah Passbook) is Farzana.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":984776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking
