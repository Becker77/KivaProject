She has lived in the city for the past eight years. She took out a clean-fuel loan to help her save money and to reduce air pollution in the city. Davaa said that the fuel \u201chas many advantages, including the need to use less of it than regular fuel and that keeps us warmer. It is an especially nice opportunity for people who have a low income to purchase the fuel through a loan. By using this cleaner fuel, we use less fuel. For example, we previously had to burn extra fuel at night, but now we don\u2019t need to do that because the new fuel burns longer.\u201d \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank Eco Products Program\r\n\r\nUlaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city's population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt.

For more than six years she has been growing potatoes, corn, as well as vegetables such as onions and lettuce on her own land.  Each morning, she and her husband go to the fields to care for their crops and protect them from pests and occasional weather changes that can hurt production.  In addition, Maritza raises guinea pigs and chickens on her farm and sells them each week to earn extra income.  She enjoys her work tremendously because it allows her to be in the country and appreciate the beautiful landscape that surrounds her community.  In addition, she is rewarded when her crops are sold.

Anorbegim hopes to continue to develop her business by opening several more pharmaceutical kiosks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live together in their own house located in the community of Palmapampa in the district of Samugari. Ra\u00fal is a young man with many hopes and goals. It is for this reason that when he got engaged to Hortensia, Ra\u00fal's parents gave him 2 hectares of land.

He mentioned that harvest time is when he is happiest since he produces in quantity and this gives him greater profitability when it is sold to the businesses. The thing he considers most difficult is transferring the products from where they are harvested to where they are dried. Now his biggest priority is to put together more capital to buy new land and plant new plants. This is his first loan with MFP and he feels that this investment will help him greatly progressing his work. He is grateful to the communal bank for having confidence in him and allowing him to work together with the rest of the members.

He is 43 years old. Leonilo is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Leonilo owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Leonilo has been engaged in his business for over 21 years and earns approximately 12745 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leonilo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used  to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Leonilo is requesting a new loan of 40000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. It will also help him to finance for farm maintenance. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Leonilo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She also cares for many relatives that live with her. For the last five years, she has been operating a food stall from her home in Empangeni, South Africa. She sells cakes, chips, and sausages to her neighbors. She also receives money from the South African government to support her children.\r\n\r\nBonhiwe requested a loan through WDB and Kiva to buy ingredients that she will use to make food.

Nessy expects to earn about 200 USD from increased sales after getting this loan. In the future she hopes to increase the quantity and range of the business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":192690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of traditional African cloth in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:20:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nessy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:17:20Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356219},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347972},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970546},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886763},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436023}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:17:20Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65529,"name":"Zuhuru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zuhuru M., age 45, is married with 4 children.

Since a big part of her working capital is represented in the cover charges, she is looking for financing so that she can respond to each new customer that her most profitable customers refer to her. And also to earn a discount on promotions for large volume and cash purchases. In this way, she will improve her usefulness, keeping in mind that currently her profitability is 15.5%, and buying with cash will save her money to attain opportunities on better offers, more customers, and better usefulness. This is her first loan with \"la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\", and with this Kiva loan she will buy seasonal footwear for the end of the year. She knows the great commercial movement of this product very well, which will increase her sales. These days, she gets more referred customers that don't have cash to make a purchase, because of the family costs of the end of the year.

Muzafar has been baking traditional bread since a young age. He inherited this skill from his father and grandfather. His working day starts at 4 a.m. when he and his assistants begin to knead dough, form the bread, and heat the stove. At the beginning, Muzafar kneads dough from two sacks of flour of 50 kg. each. The winter is an important period for his business, as there are many holidays this season. He needs to have a stock of flours and coal. For this reason Muzafar applied to IMON International for a loan of 8,200 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her husband is Rodrigo, her business partner, and a father to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nEditha operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

This is 35-year-old Selina A D., who is divorced with two children aged 8 and 14. Selina has been running  a beauty salon business since 2003, a place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.  It is quite a thing to be seen!\r\n\r\nSelina works at her business ten hours a day, seven days a week, earning a monthly profit of approximately $200.  She is now requesting a loan of $775 in order to purchase an additional hair dryer, chairs, hair products such as wigs, and other cosmetics.  Due to the success of this business, she hopes to open another in the future, and she thanks you in advance for your support.\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":248902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

The main source of income for the business comes from selling specialty food products such as viands in the local community.  Imelda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Imelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI to purchase raw ingredients needed to make viands for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nImelda is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP to repair her food stall used in the business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Catherine a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9, un cr\u00e9dit qu\u2019elle a bien rembours\u00e9. Actuellement, Catherine ne dispose pas assez de fonds pouvant lui permettre de satisfaire le grand nombre de clients et de se faire plus de revenus \u00e0 la hauteur de ses diff\u00e9rentes charges. C\u2019est donc pour renforcer son activit\u00e9 que Catherine sollicite un deuxi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit.","en":"Born on March 24, 1977 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, Ms. B.

She is married to Mr. SINDEHOU Pinus and is the mother of three children, who are all in school.  The family lives together in PK 10.  She joins her husband in ensuring that family expenses are covered.\r\n\r\nCatherine attended primary school only.  For ten years, she has had a business selling porridge (made from corn and sugar) served with <i>p\u00e2t\u00e9s<\/i> (made from wheat flour and oil).

She lives in Dushanbe and owns a small vending store in the local market. For about two years Sharofat has been selling the national coat \u201cChapan\u201d for men and national dresses for women. Her store is well-known in the market for having a nice variety of assorted merchandise at affordable prices, and her profits have increased considerably since she started her business. Sharofat has a unique ability to analyze a merchandise market and find her niche, a skill that helped her start her business and make it successful. Today, in order to increase inventory and sales, she is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni. With your help this will be possible. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Chu Th\u1ecb is a 33-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To making a living, H. owns and operates a specialized retail store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling flowers in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7.392.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand the business.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 9.632.000 VND that will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture, a general store business. Her husband Gregorio D., who is 55 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have six children who are between 15 and 33 years old. \r\n\r\nVicenta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vicenta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future for student allowance and for family needs. \r\n\r\nVicenta D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a single mother of 3 children who all go to school. Maria started higher level studies but left without completing them due to other time pressures. She lives in her own home with her family and she does not support anyone else.\r\nShe left her home town and came to Maputo in search of work. She has been a teacher for 16 years at the salt works' full primary school; she earns a monthly salary of 13,133.29MTs which covers her household expenses and leaves a little for her to save in her Millennium BIM bank account. \r\nShe has previously borrowed 30,000MTs from the Millennium BIM bank to start her project. She repaid this with ease. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a Hluvuku client. This is her third loan with this institution, for 20,000MTs, which Maria will use to buy building materials for her house (sand, beams, cement, iron, stone and other materials) in order to carry on with the work. Her previous loans were for 8,300MTs, 10,000MTs and 15,000MTs.\r\nMaria wants to finish building her house and furnish it so that her family will be comfortable. She intends to apply for further Hluvuku loans for this purpose. \r\n

She has owned a store in the La Pradera neighborhood for a little more than three years. \r\n\r\nHer business is located in her parent's house. She has all the infrastructure necessary for operating this kind of business well; and competition in this part of the city is declining.  She has a very good sales volume and a varied, high quality selection.  She has adequate inventories, and manages her accounts payable cautiously. The profit margin of her business allows her to have a good ability to pay. Turnover of both accounts payable and inventory is rapid.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for her first Credikiva loan, in order to stock her convenience store with products for the end of year season.

He is married and has two children. They live in Saranay where he manages their corn field. He had been in his farm for ten years.

Since she was young, Zonia has had to work because her parents did not have much income and therefore she only finished middle school, although she would have loved to study to become a fashion designer. \r\n\r\nZonia is the mother of three children whom she loves very much, and she works very hard to provide for them and to give them the opportunities that she did not have.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Zonia works in her small tailoring and repairs business. She works for around 10 hours a day and serves around 20 customers a day. She believes that she is moving forward with her business because she is very kind to the customers and, above all, because she does a good job. \r\n\r\nZonia is very grateful to the Kiva lenders because thanks to their great help she will be able to buy supplies for her business like silk, zippers, tubes, thread, elastic among other items, and in this way she will have the necessary materials to increase her income. She will continue working hard day in day out to achieve her dream which is to own her own premises and to be able to give her children a good education. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1283935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"Para la compra de abono, fertilizantes, enter otros.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Aguaytia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rusvel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geraldine Pugh","image":null}},{"id":525593,"name":"Ameera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ameera is twenty eight years old , with two children, and lives in Beit Safafa in south Jerusalem.

However the production is not enough to fulfill her family's daily needs.  Her husband works as a furniture maker.  However he has not been making much money due to the downturn in business.  This motivated Nyoman to start a pig farm with DINARI's help.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was used ti purchase a piglet and feeds.  With DINARI's financial and technical help, Nyoman earned $260 after 6 months breeding to slaughter cycle.\r\n\r\nWith this result, Nyoman Bakti decided to seek second loan from DINARI.  This second loan will be used to purchase more piglets and feeds than before.  Nyoman hopes to reap more profit and help her family's finances more.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nBertani di kebun orang tuanya merupakan kesehari-harian Ni Nyoman Bakti. Tetapi dari hasil kebun tersebut tidak mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya. Suaminya yang berprofesi  sebagai tukang meubel juga tidak terlalu banyak membantu penghasilan keluarga karena sepinya order dan sulitnya mencari bahan baku meubel. Selanjutnya Nyoman berusaha beternak babi dengan meminjam ke DINARI. \r\nPinjaman tersebut kemudian dibelikan bibit babi dan pakannya untuk digemukkan. Dengan pendampingan dari DINARI, Nyoman berhasil memperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp. 2.400.000,- selama 6 bulan masa pemeliharaan. \r\nDengan hasil yang terlihat memuaskan tersebut, Nyoman Bakti memutuskan untuk kembali bekerja sama dengan DINARI untuk mendapatkan pinjaman kedua. Dari pinjaman kedua ini nantinya akan dibelikan bibit dan pakan babi yang lebih banyak dari pembelian dengan pinjaman pertama. Sehingga Nyoman berharap akan memperoleh keuntungan yang lebih baik lagi sehingga mampu mendongkrak perekonomian keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":172533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Piglets and Feeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman Bakti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-07T10:09:26Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":276879.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288527},{"amount":30,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T08:14:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-21T07:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":276879.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":321713},{"amount":56.67,"local_amount":453333.32,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":522994.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308492},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":466666.68,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":538376.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849718}],"funded_date":"2008-06-23T10:09:26Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":57362,"name":"Olga Maria","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Olga is a humble client of scarse resources who supports her three school-age children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business is called \"Bodega Yacky.\"  She still remembers that when she arrived in the area, there was no electricity or running water and there were very few houses.  Little by little the population grew, and with it the needs of the people.  She decided to open a small place in her house and began selling \"marcianos,\" or ice cream, and sodas.  Later she stocked up on other things that were requested until now she has a a larger store next to this and she has been able to save and build a house where she is projecting that she will put another store with a grocery mini-market.  She would also like to establish another business selling fruit.  Currently she is venturing into the sale of beer at wholesale for social events.  Irene is happy that thanks to the loans of EDAPROSPO she has been able to see her business grow.  With her previous loans she could buy a freezer, display case, and refrigerator - which have been indispensable for her business.  With this opportunity she will use her loan to buy beer and continue with the business that she began recently.  The group she is a part of is called \"Senor D. los Milagros\" or \"Lord of Miracles\" and she is happy to belong to the group.  \r\n*Going left to right, Mrs. Irene is the fourth woman of those standing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anna Ruby Waxham Blackwell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4225,"image":{"id":542178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of Beer for her Business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4225,"lender_count":139,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aquila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eufemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Irene Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Santa Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1056.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1056.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1056.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1056.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":2112.5,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6001.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617153},{"amount":1056.25,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831488},{"amount":1056.25,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098031}],"funded_date":"2010-06-30T08:45:32Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Ruby Waxham Blackwell","image":null}},{"id":205715,"name":"Mao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. S. presently resides with other family members in the capital, Phnom Pen.

She spent 35 years working as a primary grades teacher and is known as a very goal-oriented, responsible and hardworking person.  Jumabubu was able to pass her love of knowledge onto her children, who obtained higher education degrees in the fields of medicine, engineering and linguistics.  Obtaining education became possible thanks to Jumabubu's family's primary business, which is fattening up and reselling livestock.  This business, started in 1990 with an initial sum of 25,000 som (KGS), today yields about 15,000 som (KGS) per month.  Currently, Jumabubu's business has 4 dairy cows, 15 heads of sheep, and 9 heads of goats.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Jumabubu requested a loan in the sum of 133,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional livestock.  This will allow her to expand her business and increase livestock headcount; thus, in her opinion, making the best investment of capital.  In the future, Jumabubu wants to build a large house for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2850,"image":{"id":984986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Emgekchil village, Naryn region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2850,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":133000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":16000},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2014-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":19000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.72},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":407.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":342.86,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16041.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816199},{"amount":342.85,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":16041.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285470},{"amount":342.86,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":16041.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329660},{"amount":342.86,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16041.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459387},{"amount":342.86,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2013-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-17T09:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":16041.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364458598},{"amount":342.85,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T09:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":16041.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390495257},{"amount":792.86,"local_amount":37000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":37095.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776819}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T16:25:55Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":554433,"name":"Stephanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of three children, Stephanie works hard to support her family.\n\nShe has a fishing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling frozen foods.

She told us that she learned to cook professionally during an eight-year period in the office of a Cambodian senator.

On a good day she can serve up to 50 customers.<p>She currently prepares and sells basic noodle and soup dishes commonly referred to as \u201cKhmer Noodles\u201d.  She hopes to refine her shop and menu so she can sell a range of more complex and expensive fare referred to as \u201cChinese Noodles\u201d.  The main difference between these two styles of cooking comes from the expense of ingredients, the method of preparation, and formality of dining.

The earnings are better when she processes 2 pigs but she generally processes one due to lack of cash.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two children, for whom took out a loan to buy welding equipment so they could work.  She lives in the Maica Sud community in Cochabamba.  She has three cows, and uses their milk to make cheese, which she sells in the different markets in the city of Cochabamba as well as to the people who sell Charque (a traditional Cochababma dish,  eaten with cheese).  Delfina has been making cheese for more than thirty-two years.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she received through Kiva last year, Delfina was able to buy food (corn husks) for her milk cows.  Due to drought, prices increased significantly and she wasn't able to buy all the food her cows needed.  With the loan, she had no problem continuing to produce the same amount of milk and, accordingly, cheese.  Delfina hopes she'll be able to get this loan to buy a milk cow so she can increase milk production and with it her income.  She really appreciates the people who, through Kiva, have put their trust in her and given her the opportunity to better herself.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva

She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating a business. \n\nVivian operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Vivian earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 600 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \n\nVivian hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.

The Yiriwa group is involved in the breeding and the sale of livestock products (sale of live animals, butter, fresh milk, yogurt,  curdled milk, etc). This group of Peulh women (a semi-nomadic people of West Africa specialized in the breeding of cattle), bound through ethnic and linguistic but also family ties, decided to borrow together from the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. This is their first group loan. With this loan, they would like to build their supplies of cattle food and medication at the veterinary pharmacies in Fana, Marka coungo and Santiguila. They usually sell the livestock and products for cash on market days in these cities, and their business runs year round.

She has lived there since she started her local restaurant. Yaa's husband is very supportive and provides the basic needs of the family.   \r\n\r\nShe prepares and sells local foods like fufu, banku and other local dishes. Fufu is prepared from pounded cassava and plantain, and is eaten with all kinds of soup. Banku is prepared from milled maize grains and it is taken with hot pepper or soup. With her tasty meals she has attracted many customers in the area where she serves. Therefore it has become necessary to employ additional hands to assist her in food delivering service. That was when we visited her at her local restaurant. \r\n\r\nYaa says prices of raw materials have gone up significantly and she needs the assistnce of a loan to enable her meet her production expenses.

She is responsible for six people, and she lives from hand to mouth on the meager income generated by the business that she has run for the last 20 years. She uses the traditional system of buying fish on credit from the fishermen and paying them back after selling the fish. This is not a good deal for her and does not allow her to support her family.\r\n\r\nHer experience with tontines(a group savings\/investment system) and loans has, little by little, given her some financial independence. Her aim from now on is to pay for the fish with cash, increase her fish production and thus her income. She is therefore requesting a loan to buy the new ovens and grills she needs to make her business a success. The financing of this project will considerably reduce her family's poverty.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":274795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To sell smoked fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"An\u00e9ho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayaba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28096.14},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28517.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28945.35},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29379.53},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29820.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30267.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":30721.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31182.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31650.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":32124.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":32606.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33095.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33592.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.08},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.92},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.12},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":94277,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma G. is currently in the business of selling tomatoes and is requesting a loan to expand her business.

So the goods that Dilorom is selling are in strong demand among the population.\r\n<p>\r\nToday, Dilorom is planning to increase her business. For this reason she requests $800 for the term of 9 months. Dilorom is counting on your help and thanks you for your support.\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is a young entrepreneur who is very charismatic, and she tells us that the example of her parents led her to become a better human being.  For 13 years she has worked in a handicraft company located in the heart of the Sacred Valley of the Incas.  This company is an exporter and makes beautiful works in clay.  It is a well-established company and its finished products are of the highest quality.  Teresa feels content to continue working for this company that has given her the opportunity to grow and learn a lot.  She could open her own handicraft company, but would not do this due to her loyalty to her bosses, at least not in the near term.  On the contrary, with her savings from this work, Teresa opened a nightclub bar for tourists in downtown Urubamba, named Forastero.  Teresa now requests a loan to improve the premises of her nightclub: to buy lights and sound to improve the quality, to expand the capacity, and to buy a television set.\r\n\r\nTeresa is grateful for the opportunity provided through these means and she is committed to make each of her payments on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":497244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to improve her nightclub bar: to buy lights and sound to improve the quality, to expand the capacity, and to buy a television set.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":494.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":514.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":534.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":556.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.91,"local_amount":495.04,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":506.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128906047},{"amount":177.74,"local_amount":514.84,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":526.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633517},{"amount":184.85,"local_amount":535.44,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":547.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667937},{"amount":191.5,"local_amount":554.68,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":567.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851596}],"funded_date":"2010-03-02T14:40:56Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":185263,"name":"Eliza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Eliza S. is currently in the business of selling bags of charcoal at wholesale and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of charcoal to sell.
