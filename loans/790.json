Her customers are very happy with her quality of work and give her regular orders.\r\n\r\nShe has given birth to three daughters and two sons. Except for her eldest daughter, all of her children are enrolled in local school and getting their education.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan investment, he will buy candies and toffees in larger quantity that will allow him to fulfill the client orders on time and increase his income.\r\n\r\nIttefaq has a lot of confidence in her husband. She hopes that her family\u2019s living standard will be improved as a result of the loan investment.\r\n\r\nNote: \"In the photo, the lady holding a book (called Asasah Passbook) is

He works as a graphic designer; he mostly makes fliers, banners, stamps, calendars and other items. Jos\u00e9 helps his wife who knows computer science and works in the same field. They learned together some 12 years ago when Jos\u00e9 worked in his brother-in-laws\u2019 small company where he gained experience and got the idea to start his own business. Little by little he got materials and customers taking advantage of his other work that allows him to travel all over the country where he has opened new markets in cities like Neiva, Bogot\u00e1, Honda, Oca\u00f1a, Santa Marta and Ci\u00e9naga in the Magdalena department. Jos\u00e9\u2019s customers include retail stores, grocery stores, salespeople, beauty parlors and many other businesses that need publicity, bookbinding and other designs. In his business he works with 50% in advance, he buys the materials cash down and this is why he has in his inventory dyes, stamps, adhesive paper, bond paper, plastic wrap and a little bit of everything to meet his customers\u2019 demands. Jos\u00e9 uses the computer to make the designs and hires out the printing, bookbinding or cutting which is why he needs to have some cash on hand when he needs to hire another service. This is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to have some cash and to buy materials like stamps, paper adhesives, bond paper, etc. Jos\u00e9 also needs the money for his other business which is selling natural products. His biggest dream is to have a balance between his material and spiritual life, to get his family ahead, to be a better person.

She has 7 children, 4 of whom are in school now.  She operates a corner store.

She and her husband, a farmer, rely on each other to cover their family's expenses.\r\n\r\nSra. Fabiana is a member of a community bank.

She began this activity eight years ago with the help of her mother who gave her a pig. Because her activity consisted in the sale of corn, she could buy feed for her pig at a favorable price. When the pig had grown, she sold it and could buy several new pigs. She has a young daughter who attends the local school. Delia has to struggle on her own, because her husband died. Her wish is to be successful in her business for the sake of her daughter. She dreams about expanding her business and buy more pigs. The loan that she is currently applying for will be used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe second group member is Se\u00f1orita Mar\u00eda, aged 23, who rears and sells hogs at her home.

He wants to obtain a loan in the sum of 5000 somoni to increase livestock headcount and buy seeds.  He wants to buy several heads of cattle and small livestock.

He is married and has three children.  He has been involved in growing agricultural crops and animal husbandry for about five years.  Tuichi grows wheat and uses the leftovers to feed livestock.

She has some regular customers and is quite preferred in the zone because she always strives to keep a variety of products in her store so that her customers will always find what they are looking for.  Lately she\u2019s noticed that competition has become quite fierce so she\u2019s decided to take the situation in hand because this business is her main source of income and she always wants to stay one step ahead of her competition.\n\nBased on this, she\u2019s made the decision to invest in her business buying merchandise at wholesale so that she can have the store well-stocked with a variety of products that will help her keep her clientele and to attract new customers.  Because she does not have the necessary economic resources to invest in the business she\u2019s decided to make the investment through a loan she\u2019s requesting from INTEGRAL.  \n\nWith this loan she\u2019ll buy a variety of products for the store like: sugar, beans, rice, cookies, candy, beverages, vegetables, sweet bread and other products that will allow her to attract new customers.  In this way and with hope in God Almighty and with her work and dedication she and her family will attain better living conditions and she\u2019ll be able to maintain her business for more

Nevertheless, Faysuli faces inconvenience when producing her products because the work is done manually and her equipment is not the best. The result is that she can not fill large orders, nor can she automate the process. For this reason, Faysuli needs to buy a sealant machine that will permit her, after filling the tubes, to seal the frozen 'bolis', and also, a cooler to allow her products to be kept under the required conditions. Unfortunately, currently, Faysuli lacks sufficient capital to purchase this equipment, and for that reason, she is requesting a loan to make it possible to buy a sealant machine and a cooler, so she can produce products of even greater quality.\r\n\r\nFaysuli hopes that by improving the quality of her products, sales will grow and thus, she will achieve her dream: to have a large factory someday, generating jobs for people in need.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":987352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sealant machine and a cooler for the production of the \"bolis\" (frozen pops) she makes and sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-01T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-02T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faysuli  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":106773},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":109785},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112882},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":116066},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119340},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":122707},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126168},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":129727},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133387},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":137150},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141018},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":144997}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.35},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.43},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.73,"local_amount":106773,"processed_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":106997.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362213},{"amount":61.15,"local_amount":111187,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:36Z","rounded_local_amount":111420.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075508},{"amount":64.03,"local_amount":116423,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":116667.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902250},{"amount":61.3,"local_amount":111449,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:11Z","rounded_local_amount":111683.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326622},{"amount":323.79,"local_amount":588706,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":589942.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432008},{"amount":256,"local_amount":465462,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":466439.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617173}],"funded_date":"2012-02-02T21:22:49Z","paid_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":385215,"name":"Zarina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarina has applied for a loan from KIVA partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s vegetable-selling business.

working hard so that her family can get ahead.

It is for her children that she always puts in a great deal of effort so that she can provide them with all that they need.\r\n\r\nLuz Omaira currently runs her own business selling a variety of items such as clothing and stationery. Because she wishes to take advantage of the approaching school year, she wants to buy school supplies but she doesn\u2019t have enough money to make these purchases. A loan will allow her to buy note books, cardboard, pencils, erasers etc. so that she will increase her sales at this important time of year.\r\n\r\nHer greatest hope is that her children can get a good education and eventually go to university so that they can get well-paying jobs. She wants her husband and two children to have the best standard of living possible, so always at the back of her mind is the hope that sales increase, income increases too, so that she can achieve her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":988485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
