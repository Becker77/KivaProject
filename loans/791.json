For nine years, she has been running a business selling <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), clothing, and damask. Her experience in this domain has earned her a good reputation. She receives orders for various goods, such as cloth, damask, shirts, perfumes, and fashion accessories. \r\n\r\nThus, to have the necessary resources to satisfy her customers, she decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso eight years ago. The previous loans were all correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will enable her to buy: 15 lengths of <i>moyen riche<\/i> damask, 50 pairs of earrings, and about 15 insulated containers (coolers).

In this way, he will be able to take full advantages of his land, which is located in a good topographical zone, 600 meters from the city.  This will allow him to have more customers and obtain better earnings. As a result, he will be able to save and provide a better life for his family, make improvements to his house,  buy cattle, and  continue to work hard on his vegetable cultivations so that he can help his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":988579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds to grow corn, beans, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and to pay for 200 yards of plastic irrigation piping, insecticides, fungicides, fertilizers, and labor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Moises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":296.52,"local_amount":296.52,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":296.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645435},{"amount":69.11,"local_amount":69.11,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":69.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491900},{"amount":65.23,"local_amount":65.23,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-26T08:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":65.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736432},{"amount":69.14,"local_amount":69.14,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":69.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561732}],"funded_date":"2012-02-04T15:18:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:40:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":385332,"name":"Evelyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyne is 28 years old and married with two children ages two and seven.

For 15 years, Jos\u00e9 Octavio has sold consumer goods like snacks, fruit and pop, among other things, from a cart outside his municipality. His sales have always been good, but he\u2019s had to endure some insecure times. A short while ago, his merchandise and money were stolen, leaving him on the edge of bankruptcy and his sons had to endure being in a situation where even their basic needs couldn\u2019t be met. With the intention of recuperating a large part of his merchandise, Jos\u00e9 Octavio needs to purchase consumer goods. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have enough money to do so, that\u2019s why he\u2019s hoping for a loan that can permit him to purchase consumer goods, such as snacks, fruit and pop, among other things, and that way recuperate his inventory to be able to offer products to his clients. Jos\u00e9 Octavio \r\nWants his business to recover and to generate sufficient income to attend to the basic needs of his family, so his children can enjoy a better quality of life. Jos\u00e9 Octavio\u2019s dream is that his children have access to quality education and in the future are able to get a university education that will prepare them to find a good job that pays well.

Meat is in very high demand in Azerbaijan and people use it in everyday dishes like pilau and dolma.  \r\n\r\nThis business require a lot of physical strength and Farail spends most of his time in the open air. His wife helps him to feed the animals.  His monthly income is 200 AZN and Farail wishes to increase it. As meat is in high demand, he needs more capital to put into his business and cover the market.  For this purpose, he has applied for 1500 AZN. He will use the loan to buy 6 sheep, 2 calves and 1 cow. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":993377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy sheep and cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Imishli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.869722 48.06","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T02:50:03Z","loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farayil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.42},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":480.84,"local_amount":374.68,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":377.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269967678},{"amount":159.29,"local_amount":124.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":125.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276811749},{"amount":160.37,"local_amount":124.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-19T07:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283775420},{"amount":323.39,"local_amount":251.99,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-19T07:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":254.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294278595},{"amount":159.97,"local_amount":124.65,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":125.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301331463},{"amount":325.05,"local_amount":253.29,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":255.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315322694},{"amount":316.09,"local_amount":246.31,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:48:21Z","rounded_local_amount":248.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322931439}],"funded_date":"2012-03-03T02:09:20Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T11:48:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":385814,"name":"Mohubbat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohubbat  is 56 years old, married and lives in the small village of Imishli.

She sells different household articles, from electrical items to clothing.  She is a woman who confronts every day with courage.  She tells us that since her son was born, she has never gone backwards and has taken her business seriously since it is their only source of income.\r\nMaria has been in sales for about 25 years and she learned from her mother who was also in sales.  Maria opened a small store selling basic goods.  She sold meat that she bought from small local cattle ranches until she found that her current business of selling clothing and electrical items generated more income than the previous work.\r\nShe buys some of the products that she sells in local markets but she purchases most of them in other cities at better prices.  The day that she purchases the merchandise she rises at 5 am and it takes her the whole day.  Then she goes to sell in other areas as well as her own community.\r\nMaria is requesting a loan from the Campo Foundation to buy more merchandise.

hijos durante toda su vida, adem\u00e1s de que tiene muy buena reputaci\u00f3n por ser una persona muy trabajadora. \nJos\u00e9 Arcadio fue abandonado por la madre de sus hijos, por lo que el se encuentra a cargo de sus 3 hijos y son ellos los que lo motivan para que todos los d\u00edas trabaje fuertemente en su taller.\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio desde hace 39 a\u00f1os se dedica a la fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado, y gracias a esto genera los ingresos necesarios para sostener los gastos de su hogar. Jos\u00e9 Arcadio tiene un taller de fabricaci\u00f3n de calzado en el que tiene muy buenas ventas, gran parte de esto debido a la buena calidad de sus productos y a su buena atenci\u00f3n a los clientes.\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio ha visto como se han aumentado sus ventas, por lo que tiene grandes pedidos de sus clientes por entregar. Debido a esto requiere comprar materiales e insumos para la fabricaci\u00f3n del calzado, como lo es el caucho, el pegante, entre otros; sin embargo, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio no cuenta con el capital suficiente para poder afrontar estas compras, por lo que tiene la esperanza de que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a la compra de los materiales necesarios para la fabricaci\u00f3n del calzado como los son el caucho, el pegante, el cuero, entre otros, y poder as\u00ed cumplirle a sus clientes sin tener que ver afectado sus ingresos mensuales.\nJos\u00e9 Arcadio tiene el gran sue\u00f1o de que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad, y que en un futuro tengan la posibilidad de estudiar una carrera universitaria. Adem\u00e1s, Jos\u00e9 Arcadio sue\u00f1a con que su taller pueda crecer y se consolide, de modo que genere grandes ingresos de los cuales sus hijos puedan obtener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica en un futuro.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Arcadio is known as someone who has dedicated his life to his home and children.  He also has a very good reputation for being a hard worker.  He was abandoned by the mother of his children and so cares for the three who are his motivation for working so hard every day in his workshop.\r\n\r\nFor 39 years he has been making shoes and using the income to cover household expenses.  Jos\u00e9 Arcadio's shop has a very high sales volume because of the quality of his products and good customer service.

She will also buy poultry birds at 30,000 KES to help her venture into poultry farming as well.

\nHugo se ha desempe\u00f1ado por m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os en el negocio de las comidas r\u00e1pidas, y ha variado sus ventas desde pl\u00e1tanos, papas, chicharrones, entre otros.\nHugo, actualmente trabaja en su carro de comidas r\u00e1pidas, el cual ya se encuentra en un estado deplorable, por lo que sus clientes a menudo ya son reacios a comprar sus productos por la condici\u00f3n de su carro de comidas. Es por esto que Hugo aspira a poder comprar un nuevo carro de comidas r\u00e1pidas, el cual le permita desempe\u00f1arse con mayor facilidad y no aleje los clientes de su negocio, sin embargo, Hugo no cuenta en la actualidad con el capital suficiente para comprarlo, por lo que aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de comprar un nuevo carro de comidas, que le permita trabajar con mayor sanidad sus comidas r\u00e1pidas, y sus clientes no se alejen por el deterioro de su herramienta de trabajo.\nHugo espera que con el cambio de su carro de comidas sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, y de esta manera pueda brindarles una mejor calidad de vida a su esposa y sus 5 hijos. Adem\u00e1s, sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria y tengan una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica en un futuro, por lo que trabaja fuertemente para dejarles una buena fuente de ingreos.\n","en":"Hugo has been a hard-working person all of his life.  Also, he is well-known for always wanting to improve his family\u2019s well-being.  Hugo, age 67, is married and has five children; he wants to give them everything they need.\r\n\r\nHugo has worked in the fast food business for over 20 years.  He sells various foods such as bananas, potatoes, and \u201cchicharrones\u201d (pork rinds), among others.\r\n\r\nThe fast food cart that Hugo now works with is in deplorable shape.  His customers are frequently reluctant to buy his products because of the condition of his food cart.  That is why Hugo is hoping to be able to buy a new fast food cart.  This would allow him to work more easily, and it would not drive the customers away from his business.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hugo does not now have enough capital to buy it.  That is why he hopes that a loan will give him the opportunity to buy a new food cart.  This will allow him to work with his fast food in a more sanitary manner.   Also, his customers will not go away because of the deterioration of his work tool.\r\n\r\nHugo hopes that with the change of his food cart his sales will increase considerably.  This way he will be able to give his wife and their five children a better quality of life.  Also, he dreams of his children being able to access a university education and of them having financial stability in the future.

Gracias a un amigo que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 la labor, Rodil ahora trabaja en la metalister\u00eda, actividad que le permite generar los ingresos necesarios para el sostenimiento de su hogar, donde convive con su esposa. \nRodil ha trabajado durante mucho tiempo como ayudante en un taller de metalister\u00eda, pero un d\u00eda decidi\u00f3 independizarse y mont\u00f3 su propio taller. \nDesde entonces Rodil tiene su taller de metalister\u00eda donde tiene muy buenos clientes debido a su buen servicio y a la buena calidad que ofrece, y donde tiene muy buenos pedidos para realizar trabajos a sus clientes.\nActualmente Rodil tiene buenos pedidos de sus clientes, sin embargo, debido a que no posee la infraestructura completa para ofrecer el servicio completo a sus clientes, Rodil ve como no pueda contratar con sus clientes la fabricaci\u00f3n de algunos productos. Es por esto que Rodil pretende acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina rectificadora de cilindros que le permita tener los contratos de sus clientes, sin embargo, la m\u00e1quina es muy costosa y Rodil apenas cuenta con aproximadamente el 60% de su valor. Por esto, Rodil tiene la esperanza de que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder a la compra de la m\u00e1quina rectificadora de cilindros y de esta manera pueda seguir teniendo todos los contratos con sus clientes.\nRodil sue\u00f1a con que su negocio le genere grandes ingresos, de modo que le pueda mejorar la condici\u00f3n de vida que tiene su esposa actualmente, y tambi\u00e9n quiere que sus padres puedan obtener una mejor calidad de vida. \nAdicional a esto, Rodil sue\u00f1a con tener su propia casa, donde pueda tener mayor privacidad con su esposa, y puedan tener una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Rodil is a very charismatic person who his family feels is always trying to help others.  Since he was very young he has always been a hard worker in different business activities.  Thanks to a friend who taught him the trade, Rodil now is involved in metalworks which allows him to generate enough income to cover household expenses for himself and his wife.\r\n\r\nFor many years he worked as a metal workshop assistant but decided to become independent and set up his own workshop.  Since then Rodil has been running his metal business and gaining many customers because of his quality work and customer service.  He receives many orders.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rodil has many orders but does not have the infrastructure he would need to fill them, nor the resources to outsource the jobs.  So he wants to buy a cilinder grinding machine to attend to customer contracts.  The machine is very expensive and Rodil can barely cover 60% of the cost.  Therefore he is hoping to obtain a loan to buy the machine and fill customer orders.\r\n\r\nRodil's goal is for his business to generate a good income so he and his wife can have a better lifestyle.  He also wants his parents to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAlso, Rodil hopes to have his own house so he and his wife can have more

Because of this work, Lina Maria can earn enough money to provide her family with the basic necessities and give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAs she has a good contract with the sewing business, Lina Maria now needs to hire someone and buy another sewing machine. She can\u2019t afford to do this so she is hoping that a loan will help her buy a sewing machine for the person she will hire to help her do the work for her customer.\r\n\r\nLina Maria\u2019s dream is for her workshop to keep on growing and her contracts to continue multiplying so that she can hire more employees.

She used to live in a tough neighbourhood where she lost two of her children, one of whom used to help her pay for household expenses. She is a single mother still responsible for her daughter and granddaughter. As she was the only one who could earn a living, she began searching in the streets for any way she could to earn money. She sold a variety of merchandise. Because she is very organised, she saved a large part of her income and with help from a government subsidy, she managed to buy a house at a good price.\r\n\r\nCurrently Maria Ofelia runs a store out of her house where she sells basic, everyday items.

es una persona que es conocida por su familia y sus vecinos por ser muy trabajador y dedicado al bienestar de su familia y las dem\u00e1s personas.\nHenry, con 40 a\u00f1os de edad, se encuentra casado y es padre de 2 hijos de 2 y 9 a\u00f1os, los cuales son la motivaci\u00f3n para trabajar arduamente todos los d\u00edas.\nHenry anteriormente laboraba vinculado a una compa\u00f1\u00eda, pero un d\u00eda tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n de independizarse debido a que el trabajo era muy mal pago y no le alcanzaba para generar los ingresos suficientes para el sostenimiento de su familia.\nHenry inici\u00f3 su negocio de venta de calzado con un capital muy bajo, pero gracias a los cr\u00e9ditos que le han otorgado ha podido ir mejorando su negocio, surti\u00e9ndolo con mayor variedad de productos y atrayendo as\u00ed una mayor clientela. Henry desde entonces ha podido mejorar su empresa considerablemente y actualmente tiene m\u00e1s clientes que los que puede atender.\nEs por esto que Henry en el momento busca comprar m\u00e1s surtido de calzado, pero no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar la compra de esta mercanc\u00eda, por lo que tiene la esperanza puesta en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de mercanc\u00eda de calzado para surtir su almac\u00e9n y tener una mayor cantidad para ofrecer a sus clientes.\nHenry espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues podr\u00e1 atender a m\u00e1s clientes que antes no pod\u00eda atender.\nHenry tiene el sue\u00f1o de que su negocio le genere grandes ingresos de modo que pueda brindarles en un futuro una mejor educaci\u00f3n, y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica.\n","en":"Henry is person known by his family and neighbors as being very hardworking and devoted to his family\u2019s and other people\u2019s wellbeing.  He\u2019s 40 years old, married and the father of two children who are 2 and 9 years old and who are his motivation to work hard every day.\r\n\r\nHenry used to work as an employee in a firm but one day made the decision to go into business for himself because the job didn\u2019t pay very well and he didn\u2019t earn enough income to support his family.  Henry started his shoe selling business with very little capital but thanks to the loans he\u2019s been granted he\u2019s been able to improve his business stocking it with a wider variety of products and attracting a larger clientele.  Since then, Henry has been able to improve his firm considerably and he currently has more customers than he can tend to.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, henry wants to buy a still wider selection of shoes but lacks sufficient capital to buy this merchandise so he\u2019s placed his hope on a loan that will allow him to buy merchandise to stock his shoe store and have larger amounts to offer his customers.\r\n\r\nHenry hopes that his income will increase considerably this way because he will be able to take care of more customers than he\u2019s been able to to date.  Henry\u2019s dream is that his business generates great income so that he can provide a better education and economic stability in future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":991613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Marinilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T19:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T19:20:01Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":106773},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":109785},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":112882},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":116066},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":119340},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122707},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":126168},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":129727},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":133387},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":137150},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":141018},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":144997}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.51},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.59},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.71},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122.61,"local_amount":216368,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":222166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075554},{"amount":63.85,"local_amount":112668,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":115687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902292},{"amount":65.58,"local_amount":115735,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":118836.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326660},{"amount":67,"local_amount":118235,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":121403.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432047},{"amount":69.39,"local_amount":122449,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":125730.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378090},{"amount":72.68,"local_amount":128266,"processed_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":131703.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432711},{"amount":72.6,"local_amount":128110,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":131543.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617201},{"amount":74.95,"local_amount":132271,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":135815.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640153},{"amount":79.26,"local_amount":139883,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":143631.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029229},{"amount":78.53,"local_amount":138575,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":142288.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165411},{"amount":83.55,"local_amount":147440,"processed_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":151391.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339547926}],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T23:50:42Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T16:18:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":384800,"name":"Maria Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Olga ha sido muy trabajadora durante toda su vida.

familia. \nCon 54 a\u00f1os de edad, Martha se encuentra casada y es madre de 2 hijos de 15 y 17 a\u00f1os de edad. Martha, siempre ha querido brindarles la mejor calidad de vida a sus hijos, es por esto que le colabora a su esposo en la generaci\u00f3n de ingresos para el hogar. \nDebido a las pocas oportunidades de empleo que se le presentaban, Martha decidi\u00f3 montar su propio negocio de comidas r\u00e1pidas, el cual ha sido el generador de los ingresos para que ella le pueda colaborar a su esposo en los ingresos del hogar.\nMartha, generalmente ha tenido muy buenas ventas, sin embargo, en diciembre debido a la temporada invernal que se vio, sus ventas disminuyeron significativamente, por lo que actualmente no cuenta con mucho dinero disponible. A pesar de que el panorama se le ha venido aclarando a Martha, pues sus ventas han aumentado en el mes de Enero considerablemente, a\u00fan cuenta con muy poco dinero disponible para comprar los insumos necesarios para la elaboraci\u00f3n de las comidas r\u00e1pidas para la venta a sus clientes. Es por esto que Martha aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de insumos como salsas, panes, carnes, entre otros para la elaboraci\u00f3n de comidas r\u00e1pidas. \n\nMartha espera que sus ventas sigan aumentando como lo han hecho en el mes de Enero y poder as\u00ed seguir generando ingresos suficientes para mejorar la calidad de vida de todas las personas de su hogar.\nMartha, tiene el sue\u00f1o de que su negocio crezca, y en un futuro, le brinde la posibilidad de ofrecerles a sus hijos un acceso a la educaci\u00f3n universitaria y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica en sus vidas.\n","en":"Martha has always been noted for being a very hardworking person who is devoted to her family.  She\u2019s 54 years old, married and the mother of two children who are 15 and 17 years old.  Martha has always wanted to provide a better quality of life for her children and this is why she collaborates with her husband generating income for the home.\r\n\r\nBecause of the few employment opportunities she had, Martha decided to open her own fast food business which has generated income that she can use to share household expenses with her husband.  Martha\u2019s sales are generally very good.  However, because of the winter conditions in December, sales dropped considerably so she doesn\u2019t have much money available presently.  Even though Martha\u2019s outlook has been improving since January sales have improved considerably, she still has very little disposable money to buy the necessary ingredients to make the fast food to sell to her customers.  This is why Martha hopes for a loan that will give her the opportunity to buy ingredients like sauces, bread, and meat, among others, to make her fast food.\r\n\r\nMartha hopes that her sales will continue to increase like they\u2019ve done in the month of January so that she can continue generating sufficient income to improve the quality of life for everyone in her home.  Martha\u2019s dream is that the business grows and in the future to provide her children with access to a university education and economic stability in their life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":991730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Guarne","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Ines ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":49822},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":51229},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":52675},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":54162},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55690},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":57262},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58879},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60541},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62250},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":64007},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":65813},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":67670}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.1},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.95},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.6},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.57},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.47,"local_amount":49822,"processed_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":51587.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362263},{"amount":33,"local_amount":57754,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":59800.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075560},{"amount":63.69,"local_amount":111458,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":115406.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326665},{"amount":30.85,"local_amount":53987,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":55899.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378096},{"amount":60.97,"local_amount":106698,"processed_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":110478.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432716},{"amount":4.35,"local_amount":7618,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7887.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617206},{"amount":36.69,"local_amount":64209,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":66483.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640157},{"amount":65.7,"local_amount":114971,"processed_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":119044.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029233},{"amount":76.28,"local_amount":133483,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":138212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165415}],"funded_date":"2012-02-13T21:52:05Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":386653,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilson lives in Mombasa, Kenya.

esposo, pues con lo que el ganaba en su empleo, no era suficiente para poder satisfacer plenamente todas las necesidades de su hogar. \nMaricela, con 33 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre de 2 hijos de 6 y 12 a\u00f1os, a los cuales siempre les ha querido brindar la mejor educaci\u00f3n posible. \nEs por esto que Maricela, luego de haber trabajado en un taller de confecci\u00f3n durante mucho tiempo, decidi\u00f3 retirarse y empezar a trabajar como independiente, por lo que mont\u00f3 una sala de internet. \nMaricela desde entonces trabaja en su sala de internet todos los d\u00edas para generar ingresos suficientes para aportar a los gastos de su hogar.\nMaricela actualmente tiene muy buena clientela, y gracias al buen servicio que ella ofrece a\u00fan sigue aumentando la visita de sus clientes. Sin embargo, Maricela no cuenta con el servicio de impresi\u00f3n y scanner, servicio que sus clientes le han pedido durante mucho tiempo, pues no cuenta con el capital suficiente para ello. Es por esto que Maricela quiere comprar una fotocopiadora que sea multiusos y tambi\u00e9n le permita ofrecer el servicio de scanner a sus clientes. Pero como Maricela no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar esta compra, tiene la esperanza en que un pr\u00e9stamo le permitir\u00e1 acceder a la compra de una impresora multiusos que le permita imprimir, fotocopiar y scannear, de modo que sus clientes encuentren en su caf\u00e9 internet todas las necesidades satisfechas.\n\nMaricela espera que de esta manera sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, y as\u00ed pueda ofrecerles a su esposo y sus 2 hijos una mejor calidad de vida.\nMaricela tiene el sue\u00f1o de que sus hijos puedan acceder a una educaci\u00f3n de calidad, y en un futuro acceder a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria que les permita prepararse para un empleo bien remunerado.\n","en":"Maricela has always wanted to help her husband pay for home expenses, because what he used to earn at his job wasn't enough to fulfill all of their needs.\r\n33-year-old Maricela has two children aged 6 and 12, and she has always wanted to provide the best possible education for them. That's the reason why, after having worked at a dressmaking shop for a long time, Maricela decided to retire and start working independently by setting up an internet caf\u00e9.\r\nEver since then, Maricela has worked at her cybercaf\u00e9 everyday in order to get enough profits to contribute to her home expenses. Maricela currently has very good clientele and, thanks to the good service she provides, her customer's visits are still increasing. However, Maricela doesn't dispose of a printing and scanning service, which her customers have long been asking for, because she lacks the working capital for it. That is why Maricela wants to purchase a multifunction copier which also allows her to offer scanning services to her customers. But, since Maricela doesn't have enough capital to make that purchase, she hopes the loan will allow her to purchase a multifunction copier for printing, photocopying and scanning, so that her customers can have all of their needs met at her internet caf\u00e9.\r\nMaricela hopes that by doing that, her sales will considerably increase, and she will be able to improve her husband's and her

She's 63 years old and lives in the town of Granada. She has two children who are already independent. She attended a nuns' school in Chinandega in order to study for a career in nursing. Soon she was sent to the town of Granada to practice her profession. There she got a permanent job as a nurse at a hospital, got settled, married and raised her children, but then she retired. She currently provides nursing services privately from her home. She is very well-known in her neighborhood, because of how experienced and friendly she is.

She introduced new products little by little in order to provide more variety and diversity at the store, so it will keep running and allow her to pay for her children's education. Her husband works as a tailor while she manages the business as well as their home.\r\nShe got the loan in order to purchase basic grains, cleaning products, olive oil, juices, canned goods, milk, eggs and school supplies. She still has plans to improve the store, get more merchandise, purchase shelves and window displays and save money for her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":991827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase basic grains, cleaning products, olive oil, juices, canned goods, milk, eggs and school supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Granada","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-02-02T22:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-03T22:40:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara Del Carmen \t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":260.51,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":86.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":86.83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263382053},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":86.84,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095581},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":86.84,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710194}],"funded_date":"2012-02-03T00:22:54Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":386748,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita is 53 years old and lives in the Philippines with her husband and four children.

He wants to purchase the seeds, the fertilizer, the irrigation pipes, etc.; however, he currently doesn't dispose of the capital he needs to do it. That's why he hopes that the loan will give him an opportunity to purchase the seeds to sow this vegetable, the fertilizer, the irrigation pipes, among other things.\r\nDenilson hopes his crop will get higher sales, because he will have more produce to offer his customers. With the new profits, he hopes to improve his family's living conditions.\r\nDenilson dreams of owning a farm on a land of his own, without the need to pay for a lease.

Aleida, una persona que siempre se ha dedicado a buscar oportunidades de ingresos y siempre ha querido que su familia tenga la mejor calidad de vida posible. \nCon 42 a\u00f1os de edad, Aleida se encuentra casada y es madre de 3 hijos, los cuales son la motivaci\u00f3n para trabajar fuertemente todos los d\u00edas.\nAleida, anteriormente se dedicaba a trabajar vinculada en empresas, y ejerc\u00eda diferentes labores, pero no le gust\u00f3 la idea de tener que trabajar tan fuerte por un salario tan bajo. Es por esto que entonces decidi\u00f3 montar su propio negocio de comidas el cual le generara mayores ingresos para el sostenimiento del hogar.\nAleida inici\u00f3 su negocio de comidas fritas, como papas, empanadas, entre otros, hace aproximadamente 5 a\u00f1os, y desde entonces ha venido ejerciendo esta actividad como m\u00e9todo de generaci\u00f3n de ingresos. Aleida, tuvo un tiempo en el cual no pudo trabajar mucho, puesto que su esposo se encontraba enfermo y necesitaba cuidarlo. Por esto, su negocio hoy se encuentra con niveles muy bajos de ventas, apenas esta recuperando la clientela y espera poder iniciar de nuevo.\nEs por esto que Aleida espera comprar insumos para preparar sus comidas fritas, adem\u00e1s de unas vitrinas para exhibir su comida. Sin embargo, no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar estas compras, por lo que tiene la esperanza en que un pr\u00e9stamo le brindar\u00e1 la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de los insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas fritas como empanadas, papas, entre otros, y la compra de unas vitrinas de exhibici\u00f3n que le permitan tener a la vista de sus clientes los productos que ofrece.\n\nAleida espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, y pueda as\u00ed ofrecerles una mejor calidad de vida a las personas de su hogar. \nAdem\u00e1s, Aleida sue\u00f1a con que sus hijos tengan la oportunidad de acceder a una educaci\u00f3n superior.\nAleida tambi\u00e9n se ha impuesto una meta y es que pueda comprar o construir apartamentitos para arrendarlos y vivir el arriendo de estos.\n","en":"Hardworking and dedicated to her family are the words that would best describe Aleida, a person who has always been on the lookout for income generating opportunities and has always wanted her family to have the best possible quality of life. \r\nAleida is 42 years old, she is married and the mother of three children, who are her motivation to work hard every day. \r\nAleida used to work for different companies and she did different jobs, but she did not like the idea of having to work for such low wages.  This led her to decide to start her own food business, which generated a better income with which to sustain her family.\r\nShe started her fried food business, selling French fries and pasties, among others, approximately five years ago, and since then this activity has been her source of income. Aleida went through a period during which she could not work very much because her husband was ill and she needed to look after him. Because of that, her sales are very low at the moment. She is only now recovering her clientele and hoping to get started once again.\r\nFor this reason, she is hoping to buy ingredients for her fried foods and some display counters to exhibit them. However, she does not have the necessary capital to make these purchases, so she hopes a loan will allow her to buy the ingredients to prepare her French fries and pasties, among other fried foods, and the display counters that will allow her customers to see what she has to offer. \r\nShe hopes her income will increase considerably in this way and she will be able to offer a better standard of living to her family members. \r\nAleida also hopes that her children will be able to access a college education.\r\nShe has set herself a goal: to buy or build small apartments that she can rent out and live from the money she gets from them.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":991796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She took orders from her customers and now she sells gold and silver in different designs. After she separated from her husband, her children never left her alone and have always supported her business. Only one daughter currently lives with her and helps her financially, because she's working. The place where she lives is beautiful because there are many trees and there's not much pollution from car fumes.

Since being abandoned, Gladis has been casting about for ways to make a living. \r\n\r\nCurrently she gives manicures to people in her area. She learned by watching the person who did her nails and then began giving manicures to family members and little by little started attracting new customers until she reached the point where today she has a large client base.

Saqer is requesting a loan from FATEN to help him cover the costs of purchasing new bedroom  furniture for his children as his family members need to feel more comfortable at home. This loan will create better living conditions for the family. Saqer is photographed in the picture.\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

He learned his work thanks to his father having taught him since he was very young, and along with his brothers he has been working ever since.\r\n\r\nJaime, who now has his own crops, has seen how the climate is causing his crops to fail, and for that reason he must install an irrigation system quickly, along with fertilizer for the seeds, to ensure that the crop does not fail completely. Jaime therefore wants to buy fertilizer, irrigators and seeds, which will allow him to keep his crop healthy - but he does not have the capital to take on the investment. For this reason he has pinned his hopes on a loan, which will enable him to buy the fertilizer, irrigators and seeds. with these, he will be able to keep his crop in good condition.\r\n\r\nJaime dreams that his wife and two children might have a stable future financially, so he is saving and seeking to generate new sources of income. He also dreams that he might offer his children a stable future, a better standard of living, and the opportunity to progress and one day have well-paid jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":992007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer, irrigation and seeds for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":49022},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50406},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":51829},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":53292},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":54796},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":56343},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":57933},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":59568},{"due_date":"2012-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":61250},{"due_date":"2012-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":62979},{"due_date":"2012-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":64756},{"due_date":"2013-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":66584},{"due_date":"2013-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68464},{"due_date":"2013-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":70396},{"due_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":72382}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.01},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.03},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.99},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.11},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.23,"local_amount":49022,"processed_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":49348.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263362271},{"amount":29.38,"local_amount":52888,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":53240.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075569},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":50369,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50704.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902305},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":53174,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":53528.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326673},{"amount":30.72,"local_amount":55301,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":55669.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432060},{"amount":32.26,"local_amount":58074,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":58461.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378104},{"amount":30.46,"local_amount":54793,"processed_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":55158.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432724},{"amount":34.49,"local_amount":62073,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":62486.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617213},{"amount":257.94,"local_amount":464306,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":467401.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640165}],"funded_date":"2012-02-09T07:13:25Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":387915,"name":"Jesus Vivi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe JESUS VIVI est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

Jorge Ivan no le gust\u00f3 seguir adelante con ese empleo debido a que era muy mal pago.\nJorge Ivan decidi\u00f3 tomar al camino de independizarse, y mont\u00f3 su propio taller de m\u00e1quinas para gimnasio, donde fabrica las m\u00e1quinas y tambi\u00e9n le hace mantenimiento a las m\u00e1quinas de varios gimnasios de la ciudad.

He worked in a city gymnasium for more than 12 years, as the person responsible for setting up and maintaining the equipment. Jorge Ivan did not want to continue doing this job due to the poor pay. He decided to go down the road of independence and he set up his own workshop for gymnasium equipment, where he manufactures and performs maintenance for several gymnasiums in the city. This provides Jorge Ivan with the necessary income to maintain his household.\r\n\r\nJorge Ivan currently has a contract to deliver some gymnasium machines to a very good customer of his and he needs more raw material to complete the production of this and other machines. However, he does have enough money due to the fact that his customer will pay him once the machine is delivered.

Therefore, when she grew up it was hard for her to find a job.  Thanks to a course that she was given, she learned how to make clothes.  Later, thanks to a very good boss that she had, she worked as a sewing machine operator in a business.  \r\n\r\nMarta Cecilia, age 64, is currently married and has two children.  She has always wanted to give them everything that they need.\r\n\r\nMarta Cecilia\u2019s boss offered her the chance to have a machine in her house.  This would allow her to work from home.  Therefore, Marta Cecilia now receives cut fabrics, and she sews them into garments.  Marta Cecilia is very behind in her production because she only has her one sewing machine.\r\n\r\nThat is why she wants to buy a sewing machine to generate a job and to have a person to help her with her work.  However, Marta Cecilia does not have enough money at this time.  This is why Marta hopes for a loan that will give her the opportunity to buy a sewing machine that will allow her to have an employee working at her side.\r\n\r\nMarta Cecilia hopes that her sales increase considerably because she will be able to get more work from the company.  This way she will be able to give her husband and her two children a better quality of life.

muy joven su madre le ense\u00f1\u00f3 la actividad. Siempre le ha gustado y es por esto que despu\u00e9s inici\u00f3 un curso donde le ense\u00f1aron m\u00e1s acerca de las t\u00e9cnicas de confecci\u00f3n. Una vez aprendi\u00f3 todas las t\u00e9cnicas y aprendi\u00f3 a producir prendas de vestir, su padre le regal\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina para iniciar su trabajo, y estas m\u00e1quinas las ha ido renovando con el pasar del tiempo. \n\nActualmente Luz Elena sigue con su propio taller de confecci\u00f3n y ya compr\u00f3 dos m\u00e1quinas m\u00e1s, adem\u00e1s de una mesa de corte y otras herramientas m\u00e1s para su taller. Gracias a la buena calidad de los productos que confecciona, Luz Elena tiene muy buena reputaci\u00f3n entre sus clientes, los cuales le hacen muy buenos pedidos. A menudo, Luz Elena tiene que contratar a 2 personas para que le ayuden con su trabajo, pues los pedidos son tan grandes que no le da para confeccionarlos ella sola. \n\nLuz Elena ha visto como sus ventas se han incrementado significativamente, y ya no la manera de confeccionarlos a m\u00e1quina y a mano no le esta dando resultados. Es por esto que Luz Elena acude a la esperanza de que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una m\u00e1quina de confecci\u00f3n industrial, con la cual pueda realizar su confecci\u00f3n de manera automatizada y produzca de manera m\u00e1s eficiente. \n\nLuz Elena sue\u00f1a con que su negocio siga creciendo y le genere buenas ganancias con las cuales pueda brindarles a su esposo y a sus 2 hijos de 14 y 18 a\u00f1os, una mejor calidad de vida y una prosperidad econ\u00f3mica y estable.\n","en":"Luz Elena has dedicated the greater part of her life to sewing since her mother taught her this business from a very early age. She has always enjoyed it and so later she decided to begin a course of study where she was taught more about the techniques of dressmaking. Once she learned all the techniques and learned to make articles of clothing, her father gifted her a sewing machine with which to begin her work, and she has been refurbishing these machines as time goes by. \r\n\r\nCurrently Luz Elena remains in business with her own dressmaking shop and has already purchased two additional machines, as well as a cutting table and other tools for her shop. Thanks to the good quality of the apparel she makes, Luz Elena has a very good reputation among her customers, who place very good orders with her. Frequently Luz Elena must hire two persons to help her with her work, since the orders are so large that she is not able to fulfill them all on her own. \r\n\r\nLuz Elena has seen her sales increase substantially, and making the clothes by machine and by hand is no longer producing results.  Thus Luz Elena turns to the hope that a loan may provide her with the possibility of being able to purchase an industrial sewing machine with which to construct the apparel in automated, and thus more efficient, fashion. \r\n\r\nLuz Elena dreams that her business would continue to grow and generate a good profit with which to offer her husband and two children, of 14 and 18 years of age, a better quality of life and stable financial prosperity.

At 39 years old, she is a single mother, head of her  family with a 6 year old son, who she is looking to provide with everything he needs. Damaris has worked for approximately 9 years selling personal care products, thanks to her grandmother who taught her well. Damaris currently has very good clients, and thanks to this she can affort the expenses of her home and can offer her son an education and stable life.\r\n\r\nDamaris has increased her sales thanks to the quality of her products, to the extent that she has had to pass up sales from some orders as a result of not having the capacity to respond to the request. Damaris has very low capital to buy the orders, which she would like to be able to sell in large quantities. Given that she currently has a large order from a client that she does not want to pass up, Damaris hopes that this loan will provide her the opportunity to make the purchase of personal care products such as lotions, makeup, and creams among others, and she can thereby complete her client's order and generate more income for her home. \r\n\r\nDamaris dreams of not having to sell in small quantities, rather she would like to get access to more capital that would allow her to have a larger distributor and hire many people who require income.

Nancy is a single mother and head of a family with 2 children, 16 and 13 years old, whose father abandoned them a long time ago. Nancy should generate enough income to support the expenses of her home and provide an education for her two children. Additionally, Nancy wants to provide the possibility of accessing education to her young niece, who doesn't have this possibility given her father abandoned her and her mom, Nancy's sister, finds herself unemployed. \r\n\r\nNancy learned to sew from her family as a young girl and she decided to open her own sewing workship where she offers sewing services to third parties. In this shop Nancy has very good sales, but has the inconvenience that the roof of the sewing workshiop is crumbling because it is made of wood and has a large leak. Nancy needs to urgently repair the roof, as she has been unable to use the shop due to fear that the roof will fall on her. Nancy, given that she doesn't have the money to perform the roof repair, hopes that this loan will allow her to repair the roof so it doesn't fall and she can continue working in her shop normally. \r\n\r\nNancy dreams that her sewing workship continues increaseing its sales, and that in this way she can generate employment for her family and other people who can't find employment opporutunities.

I had a hard time financing my high school education and I had to secure a scholarship to afford university education. \r\n\r\nI decided to pursue university education so that I can gain the necessary skills and knowledge required to compete in the job market. This will help me achieve my long-term dream of making the world a better place.

The fact that the university does not discriminate in terms of race, finances, religion or ethnic background is also a reason that made me choose Strathmore.\r\n\r\nThe laptop will help me finish my final year project on time, since I can access my coursework off-campus. It will also help me to develop IT skills by widening my knowledge in the field of software development, as I will have more time to develop systems. It will also help me complete assignments on time.\r\n\r\nI would like to be employed for a few years after university and, thereafter, start an IT firm dealing with application service provision.

He makes all types of gold and silver jewelry which he sells in the cities of Le\u00f3n and Managua although he would like to sell in other cities too but the lack of raw materials which are very expensive limits him.\r\n\r\nBecause of this he took out a loan to buy silver and artificial gem stones to make rings, chains, charms and bracelets because he needs raw materials to work and sell to improve his income.

Her husband and mother-in-law have been selling bread and firewood for 15 years but her mother-in-law passed the administration of the business to her.  Today, she and her husband share household tasks and the business in order to generate income to cover household expenses.  She sells bread and firewood at retail throughout Granada door to door and to grocery stores.\r\n\r\nShe took out the loan in order to buy firewood and bread to resell at retail.  With the loan she will be able to buy larger amounts of these products that she needs to sell and continue supplying her customers.  One of her dreams is to improve the infrastructure of her dwelling and to better furnish the place where she stores the firewood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":988872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
