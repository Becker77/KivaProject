Gerardo is 36, married, and has two children. He tells us he has done paint and body work for ten years. He is applying for this loan because the work he has requires the purchase of a lot of materials, so he wants to buy paint, wiping cloths, acrylic etc., to have ready for the cars.\r\n\r\nThere is also Hilario. He tells us that he has been a mechanic for ten years and has been the owner of a home-based auto body and repair shop for four years. He is applying for this loan because he needs to buy tools and materials for his work. \r\n\r\nThis is because there are people who come to leave their cars, and don't give him any advance notice, so he has to buy everything he needs, whether replacement car parts, or paint for doing body work. \r\n\r\nIn other cases, people don't pay him until the work is done; and this is when sometimes he doesn't have what he needs, so he's late finishing the jobs, because of the money that he has to invest in them. So he needs to stockpile gaskets, silicones, wiping cloths, tools, paint etc. Also, he tells us that he wants to buy a spray gun for painting cars. \r\n\r\nHe is confident that FAPE can offer him the

However, her good attitude and the desire to get ahead have allowed her to overcome them.  Dora is a single mother head of household with three children because the father of her children died some time ago.  Since then, Dora has been the person in charge of generating income for her home.  However, the few employment opportunities have not made this very easy.  Seeing that finding employment was impossible, Dora decided to open a food business which to date has had good results because despite heavy competition the quality of her products have caused customers to prefer her over the other businesses.\r\n\r\nDora sells her merchandise primarily to neighbors in the sector and to family members but she wants to increase her clientele in order to increase her income.  Dora wants to set up a food stand in the street but needs some tables and chairs to furnish a good site for her customers.  However, she currently does not have enough money to make these purchases so is hoping for a loan that will allow her to buy tables and chairs to furnish a fast food stand outside her house.  Dora hopes that her income will increase considerably this way because she\u2019ll be able to attract more customers to her business because it will be visible to everyone.\r\n\r\nDora wants her children to have a better quality of life and her great dream is to someday be able to buy a house of her own where her children can have stability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":994501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-03T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-04T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dora Piedad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21352},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21955},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22575},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23212},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23867},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24541},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25234},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25946},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26678},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27431},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28206},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29003}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.32},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.57},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.45},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":11.51,"local_amount":19737,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20683.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075600},{"amount":12.72,"local_amount":21803,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":22848.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902332},{"amount":13.13,"local_amount":22501,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":23580.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326701},{"amount":27.55,"local_amount":47232,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":49497.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432087},{"amount":15.3,"local_amount":26229,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":27486.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432747},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":22844,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":23939.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617237},{"amount":15.09,"local_amount":25861,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":27101.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640187},{"amount":17,"local_amount":29153,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:37:16Z","rounded_local_amount":30551.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029257},{"amount":49.37,"local_amount":84640,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88699.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165435}],"funded_date":"2012-02-04T14:27:14Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":387289,"name":"Tessie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tessie is 47 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Desde entonces, Nubia ha aportado a los ingresos de su hogar colabor\u00e1ndole a su esposo con los gastos que se generan. \n\nNubia cuenta con muy buenos clientes, lo que ha hecho que sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente. Sin embargo, el invierno ha hecho que sus ventas disminuyan debido a que no tiene una carpa con qu\u00e9 taparse, sino tan solo un pl\u00e1stico que implement\u00f3 de manera recursiva que solo la tapa un poco de las lluvias. Con el \u00e1nimo de revertir esta situaci\u00f3n, Nubia quiere comprar una carpa para taparse, por lo que acude a un pr\u00e9stamo con la esperanza de que este le pueda brindar la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de una carpa para taparse de la lluvia y la compra de insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus comidas.\n\nNubia espera que de esta manera sus ingresos aumenten considerablemente, pues en \u00e9pocas de lluvias sus ventas no se ver\u00e1n tan afectadas.\nNubia sue\u00f1a con que en un futuro su negocio le permita brindarles a sus hijos una educaci\u00f3n de calidad y el acceso a una educaci\u00f3n universitaria, adem\u00e1s, de poder mejorar la calidad de vida de su esposo, sus hijos y ella.\n","en":"Nubia is a very hard-working person and always wants to provide the best quality of life to her husband and two children.  Due to the limited employment opportunities available to her husband, and the little income he was bringing home for this reason, Nubia decided to set up a fast food business outside of one of the city's universities.  Since then, Nubia has contributed to the household income, collaborating with her husband on expenses incurred.\r\n\r\nNubia has many good clients, which has caused her income to increase considerably.  Nonetheless, the winter has brought down sales because she doesn't have a tent for cover, only a plastic sheet that keeps out a little of the rain.  In an effort to reverse this situation, Nubia is turning to a loan in the hope that it will provide an opportunity to purchase a tent for protection from rain as well as to buy supplies for preparation of meals. Nubia hopes that this will result in a considerable increase in income, since sales won't be so affected by the rainy season.\r\n\r\nNubia dreams that her business will allow her to offer her children a quality education and access to a university education as well as improve quality of life for her husband, her children and herself."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":994760,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a tent for protection from the rain and to purchase supplies for meal preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-03T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-04T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nubia Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56940},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58547},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60200},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61899},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63646},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65443},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67290},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69189},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71142},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73150},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75215},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77339}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.93},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.02},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.15},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.31},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.93,"local_amount":115435,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":116650.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075609},{"amount":32.38,"local_amount":57566,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":58172.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902341},{"amount":352.69,"local_amount":626999,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":633602.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432096}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T01:49:11Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kara Gibson","image":1815905}},{"id":387391,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 40 year old a married woman with three children, two of whom are in school.

Approximately 22 years ago, Ruth took a class in order to paint country art, through which she learned how to do this activity. Since then, and with the thought of earning necessary income for her household, Ruth has produced her crafts and sold them to large customers she has. Currently, Ruth has so many orders that she cannot keep up with some of the orders her customers place. Thanks to this, Ruth is recognized for having very good products of very good quality. In addition to country art, Ruth makes linen goods for the home, which she also does by hand, and also sells to her customers. With the combination of the two activities, Ruth can contribute to generating the income necessary to cover the expenses of her household, which she shares with her husband and their 4 children.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Ruth has a large order from a customer that requires the purchase of raw materials in order to do it. This is why Ruth hopes that a loan will give her the opportunity to purchase raw materials such as paint, fabric, and various materials that she needs to make her crafts.\r\n\r\nRuth hopes that her sales will continue to increase, and she dreams that one day she will be able to have a large building where she can exhibit her products.

They are on average 46 years old, have 5 children each, and live in the rural commune of Sako\u00efba.\r\nThey met and are united through bonds of kinship, marriage, and are involved in the small business of selling ladles, mortars, and calabash gourds, both simple and engraved.  In order to increase their business, the members of the group have decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and have requested their 12th solidarity loan.  \r\nAminata, second woman from the right in the photo, is known for the sale of calabash gourds engraved with beautiful motifs and patterns.  She is planning to use her loan to buy 300 calabash gourds which will be engraved.  Engraving is done by dipping needles in the fire for at least an hour.  After the needles have become red, they are removed from the fire and used to make beautiful designs on the back of the gourds.  Aminata buys her raw materials at the Kati\u00e8na market.  She sells from home, in nearby villages, and at the Grand Market in S\u00e9gou, for cash or on credit, to mostly women customers.  With this loan, Aminata expects average monthly profits to reach 25,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in the activity and also used to take care of household expenses and children's healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":999214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy calabash gourds.

19. \r\n\r\nLucia has been making and selling tortillas from her home for ten years. At first she sold snacks to children who passed by on their way to the local school. When she realized that there was no place selling tortillas in the surrounding area, she started one, thanks to the support she got from a girl who worked with her as a helper. \r\n\r\nShe now also sells traditional clothing in the capital city, but only on Sundays. So she is applying for this loan to buy corn at wholesale, and merchandise for her business selling traditional clothing. \r\n\r\nAs a small business owner, she got to know Maria Eugenia, who for three years has been making and selling carnitas and chicharrones (barbecued pork and pork rinds) beside Lucia's tortilla stand. \r\n\r\nEugenia has the business she runs thanks to her mother's initiative in renting a place, and in making a name for herself in her community for the rich, delicious way she makes her carnitas and chicharrones. Now they have two chicharrones stands in the capital city. \r\n\r\nLucia needs working capital to be able to invest a bit more in her tortilla and traditional clothing businesses for the Christmas and New Year's season. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Eugenia also had several meat orders for Christmas gatherings, so they are deciding to work together as loan partners and successful women.

As the father of two children, aged 7 and 14, Juan Carlos has a home where he has always been a good example. His wife and he are role models to their two children.\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos distributes bakery products and sweets. He learned this activity when he worked in a store. When he realized one day that his job was very poorly paid, he decided to become independent and launch his own business. In the beginning he distributed the goods on a motorcycle, then a few loans helped him to buy a car and he could serve more customers because he could transport a larger quantity of goods.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Juan Carlos runs his business with a very good customer base and because of this his income has increased considerably. Often he has so many customers that he can't serve them all, because his inventory is not sufficient for all his customers.

She is married to Gerardo and has two children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosana operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these to junk shops for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 12,000. She will use the loan as part of her current revolving fund used to buy recyclable materials from collectors. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosana hopes her business grows more in the coming years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":997778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for scrap materials needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-04T14:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-05T14:00:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4288,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275487},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997932},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3430.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606471},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:20:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1715.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095333}],"funded_date":"2012-02-04T16:50:16Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:20:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":387712,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice is 26 years old.

She looks after them in her parents' house which is located in the city of Jauja. Her melancholic expression is due to the death of one of her children who passed away one month ago. She feels sad but she knows that she must continue working in order to get her other children ahead in life. Her main job is to provide a laundry service for her neighbors, who pay her according to the amount she washes. She earns some money from this but she does not always carry out this service. Therefore, in the mornings she works in a house where she cleans and cooks. There they pay her a monthly salary which allows her to financially support her home. \"I have many jobs since I support my children by myself\", she states. \r\n\r\nNow her plan is take advantage of the job that the city government is offering for the construction of a new road. She says that her children will stop receiving the orphan's pension and she wants to get a stable job. She therefore wants to set up a work tricycle to sell candy on the streets, in schools and at festivals where there is good demand. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to support group \"Sin Fronteras\" [Without Borders] and this is her third loan with MFP.

She gets up early every day to attend the to the residents of her town, who constantly visit her to buy food. She already has 3 years experience selling basic necessity products. At the same time, thanks to help from her children, she plants potatoes, beans and quinoa on rented land, as she doesn't have her own. It is going very well for her and after every harvest she sells her products at the city market.

She has been selling traditional clothes for the past 15 years. She told us that she needs this loan, because the season for uniform blouses is ahead and she has customers who will buy them. Currently, she wants to buy school sweater for resale. She is happy because she knows that if her loan is granted, she will be able to achieve her goals. She applies for this loan to buy traditional clothing and school sweaters.\r\n\r\nThe group has a second member: Do\u00f1a Oralia de los \u00c1ngeles, aged 21, is married and the mother of a son. She owns a small store and applies for this loan to stock up her inventory. In addition, the school term has begun and she will buy school supplies for the children, so that people in her neighborhood don't need to travel to town to get the school supplies for their children, but buy them from her store. People know and expect that Oralia will soon start selling these supplies.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies are hard-working people and their only wish is to help their husbands with household expenses and offer a better living standard to their children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":990747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy typical clothes and school uniforms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Juan Sacatep\u00e8quez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2012-02-04T14:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-05T14:50:02Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oralia De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Toribia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.7},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":680.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297498},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":680.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270016788},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":680.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277206848},{"amount":175,"local_amount":1333.32,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:55:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850801},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":666.66,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:13Z","rounded_local_amount":680.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551641}],"funded_date":"2012-02-05T22:00:20Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:37:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":387728,"name":"Peter","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter is 57 years old from Ndunyu-Njeru and is married with children.\r\n\r\nPeter is a farmer and has applied for a loan from KADET Ltd, to enable him buy farm inputs, chemical sprays and labor expenses.

Now they have only 38 examples but they are working to expand and for this they want to build more places where they will live. They do not only raise guinea pigs but also cattle, bulls and hens of good quality. From this they obtain earnings from selling milk and animals. Additionally, her husband works in the city government where they pay him a monthly salary. On the weekends, the two of them are dedicated to planting maize and alfalfa in their own farm land. Alfalfa helps with feeding their children but the maize is sold in the same farm since it is very good quality and they already have fixed buyers.

However, because of his dedication and desire to get ahead in life, he has been able to overcome these difficulties and make progress with his family.  For most of his life, he has worked in granaries, and in wholesale and retail stores.  With the experience that he acquired over almost 20 years, he decided to establish his own general store where he offers basic consumer goods for sale.  Jose Nicolas, thanks to his store, is able to generate the income he needs to support his household, including his wife and their 3 children.  Some time ago his shop was looted, and this was an adversity that he overcame with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nNow Jose Nicolas has good sales and a large number of customers, and so his inventory of merchandise has diminished considerably.  With the intention of increasing the quantity of products that he offers, Jose Nicolas wants to buy a glass display case and some shelving where he could place more products on display for his customers.  He also wants to buy a greater variety of products to offer them.  However, Jose Nicolas does not have enough capital to make all of these purchases, and so it is for this reason that he is hoping to get a loan.  This loan will provide him with the opportunity to buy a glass display case and shelving where he could exhibit the products that he offers to his customers.\r\n\r\nJose Nicolas hopes that in this way, his sales will increase a lot, as he will have more to offer to his customers.  In addition, he hopes that he will increase his earnings, and so will be able to provide his wife and his 3 children with a better quality of life and more opportunities to get ahead in life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":996334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

With the money that she won in this raffle, she bought clothing and started to sell it to her relatives, friends and neighbors.  In this way, she was contributing income to support the household expenses.  Since then, Omaira has increased her sales, because of the good quality of her products.

She sells beverages, manioc and enchiladas, among other things that people like in the streets of her town during market or other festive days.

But when Sandra\u2019s first daughter was born while she was still a minor she decided to start being a street vendor of beverages, manioc and enchiladas, among other things.\r\n\r\nShe buys the ingredients she needs for her sales at a local store in town every day.  Sandra wants to start selling women\u2019s clothes and this is why she\u2019s asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan: to buy blouses, skirts and pants among other items and in time she will add still more.

On the other hand, she does not like it when some of her customers ask for credit for their purchases, and after a time they do not want to pay.\r\n\r\nShe now has plans to continue with her business and to make it grow.  This will be her eighth loan with MFP.  She therefore hopes for your participation in order to continue with her objectives.  She is comfortable with her communal bank.  They have supported her in everything, and for that she is grateful.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,800 soles to buy live chickens.  She is looking for the best prices for her purchase at the same poultry farm in order to get greater income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":996406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-04T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-05T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":260.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":287.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":298.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":300.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":320.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":331.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.9},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":97.82,"local_amount":260.84,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":263.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386410},{"amount":107.87,"local_amount":287.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":290.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099507},{"amount":111.9,"local_amount":298.4,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":300.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713652},{"amount":112.68,"local_amount":300.47,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:10Z","rounded_local_amount":302.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202540},{"amount":120.28,"local_amount":320.74,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":323.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098225},{"amount":124.45,"local_amount":331.88,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":334.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401024}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T09:34:04Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":387088,"name":"Maria De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda de  Jes\u00fas se considera una se\u00f1ora trabajadora se dedica a la venta de bolsas para dama  y a la venta de ropa desde hace dos a\u00f1os.\nElla tambien  nos cuenta que se dedica a la venta de jarafones con agua.\nEsta felizmente casada con el se\u00f1or Simon un se\u00f1or trabajador y humilde con quien tiene cuatro hijos por quien los dos trabajan para darles un mejor futuro.\nElla pidi\u00f3 el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de mas ropa y mas dulces para la venta.\nLe da las gracias fundaci\u00f3n por confiar en ella y apoyarla para que su negocio crezca.\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas considers herself to be a hardworking woman who has been dedicated to selling women\u2019s purses and clothes for the last two years.

During the week she goes from house to house offering the clothes and if there\u2019s some items she does not have she takes the order and then travels to the state capital every Friday which is when the street market is set up and she can buy at wholesale for good prices and once she\u2019s stocked up on her order she returns home and once again spends the week going from house to house where orders were placed delivering the clothes.  She sells on installments.  When she delivers the clothes they agree on a date to pay and she returns on the agreed upon day to collect the money.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n has been a FRAC client for five cycles in which she\u2019s been very responsible and punctual with her payments.

Quite a while ago the mother of his two children abandoned the family, and since then he has had to find a way to move forward with his children. \r\n\r\nGabriel was previously employed in a business where they did t-shirt printing, and thanks to that he learned how to do this. His job was not well paying so he decided to go out on his own and since then he has had his own printing shop. It is thanks to this that he is able to generate the necessary income to support his household. In his shop Gabriel is well known for offering high quality products, which has resulted in his sales increasing more and more with the passing of time. \r\n\r\nGabriel doesn't have the capacity for large production because he doesn't have a lot of work tools. Sometimes his workload is too high and he has to work late into the night, which wears him out and sometimes causes him to get sick. With the desire to improve this situation, Gabriel wants to buy some work tools which will allow him to be more efficient and take less time, and also be able to offer service to customers who place large orders. However, Gabriel doesn't have sufficient capital to be able to buy the tools. It is for this reason that he hopes this loan will give him the opportunity to buy the tools he needs, like printing frames and inks that will allow him to make more prints in less time and be able to provide service to customers who place large orders. \r\n\r\nGabriel hopes that as a result his sales will increase considerably, because he will be able to provide service to customers who before he was not able to, due to the small production capacity he has.

Jefferson makes a living working in a repair shop for motorcycles; he owns this business in partnership with his brother-in-law.

They have two grown sons. Irina has run her own business for nine years. She grows early vegetables. Irina decided to go into this business because it's very prospective  for her region. Right now, she has four large greenhouses and a \"nursery\" greenhouse, for seedlings. \r\nIrina is very responsible and hardworking with a desire to expand her business.

To reach her house one has to walk astray in the mountains to reach it faster. Faustina sells jackets, cosmetics and firewood. She is widowed and her children are all married, but they still support her in her sales and activities, which she has had for the past 20 years. She says that despite her age she does not want to quit her business, because it is her life and she really likes selling. She is well known, appreciated and admired by her neighbors because she works hard at all times and all places. Despite her age she asks God to grant her many years of life to allow her to keep on helping the women of her neighborhood, so that they can be pillars of hard work for their partners and offer the best possible to their children. Faustina got several requests for firewood and she wants to distribute it in her neighborhood, but she lacks the necessary capital and is forced to apply for a loan to buy firewood.\r\n\r\nHer fellow group member is Se\u00f1ora Ingrid Yolanda, aged 35, who sells general medicine  in her neighborhood with her husband and their three children. She followed a nursing course before her marriage.

She used to work in a restaurant but gradually became independent and began selling her own food to customers.  Cruz Elena is married and has two children for whom she has always wanted to provide the best she could.  Since her husband's salary is not enough to cover household expenses, Cruz Elena decided to set up her own business making blood pudding, tamales, chicken pies and other products which she sells to family, friends and neighbors.  She is able to generate enough income to contribute to household maintenance.\r\n\r\nCurrently Cruz Elena must make improvements in her kitchen since the health authorities made suggestions as to what she should do to upgrade her work site.  Since she sells her goods on a credit basis, and customers often get behind in their payments, Cruz Elena does not have much capital right now.  Therefore she is hopeful a loan will give her the opportunity to renovate her kitchen and be able to comply with the health authorities' requirements.\r\n\r\nCruz Elena hopes to increase sales because in the current conditions some markets are not open to her.  Once she has renovated her kitchen she can sell her products to more customers.  Cruz Elena's dream is to see her business grow significantly and that her children can enjoy a a stable economy in the

She lives with her common-law husband, Francisco who is a state employee.  They have three children, ages 16, 9 and 2 and they live in their own house which they bought through much effort.  Melita sells essential groceries which she transports along the Ucayali River to sell to different rural communities.  Sometimes she sells on credit, but most transactions are done in cash.  In the four years she has been in business she has attracted many customers.  Her husband also helps her in his free time.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it gives her extra income to take care of expenses.  Also, she gets to know other places and new people, while observing how her business grows through hard work.  What she does not like so much is having to be away from home and not being able to care for the children, but she knows that what she is doing is in their interest.  Through her efforts she is trying to give them a better lifestyle, doing all she can to grow her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan through the MFP institution.  She is counting on your help so she can meet her goals.  She is very comfortable with her communal bank because it is a united group and she has found support from everyone.  With the 2,000 PEN loan she plans to buy wholesale groceries to make a better profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":996475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy essential products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T16:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T16:30:01Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":289.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":319.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":331.42},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":333.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":356.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":369.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":108.63,"local_amount":289.68,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":292.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386415},{"amount":119.81,"local_amount":319.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":322.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099512},{"amount":124.29,"local_amount":331.42,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":334.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713657},{"amount":125.14,"local_amount":333.71,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":336.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202545},{"amount":133.58,"local_amount":356.22,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":359.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098230},{"amount":138.55,"local_amount":369.47,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":372.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401028}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T20:17:29Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":388191,"name":"Sharon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharon is a 27-year-old, single business lady in Mombasa.

She lives with her common-law husband, Tito, and they have two children, ages 5 and 2, whom they love very much.  They live comfortably in their own home which they bought through much effort.  Carol sells women's, men's and children's clothing which she buys in the city of Lima, where she travels periodically.  She has been in business for over three years with the support of her mother who helps out with sales and credit collections.  \r\n\r\nShe enjoys her business because of the good profits it generates.  Sometimes she sells as many as 100 garments a month.  She plans to open a clothing shop in one of the commercial areas of the city so she does not have to walk to find customers.

Her husband is a municipality employee who gets a low salary but enough to cover the family's costs. Fekrieh is requesting a loan from FATEN to help cover her costs for purchasing new bedroom furniture for her children. This will offer better living conditions to her family members. Fekrieh is photographed in a FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Su conocimiento lo obtuvo desde sus 14 a\u00f1os de edad, cuando su hermana dej\u00f3 de darle estudios formales  y decidi\u00f3 salir adelante aprendiendo un arte que se lo permitiera. As\u00ed fue como en el a\u00f1o 1971, trabaj\u00f3 en una empresa de confecciones durante un periodo de dos a\u00f1os,  y posteriormente aprendi\u00f3 otros proceso en diversas empresas confeccionistas, donde aprendi\u00f3 a operar maquinas industriales, trabaj\u00f3 en mejoramiento final de la prenda, y en todas las operaciones de la confecci\u00f3n durante un periodo de 15 a\u00f1os, hasta que desde hace 4  se dedic\u00f3 a su propio negocio en compa\u00f1\u00eda de una amiga, que posee   un taller en su casa, pero algunas  de las tareas las hace en su vivienda donde cuenta con una m\u00e1quina familiar, con la que simult\u00e1neamente atiende las necesidades de sus clientes en un n\u00famero no menor de 40.

She is a seamstress who makes all types of clothing for women, men and children. \r\n\r\nShe obtained her knowledge when she was 14 years old, when her sister stopped providing formal studies, and she decided to learn a skill that would enable her to get ahead. Thus it was that in 1971 she worked in a tailoring business for two years and later learned other procedures in a variety of tailoring businesses: she learned to operate industrial machines, she worked finishing articles and in all stages of tailoring for 15 years. Then 4 years ago she started her own business together with a friend who has a workshop in her house. However, she also does some work at her own home where she has a family sewing machine and meets the needs of her private customers who number no less than 40.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a great help since he works for an optical company and both of them contribute to the wellbeing of the family.\r\n\r\nDunia receives payment on delivery; sometimes they give her an advance payment of 50%, with which she begins the work Her garments are very well made and this has garnered wide recognition and attracted customers.\r\n\r\nCurrently Dunia is applying for a loan, her first funding from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy a serging machine which will enable her to optimize her time and improve her finishing. With this loan she will resolve one of her pressing needs, since to overcast seams she now has to go to the workshops of friends who let her use their machines. Her future goal is to have a well-equipped workshop with a good infrastructure that will enable her to concentrate all stages of production and generate jobs for other seamstresses. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":996492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a serging machine which will optimize her time and improve the finishing on her garments.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dunia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69284},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74789},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76534},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78320},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80148},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82018},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83932},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85890},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87894},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89945},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92044},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":69284,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":71908.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039216},{"amount":43,"local_amount":74789,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":77621.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651344},{"amount":44.01,"local_amount":76534,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":79432.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140954},{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":78320,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81286.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100847},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":80148,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83183.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338470},{"amount":357.03,"local_amount":620925,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":644442.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395038}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T18:52:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":387781,"name":"Francis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francis is 43 years old and married with two children.

They live in different parts of the city of Cuenca that is known as Saint Anne of the four rivers. Since December 1999, it is a Cultural Heritage Site. It is a city rich in culture and traditions. Its gastronomic variety captures the palate of natives and foreigners. Its people are friendly, kind and very charismatic, like our members, who are fighting, entrepreneurial women that look, in their daily work, for the best opportunities that will get their families ahead.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Martha.
