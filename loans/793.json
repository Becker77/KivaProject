She has operated a corner grocery store for about 5 years.  Her brother started the business and she worked for him there, only taking over the business after he died.  Miryam works hard to make the store pay, both to support her mother who can no longer work and to share with her husband the family's other expenses.  Miryam and her husband have 2 children and she wants to provide for them in every way she can.  Miryam's mother owns the building where they operate the store, so she doesn't have any rent-related expenses.  Even so, there's never been any money to properly stock the store and it's barely scraping by.  Miryam is applying for a loan so that she can buy the merchandise she needs to grow the business.  She wants to stock the store with both the everyday products her customers need and with other products that the might want.

Rodrigo vende su producto en su municipio a las principales tiendas del sector, y esto le ha permitido conocer un gran n\u00famero de clientes que le hacen grandes pedidos. Debido a que en el momento tiene un gran pedido por parte de un cliente que no puede satisfacer con el inventario que tiene actualmente, Rodrigo debe comprar la papa para poderle entregar el pedido a este, sin embargo, Rodrigo no cuenta con el capital suficiente para realizar esta compra, por lo que aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de grandes cantidades de papa para poder abastecer el pedido que le ha hecho un cliente.\t\n\nRodrigo espera poder seguir comercializando este producto y en un futuro poder diversificar los productos que ofrece. Es por esto que trabaja fuertemente todos los d\u00edas y ha ahorrado poco a poco con el \u00e1nimo de montar una gran comercializadora de verduras y legumbres.

A long time ago he began working as a laborer (loading and unloading trucks) in his town, and thanks to this work he met a friend who grows potatoes. The friend offered him the opportunity to sell potatoes, so that he could commercialize them in his town, and because of this, it has been two years since Rodrigo combined his work as a laborer with the sale of potatoes. Rodrigo sells his product in his town to the principal stores in the sector, and this has permitted him to meet a large number of customers who give him big orders. Because he now has a large order from one customer that he is unable to satisfy with the inventory that he now has, Rodrigo must buy the potatoes to be able to fill this order. Nevertheless, Rodrigo does not have sufficient capital to make this purchase, so he hopes that a loan will offer him the opportunity to make the purchase of large quantities of potatoes to be able to fill the order that one customer has placed with him.\r\n\r\nRodrigo hopes to be able to continue selling this product and in the future to be able to diversify the products that he offers. It is for this reason that he works hard every day and has saved little by little with the intention of setting up a large marketing operation for vegetables and fruits. Rodrigo dreams that his wife and his three children will have better opportunities to progress and can obtain a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":997205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a large quantity of potatoes to be able to fill the order which a customer has placed.\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-05T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-06T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodrigo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35587},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36592},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37625},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38687},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39779},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40902},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42056},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43243},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44464},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45719},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47010},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48336}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.57},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.87},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.94},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.43},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.57,"local_amount":72623,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":79042.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075641},{"amount":21.84,"local_amount":36407,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":39625.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902370},{"amount":23.2,"local_amount":38669,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":42087.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326732},{"amount":23.83,"local_amount":39720,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":43231.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432121},{"amount":24.34,"local_amount":40561,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":44146.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378160},{"amount":0.72,"local_amount":1192,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432781},{"amount":50.67,"local_amount":84442,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":91906.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617271},{"amount":111.83,"local_amount":186386,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:12Z","rounded_local_amount":202862.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640213}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T20:33:11Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":388255,"name":"Julius","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julius graduated from college with two degrees in Exercise Science and Sports Medicine.

All\u00ed tiene un negocio con el que genera los ingresos principales para el sostenimiento de su hogar y con el sue\u00f1a hacerlo crecer,  para lograr aumentar el bienestar de su familia y potenciar el desarrollo exitosos de su hijo. Cuando en el a\u00f1o 2000 inici\u00f3 su negocio, lo hizo con un peque\u00f1o capital, una vitrina y un poco de surtido; con sus ganancias y su disciplina de trabajo, logr\u00f3 un crecimiento gradual  compr\u00f3 una vitrina de segunda para ordenar sus mercanc\u00edas y exhibirlas apropiadamente. En la actualidad su proveedor la surte de mercanc\u00eda a consignaci\u00f3n, pero ella desea crecer por eso busca la forma de comprar en efectivo y en mayor cantidad y de diversificar sus proveedores. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  mediante el cual comprar\u00e1 \u00fatiles escolares, interiores, chancletas entre otros productos, aprovechando la \u00e9poca de ingresos de los estudiantes a clase, el cual es un momento de gran despliegue de ventas y sus ingresos se incrementan. Mientras tanto su meta, de obtener mas adelante su propia casa,  sigue en pie y Candelaria trabaja mucho para lograrla alg\u00fan d\u00eda y poco a poco, porque su mayor desaf\u00edo es el tener el capital de trabajo suficiente para lograr invertir y salir r\u00e1pidamente adelante. En su negocio sus cuentas por cobrar rotan cada 7 d\u00edas, sus inventarios rotan cada 14 y mantienen una rentabilidad sobre las ventas no menor del 38%, indicadores financieros desde los cuales se proyecta su negocio.  ","en":"Candelaria is 31 years old, lives with her 18 month old son, in the municipality of Soledad, 15 minutes away from the city of Barranquilla.  She has a business with which she generates the main income to support her home and she dreams with growing it to increase the well being of her family and enable a successful development for her son.\r\nWhen she started her business in the year 2000, she had little capital, a display cabinet and some merchandise; with her income and work ethic, she was able to grow gradually and bought a second display cabinet to organize and display merchandise appropriately.  Currently her vendor provides merchandise on consignment, but she wants to grow and is looking for the way to buy with cash and in larger quantities as well as to work with different vendors.  For this reason she came to credikiva, her first loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, through which she will buy school supplies, clothing, sandals and other products, taking advantage of the season in which the students have spending money, which is a great season for sales and her income will increase. In the meantime, her goal to buy her own house is still standing and Candelaria works hard to achieve that one day, her biggest challenge is to have working capital to invest and get ahead faster.  Her collecting cycle is 7 days and her inventory cycle is 14 days, she has a profit margin on sales of no less than 38%, these are the financial indicators she uses to project her

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJulieta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php500 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulieta hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Carlos Mario, una persona que a pesar de no proceder de una familia con abundancia econ\u00f3mica ha tenido la fortaleza suficiente para salir adelante y poder aportarle a sus padres una mejor calidad de vida. Carlos Mario anteriormente trabajaba en un taller de confecci\u00f3n, en el cual no quiso seguir trabajando debido a lo mal remunerado que era. Desde entonces, mont\u00f3 una tienda general, en la cual al principio solo vend\u00eda legumbres. Gracias a que Carlos Mario supo administrar su dinero, ahorr\u00f3 la mayor parte de sus ingresos y los reinvirti\u00f3 en su negocio, y ahora tambi\u00e9n vende productos de la canasta familiar. Carlos Mario ahora tiene unos peque\u00f1os ahorros y espera comprar unas vitrinas para exhibir sus productos en su tienda. Sin embargo, no cuenta con el dinero suficiente para poder comprar las vitrinas y comprar la mercanc\u00eda para surtir su negocio, por lo que espera que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la posibilidad de acceder a la compra de una vitrina para exhibir sus productos y a la compra de productos de la canasta familiar para surtir esta vitrina.\n\nCarlos Mario espera que de esta manera sus ventas aumenten considerablemente, pues su negocio estar\u00e1 mejor presentado para sus clientes, quienes podr\u00e1n encontrar mayor variedad de productos en su tienda. Carlos Mario sue\u00f1a con que sus padres puedan disfrutar de una mejor calidad de vida, y espera que con unos buenos ingresos de su tienda el se los pueda ofrecer. Adem\u00e1s, Carlos Mario tiene el sue\u00f1o de montar un gran supermercado en el cual pueda generar mucho empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas.\n","en":"Entrepreneurial and visionary are the words that best describe Carlos Mario, a person that in spite of that fact that he doesn't come from a wealthy family has had the strength to get ahead and gibe his parents a better quality of life.\r\nCarlos Mario used to work at a dressmaking shop, but he didn't want to continue to work there because he didn't get paid well. Since then he started a general store, in which he only sold vegetables at the beginning.  Because Carlos Mario knew how to manage his money, he saved most of the income and re-invested it in the business and now he also sells basic groceries.  Carlos Mario now has small savings and hopes to buy display cabinets to show his products at the store.  However, he doesn't have enough money to buy them and also buy merchandise to stock the store, so he hopes a loan gives him the access to a display cabinet and to buy basic groceries to stock it.  Carlos Mario hopes that this way his sales will increase considerably, because the store will be more presentable to his clients, who will be able to find a larger variety of products.  Carlos Mario dreams to see his parents enjoy a better quality of life and hopes that with the good income form the store he can offer this to them.  He also hopes one day to be able to own a supermarket and employ people with needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":996207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

With his family Hector hopes to give them a better quality of life and better education so that in the future they can access a university education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":996201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a refrigerator to store cold cuts for sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T03:10:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hector Dario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87945},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90428},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92980},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95605},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98303},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101078},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103931},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106865},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109881},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112984}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.11},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.18},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.51,"local_amount":86102,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":89363.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075620},{"amount":50.9,"local_amount":88524,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":91876.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902351},{"amount":53.41,"local_amount":92894,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":96412.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283326715},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":95294,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":98903.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432104},{"amount":56.06,"local_amount":97502,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":101194.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378144},{"amount":60.97,"local_amount":106023,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":110038.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301432762},{"amount":56.58,"local_amount":98402,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":102128.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617254},{"amount":61.33,"local_amount":106664,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":110703.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315640200},{"amount":66.48,"local_amount":115611,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":119989.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323029268},{"amount":61.48,"local_amount":106927,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":110976.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165445},{"amount":3.49,"local_amount":6057,"processed_date":"2013-02-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T16:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":6286.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339548969}],"funded_date":"2012-03-02T06:50:43Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T16:20:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":388541,"name":"Darisuren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Darisuren is 49 years old and lives with her husband in western Mongolia.

He has worked raising chickens for ten years.  He began helping a neighbor who was doing this work.  Then his neighbor gave him 50 chickens on credit so he could fatten them and sell them by the pound.  Later he got together with his mother and they bought more than 100 chickens, quartered them, and sold them.\r\n\r\nCurrently Wilian is raising chickens every six weeks, which are the days of production.  He sells 500 pounds already delivered.  He has his customers, among whom he supplies a hotel and stores in various communities.  He buys 110 chickens in a city that is 56 miles from where he lives, and manages to get 100 five-pound chickens.  To buy the chickens he has to leave the house at 6:00 a.m., walk three-and-a-half kilometers, and board a vehicle that drives him to the city where he buys the chickens.  He buys them once a week along with the feed to feed them.  During farming season Wilian works growing basic grains to sell and also works as the assistant of a bricklayer.\r\n\r\nWilian is requesting the loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy 125 more chickens and feed to feed those he already has and those he will buy, because the demand is growing.  Once they reach their weight he quarters them, cleans them, and sells them by the pound.  He also will expand the farm for at least 50 more chickens.  In this way he will receive greater income, because he will supply all his customers and meet the demand.  With this income he will give his family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nHe plans to work very hard raising the chickens and work only on this, since this is the work from which he gets the most income.  He also wants to construct his own house because he lives in his mother's house.  He already has the plot of land; he only needs to build.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":990773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 125 more chickens and feed to feed them, and to expand the farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T06:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T06:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilian Alexander","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":54.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":58.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.6,"local_amount":48.6,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":48.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317587},{"amount":49.06,"local_amount":49.06,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":49.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033152},{"amount":43.13,"local_amount":43.13,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":43.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645372},{"amount":50.46,"local_amount":50.46,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491815},{"amount":48.19,"local_amount":48.19,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":48.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736354},{"amount":48.95,"local_amount":48.95,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":48.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561638},{"amount":189.34,"local_amount":189.34,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390759},{"amount":26.29,"local_amount":26.29,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":26.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315382967},{"amount":47.44,"local_amount":47.44,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":47.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322990054},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":48.54,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":48.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331970373}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T14:09:33Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:34:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":388580,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martin is 32 years old and lives in the town of Tororo in the Mbale region of Uganda.

One is 10 years old and about to start fifth grade; a 7-year-old daughter will start first grade. The smallest of his children is 7 months old. They live in the house his mother-in-law left them. Juan's wife has a small business in their home selling enchiladas and enredos (snack food made from fried yuca).\r\n\r\nJuan is a farmer, but at the present time he is working in construction. He says that he farms because he has always liked it. But he realized that he earned more income, more quickly, doing construction. \r\n\r\nSo he started to learn from the age of 12. His father taught him this trade. Now 32, he says he likes the construction trade better, and in this way he can work with his siblings and his father. In the beginning, he did every job with his father's help, as he was the one who had the tools. \r\n\r\nAs time went on, Juan saved money and started buying his materials, tools, and work equipment. That's why he no longer depends so much on his father, and does jobs independently.

identifica una tienda y miscel\u00e1nea a la vez, pues en \u00e9l  sus clientes encuentran desde panes, pudines,  refrescos y en general pocas cantidades de art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n perfumes, ropa informal, chancletas etc. En su negocio Carmen vende a cr\u00e9dito y principalmente de contado a una clientela ubicada alrededor de su barrio, porque  se encuentra en una avenida muy reconocida, por ser un gran corredor comercial y esto potencializa su mercado. Con este negocio ella  ha logrado su crecimiento personal, el fortalecimiento de su autonom\u00eda y tambi\u00e9n la generaci\u00f3n  de sus ingresos para el sostenimiento familiar, formada por sus dos hijas mayores, que la apoyan y siempre han sido su fuente de inspiraci\u00f3n para trabajar persistentemente y salir adelante.  Su meta mas adelante es tener un local separado de la vivienda, para disfrutar de su sosiego familiar. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es tener el suficiente capital de trabajo para responder a su creciente clientela que permanentemente hace pedidos. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 dulces, bebidas y refrescos, aprovechando que se acera una temporada de festividades y son los productos que mas se venden, lo cual garantiza el \u00e9xito de la inversi\u00f3n. Carmen en su negocio tiene una rentabilidad sobre las ventas no menores del 22%, una rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar de 8 d\u00edas y de inventarios tambi\u00e9n cada 8 d\u00edas, \u00edndices financieros desde los cuales se planea su crecimiento. ","en":"Carmen is 58 years old and lives in the southwest part of the city, where she has her business. She identifies her business as both a grocery and a miscellaneous goods store, since her customers find everything from breads, puddings, soda pop, and, generally, small quantities of items necessary for everyday living, as well as perfume, casual clothing, and sandals, etc. In her business, Carmen sells on credit and principally in cash to customers located nearby in her neighborhood, since she is located on a well-recognized avenue, a large commercial corridor, which provides her with a good market. With this business she has achieved personal growth, strengthened her autonomy, and also generated revenue to sustain her family, which is made up of two grown daughters who support her and have always been her source of inspiration to work persistently and to get ahead. Her future goal is to have a shop separate from her home so she may enjoy a calm home. Her greatest challenge is to have sufficient working capital to respond to her growing customer base which always makes orders. This is the reason for which she has turned to her first Kiva loan, the first loan she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [Mario Santo Domingo Foundation]. She will purchase sweets, drinks, and soda pop with the loan, taking advantage of the coming festival season by stocking the items she sells the most, which will guarantee a successful investment. Carmen has a 22% retail sales profit in her business, her account charge cycle is eight days, and her restocking cycle is also eight days. From these financial indicators she has planned her business growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":997268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She divides her time between making items of clothing, and selling 3 different types of goods. Her main business is the dressmaking, an activity she has been doing in the 20 years since she learned this art. She started out making bespoke dresses to the measurements of her friends and neighbours, and with the income from that she gradually expanded her range and her client base. She began offering beauty products and other goods that slowly took precedence. Her dream of growth is still with her, and she wants to increase her client base once more, but her working capital is not enough to respond to her customers' demands. This is her reason for seeking a Kiva loan, her first finance from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will buy fabric and notions, clothes, and cosmetics, along with such other merchandise as she can get at a good discount through the catalogues and that her customers have requested her to get at the best price. Her goal is to succeed in growing her income, to improve her wellbeing and that of her family each day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997288,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric and notions, clothes, and cosmetics, among other merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T08:03:28Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T08:03:28Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69284},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74789},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76534},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78320},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80148},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82018},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83932},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85890},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87894},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89945},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92044},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":69284,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72266.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325142},{"amount":43,"local_amount":74789,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78008.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039221},{"amount":44.01,"local_amount":76534,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":79828.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140959},{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":78320,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81691.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100852},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":80148,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83598.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338475},{"amount":95.42,"local_amount":165950,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":173094.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395043},{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":85890,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":89587.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386855},{"amount":50.54,"local_amount":87894,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":91677.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993729},{"amount":51.71,"local_amount":89945,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T13:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":93817.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331130109},{"amount":109.97,"local_amount":191246,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T15:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":199479.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339519020}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T22:37:44Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T15:25:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":383359,"name":"Chantha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chantha is a weaver, while her husband, Rayot, is a construction worker.

Her goal is to have a well-stocked, reputable shop in her neighborhood that everyone would know about because of its variety of merchandise.  Currently she sells items on a credit basis to select customers who have been loyal for some time.  She also sells on a cash basis when beginning a commercial relationship with shoppers.  Lately, Carmela has added a line of beauty products, cosmetics perfumes and varied merchandise that her customers order, which is doing very well.  \r\n\r\nShe wants to buy more of this type of merchandise but does not have enough working capital to respond to new customers.  So she is requesting a Credikiva loan, her first, through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, which she will use to buy perfumes, cosmetics, and women's and children's accessories.  She believes this investment will be successful because it is based on orders made by potential customers who have been referred to her by good customers, and which she will handle with much care.  Carmela's accounts receivable turnover is 15 days and her inventory turnover is 12 days, with a profit over sales of no less than 38%, financial data in line with this type of business and which she

That is why she is now putting forth great effort to get her business ahead.\r\n\r\nLiliana waits on customers in a restaurant in her municipality.  When she finishes her work day she makes desserts that she distributes to some restaurants in the municipality.  Her desserts are known for their good flavor and for the good quality of service that she offers.  This is why, little by little, her sales have been increasing considerably.\r\n\r\nAs Liliana makes the desserts manually or by hand, she does not have a large production.  That is why she has not been able to take care of the large orders that some of her customers are making lately.  With the aim of being able to increase production of her desserts, Liliana is looking to buy an industrial blender.  This will allow her to make the process more industrialized, and she will be able to speed up production.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lilian does not have enough capital to buy this machine.  That is why she has the hope that a loan will give her the possibility of buying an industrial blender, which will allow her to make more desserts in less time.\r\n\r\nLiliana hopes that her income increases and that she will be able to take care of customers that she previously could not.

He is thirty-eight years old and lives with his family: his wife \u2013 Rosa, two sons (10 and 8 years old) and his parents who are retired. The only source of the income for the family is a dairy farm. Rosa produces and sells cheese on the local market. The total average monthly income of the family is 600 Laris, including the pensions of Aluda\u2019s parents. \r\n\r\nAluda requested credit for re-starting a family business. The family has a small bakery, which used to be used for production of confectionery products. The problem which caused the bakery to close a couple of years ago was the lack of clients in the village. If Aluda could take the products to neighboring districts and villages, he could sell them. \r\n\r\nAluda requested credit to purchase a small mini-bus to transport the bakery products. He will sell them to the grocery shops in nearby villages. Also he will sell through the same channels their cheese for a higher price. \r\n\r\nStarting up this business again will significantly increase the income of the family. They will be able to purchase additional household goods, to improve their living

He is an internally displaced person (IDP) from the town of Fuzuli and currently lives in the Fuzuli region with his loving family.  Djahid has been owning a cafe in the Fuzuli region for two years.  He currently needs 2,000 AZN to buy new tables and chairs for his cafe, in order to accommodate more clients.  This is his second loan.  He wishes to thank his lenders and Kiva for his first loan.

Before that he was a welder but an eye disease meant that he had to give up that work. Thanks to his current job he can earn enough money to support his household.\r\n\r\nGustavo has loyal customers largely because of the good service he provides and for that reason his business is becoming more well known. There was a time when he had to take out a loan, but his business was failing leaving him with no profits to take home. Now that he has been able to terminate that prohibitively expensive loan, he wishes to increase the number of products to offer his customers. He is seeking a loan which will allow him to buy candy and snacks to better stock his cart with a wider variety of items.\r\n\r\nGustavo hopes to be able to make his business successful once again as he has been very poor since that very difficult time. He hopes to see sales increase and allow him to improve his quality of life and have a stable income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 6h00 hasta las 22h00 y a veces hasta m\u00e1s tarde cuando tiene pedidos que entregar, lleva m\u00e1s de 15 a\u00f1os dedicada a esta profesi\u00f3n.\n\nNos cuenta que en el cr\u00e9dito anterior todo marcho con mucha normalidad y que le fue muy bien, en cu\u00e1nto a los pagos estuvo al d\u00eda en todos los pagos y no tuvo ninguna complicaci\u00f3n.\n\nEst\u00e1 repitiendo el cr\u00e9dito ya que todos los cr\u00e9ditos que ha recibido del banco le han ayudado mucho en su negocio y en su vida personal ya que sola ella tiene que solventar los gastos que generan sus hijos y su hogar, el cr\u00e9dito le sirvi\u00f3 para mejorar su negocio y con las ganancias que tuvo pudo cubrir ciertos gastos que generaron los estudios de su hija en la universidad, este nuevo cr\u00e9dito es para  comprar telas, hilos, botones y otros materiales para la costura. Ella es socia fundadora del Banco Comunal, es la presidenta y le gusta porque el grupo es muy unido y responsable.\n \nSus sue\u00f1os son seguir adelante en su taller de costura y que su hija sea una gran profesional.\n\n\n\n","en":"In the municipal fortress of the city of Portoviejo, the capital of Manab\u00ed, (known for many years as \"The City of the Royal Tamarind Trees\"), the members of the New Star Community Bank for Development meet every two weeks. Here we meet Se\u00f1ora Mariana. She is 55 years old, and a single mother of three children; two of them are grown and the third is an 18 year old girl who studies at the university. All her children still live at home. Several years ago she took tailoring classes in a local academy. \r\n\r\nIn order to help her children get ahead, she started a small sewing shop in her home nine years ago, where she works sewing all kinds of clothes. She works from specific orders placed by individuals who come to her shop to have their clothes made. She tells us that what she makes most is sleepwear. She works based on orders from individuals and also delivers the garments she makes to bazaars\u200b\u200b. She works every day from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., and sometimes even later when she has orders to deliver. She has worked in this profession for more than 15 years. \r\n\r\nShe told us that with her last loan everything went smoothly and that it turned out well. She was current on all her payments and there were no complications. She is repeating the loan because all of the loans that she has received from the bank have helped her greatly with her business and with her personal life. Since she has the responsibility to cover the costs of her home and for her children, the loan helped her to improve her business and with the profits she was able to cover certain costs associated with her daughter studying to the university. This new loan will be used to buy fabric, thread, buttons and other materials for sewing. \r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the communal bank and the president; she likes the group because it is very united and responsible. Her dreams are to continue moving forward with her sewing shop and that her daughter will be a great professional.

She is single and comfortably lives in the family house with her father, mother and siblings whom she deeply loves.\r\n\r\nLoty sells clothes of various models and all types. The work in this business is a seasonal activity. She sends money to her sister in Lima who buys the clothes requested by Loty's customers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand she has a grocery store at home to serve her neighbors and passers-by. During the three years in her grocery she could always rely on her mother to attend the store. She likes her business since it generates an income to pay for her personal needs and help her parents with household expenses. She is also able to regularly save some money.\r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to buy her own house and become independent, as well as open another store. This is her second loan with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma and she expects to continue her collaboration with this institution to pursue her goals. She also feels at ease when dealing with her communal bank because in her opinion it is a responsible group. Loty will invest the 800 new soles of her loan in her store and buy groceries at wholesale prices.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":997420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy goods for her grocery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loty ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":143.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":155.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":164.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.82},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.66,"local_amount":143.08,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":144.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386427},{"amount":58.2,"local_amount":155.2,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":156.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099524},{"amount":60.63,"local_amount":161.7,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":163.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713669},{"amount":32.66,"local_amount":87.1,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":87.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202557},{"amount":94.85,"local_amount":252.92,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098242}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T20:17:28Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":387607,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana, es comerciante de ropa, vive acompa\u00f1ada de su esposo y tres hijos, ella se dedica a la venta de ropa de manera ambulante, estas ventas las realiza todos los d\u00edas  sin un horario fijo.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de camisas, blusas, ropa interior de damas y caballeros, con esta inversi\u00f3n aumentara el inventario de los productos, ayud\u00e1ndole a generar mayores ingresos.\nEl objetivo de Ana es comprar en un futuro un veh\u00edculo para transportar la mercader\u00eda, por lo pronto desea continuar en el negocio siendo prospero. \n","en":"\r\nAna is a clothes merchant.

She lives in a residential area very close to the sea with her husband and her three children who range from 16 years. She sells cheese, cold meats and also products through specialized catalogs, such as perfumes and cosmetics, on credit. Her sales are made with select customers, for whom she looks for the best prices, for the sake of keeping them faithful.\n\nHer business idea began 3 years ago, 15 years after having arrived from Sinc\u00e9 in the department of Sucre to work providing services in various offices in the city of Barranquilla. With a loan that she made through her mother, in order to work independently, she began to sell cheese and cold meats through the distribution system among her friends, relatives and neighbors, and so it was that her income began to increase and she was able to add other products that her customers needed. \n\nMarta has her own house. She is very hard working working, and occasionally she does various jobs for businesses at an hourly wage. Her husband services motorcycles from home and both manage the household. \n\nCurrently she is asking for her first Kiva loan, and also her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy packages of meat, cheese by the kilo, and products through catalogs that come with special discounts so she can fulfill the requests of her customers.

She\u2019s the mother of three children: Juan Carlos, 24, Milton, 22 and Ana, 19.  Sadly, her husband abandoned her with three children when they were still minors so she had to work twice as hard to provide them with a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s work consists in selling second-hand clothes.  During a certain amount of time she heads to the various settlements, towns and communities along the Ucayali River to sell clothes in exchange for money and on some occasions for grains or animals.  She\u2019s been in this business for 15 years and it\u2019s been very useful for her in that she was able to provide education and food for her children who are now adults and contribute to the home\u2019s economy.  She feels that she\u2019s doing well because since she\u2019s gotten to know many people and several communities throughout the years she knows just where to go every time she goes out and she has customers who anxiously await her to buy the clothes she brings.  She hopes to continue working to see her business progress even more and later on start to sell new clothes.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first MFP loan.  She\u2019s very happy to have financial support that will allow her to increase her working capital.  She knows that she\u2019ll have to be very responsible and above all very punctual.  She will use the requested amount of 800 soles to buy bundles of second-hand clothes to once again head out to the hamlets and continue selling her articles of clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":997544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more second-hand clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":127.97},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":127.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":142.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":145.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.7,"local_amount":119.19,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":120.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386434},{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":127.97,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":129.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099531},{"amount":47.8,"local_amount":127.49,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":128.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713674},{"amount":51.57,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:29Z","rounded_local_amount":138.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202564},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":142.23,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":143.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098248},{"amount":54.61,"local_amount":145.62,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":146.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401035}],"funded_date":"2012-02-06T21:41:33Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":388855,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia, age 51, runs an eatery shop or food shop where she sells chicken and pork barbecue meals and grilled hotdogs.

Hair styling is in his blood, Jesse said, as he comes from a family of hair stylists. Before birth, his aunt owned and operated a salon that has now been in business for about 50 years. \"I've always wanted to work for myself and just kind of make my mom proud,\" he said. \"That was my goal though I began as a cook.\"\r\n\r\nJesse sensed there was a lack of knowledge and a pool of stylists attempting non-chemical treatments, so he made it top priority to go to school and change his career. Non-chemical does not mean that he does not know how to dye hair or care for chemically treated hair. His business niche is to work with such natural hair styles as dread locks, which he has been doing for 30 years, braids, corn rows, teasing, and the like. \r\n\r\nJesse had done business in Louisiana since 1996 until Hurricane Katrina devastated the state in 2005 and prompted him to re-locate to Texas. So he's especially appreciative of the lending assistance he received from ACCION Texas Inc., as he found re-starting his business in a different state was a complicated endeavor. \r\n\r\nHe employs 11 hair stylists and plans to hire more within the next year. In order to do that though, he will need a larger building in Austin's downtown. This, he said, may necessitate another loan. For the time being, Jesse is using the money to replace two styling chairs, purchase two TVs (which his clients have requested), and use the rest for marketing. The loan from ACCION Texas allows him to respond to clients' requests and recommendations. \"It's all about them,\" he said. \r\n\r\nCheck out his websites at: www.jaeundreas.net, www.jaeundreas.com

He resells medicines for a more profitable price in his home city. \r\n\r\nDue to the bad situation in Yemen, he faced a financial challenge in his demand.\r\n\r\nSo, he took a loan of 100,000 Yemeni Rial (YER) from AMB in order to supply his business with good medicines and keep his customers coming back. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to expand his business to open another pharmacy.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":999827,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy good medicines and keep his customers coming back","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Taiz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohammed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":10018},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":9998},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":9998}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.49},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.59,"local_amount":10018,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":10171.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269957067},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563344},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050489},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072030},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266901},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320239},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341173},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315310532},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:23:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322918866},{"amount":47.49,"local_amount":9998,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T11:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10151.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331051140}],"funded_date":"2012-02-07T02:48:37Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T11:26:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":388987,"name":"Sean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"From Kompong Cham Province, Sean, a loving mother of seven children, has been cultivating rice crops to make a living.

","en":"Miguel is 65 years old and a native of an area that is rich in natural beauty with spectacular countryside, where the people very warm and friendly, and where the dress and the language of the Mazahua culture are common. Miguel has been buying sheep and calves for more than 15 years, and he says that things are going very well with the calf sales and especially in December during Christmas celebrations. He says that in the cold months he has to be very careful with his animals because they get sick due to the heavy frosts that befall the area. Miguel says that the loan will help him since thanks to this he can buy another 2 calves, and he will increase his income a little more. With this he will be able to have a nice New Year\u2019s dinner and invite his children and grandchildren, who are his joy, to his home. One of his business goals is to increase the number of animals to be able to sell them in other parts of the state and to move as he sees fit. He says that, thanks to the funding, his business has grown little by little since previously he didn\u2019t have animals to sell.

29 years old, married, and has a daughter and a son, both of preschool age. The family lives in the village Ak-Suu in the Moskovsky region. Lidiya was born and grew up in the village Belovodskoye, in a family of farmers. After graduating from high school, she entered the Pedagogical Institute in the city of Bishkek, where she became acquainted with her future husband Sergej. In 2003, when she was starting her third year, they got married. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning the couple lived in a rented apartment in Bishkek. After having finished the education, they moved to the village Belovodskoye, to Lidiya's relatives. Lidiya explains that her parents gave them a cow for the wedding, so they started their first business. Over time they started to expand their farm - Lidiya's husband became engaged in field crop cultivation, taking three hectares of irrigated land to start growing crops and alfalfa. \r\n\r\nIn the village Belovodskoye, there is a small dairy factory, which takes milk from the local population and produce products such as butter, cheese, cottage cheese, cream and so on. For over more than five years, Lidiya has cooperated with this factory and delivered milk to them. Thanks to the revenue from the milk, Lidiya and her husband expanded their business - they have now rented an additional five hectares of land, where they grow sugar beets and potatoes, which gives a good profit for the family. \r\n\r\nThanks to persistent work, Lidiya's family was able to buy a small house with a barn in the village Ak-Suu in 2007, where they keep six cows, three horses and four bulls. In order to further develop her business, Lidiya turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 130,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional livestock. In the near future, Lidiya plans to increase the revenue from selling milk, and use the income to increase the number of livestock. In the future, Lidiya plans to expand the farm, to have the opportunity to provide her children with education at a good university."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":1000385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Ak-Suu village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-02-06T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-07T21:40:03Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidiya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":43000},{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":44000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":926.15},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":926.16},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":947.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":926.15,"local_amount":43000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":43372.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285482},{"amount":926.16,"local_amount":43000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":43372.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459406},{"amount":947.69,"local_amount":44000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":44381.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381631373}],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T11:20:11Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T09:12:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":389064,"name":"Abraham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thirty-five-year-old Abraham is married to Julia and is blessed with two children aged seven and five.

A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

In the beginning, he launched his business selling oysters on the streets of the city. Later, he began to familiarize himself with fishing in the river, and worked at that. But the increasing difficulties that arose made him stop this, and just work buying and selling fish such as bocachico, mullet, corvina, and goatfish.\r\n\r\nWhen he started his retail business, he invested a small amount of capital and attracted a few customers among his friends and people very close to his family.  With his effort, his business started to grow, and now he he has more than 60 independent buyers. He also sells to restaurants and takes orders from customers. \r\n\r\nIn the morning he takes the fish around, and collects the money in the afternoon hours. He also has customers living nearby, who buy from him at his home and often place orders with him. He purchases directly from the fishermen, with whom he has established an effective business relationship.\r\n\r\nFernando has a passion for this work, because through it he has managed to support his family, own his own house, and to use his knowledge of fresh fish. His goal is to eventually have a fish store, where he can keep his fish, and sell them at a very well-known place by the river.

She is married and has no children yet. Her husband is employed, but gets a low salary that is not enough to cover life's costs.\n \nEman is requesting a youth loan from FATEN to help her cover the cost of purchasing necessary home furniture such as living room seats, dining room furniture, etc., in order to improve the house's condition. This will offer to Eman and her husband better and suitable home living conditions.\n\nEman is a conservative person who prefers not to have her photo published online, so her husband, Shareef, appears in her Kiva profile photo.\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

Adelat is 28 years old. He is not married. \r\n\r\nAdelat has owned his store, where he sells food, for two years already. Currently, he needs 2000 AZN in order to purchase products for sale, and thus develop his business. He learnt this business from his grandfather, who also owned his own store.

Her beauty salon is well-known in the sector because of the good service Leidy provides and thanks to this she\u2019s seen her sales increase considerably the last few months.\r\n\r\nRecently, Leidy has had very little economic capacity due to various problems her parents have had.  However, she\u2019s been able to continue going forward with her business and not stop her activity.  Hoping to be able to buy needed supplies for her beauty salon, Leidy is hoping for a loan that will make it possible for her to buy supplies for the beauty salon like nail polish remover and nail polish, among others.\r\n\r\nLeidy hopes that in this way she will be able to continue exercising her activity and that her own business will continue growing more each time.  Leidy dreams with her beauty salon growing and with being able to hire other people who need to earn income; she also dreams with her parents being able to enjoy a better quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":998021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty
