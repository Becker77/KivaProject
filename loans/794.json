He is asking for a loan of 15,000 griven. Heated greenhouses will allow Igor to get his harvest faster and be able to sell it for a higher price. Previously Igor had taken out a loan to build a greenhouse addition for growing seedlings.\r\n\r\nIgor's business has been expanding. Two years ago his annual farming profits were only 36,000 griven. Since that he has began growing vegetables on a professional scale by planting better, more expensive varieties and using new fertilizer mixes. As a result his annual profits doubled. Igor has used the profits to put a new fence and gate around his house, perform home improvements and repairs his car.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":668082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Three years ago she began working as a street food vendor, but because her necessity increased, she decided to venture into a business with a food stall. For this she bought better ingredients, like fresh meat, tables, chairs and converted part of their home into an area to receive guests. She enjoys what she does and was able to adapt quickly to the work because she has always liked to cook, and with her sales she is able to generate income. Now she has many customers but doesn't have a large enough facility to accommodate all of them. She would like to enlarge her business so it will grow. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan she has taken out with MFP.

Mateo and the other members of her group strive each day to conduct their business activities in their community so that they can improve their incomes. They also motivate other women to engage in their own businesses so that they can help their families get ahead.\r\n\r\nMateo manages a butcher shop where she sells different types of meat such as chicken, beef, and pork. She has been in business for several years and also sells bacon, sausages, and salted meats. Mateo started her business because she needed to generate income for her family. She is receiving her third loan and will invest by purchasing beef, pork, and other ingredients. \r\n\r\nShe is the mother of one child who she raises along with her husband.

She has started a business as a mobile money transfer agent in her home city of Chingola in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia.\n\nConstance\u2019s biggest dream is to expand her business beyond her home town. She intends to be able to handle huge sums of money as this will enable her to have more profits. However, Constance faces the challenge of having little capital for her business. This means that she cannot conduct transfers that require large sums of money to be received or sent. When she gets the loan, she intends to increase her working capital so that she will be able to handle bigger transfers of money. When she has grown her business, Constance wants to go to college while continuing to run her business.\n\nConstance is convinced that her business is helping her community because many do not know how to read and write and her money transfers do not require complicated paperwork. Also, she provides personalized services so her customers always get all the help they need. This, she believes, is the competitive edge that her business has that will help make enough profits to realize her dream of going to college \n\nIn this Video, Constance is being interviewed by a

Her husband employed, but does not enough to cover the family's needs. For the past two years, Mariam's husband has also been driving a taxi, which has been a profitable project.\n\nMariam is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her husband cover the costs of making some necessary repairs to the taxi such as painting, changing the engine, etc., in order to improve the taxi's condition. This will increase the taxi's efficiency and ability to take more requests, which will improve the family's income.\n\nAbout this loan product:\n\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0 percent interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

He is a herdsman on a collective farm, and his sheep flock counts over a hundred of animals.  Abdumalik has been raising livestock for over 40 years. His two sons are currently working in Russia.

This is a very active city, because of the influx of tourists who come daily to see the ancient Nazca Lines.  It is also a city that is seeing increasing mining, farming and commercial activities, which are turning this area into one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the southern part of Peru.  Oscar really enjoys the Peruvian cuisine; one of his favorite dishes is the \"Lomo Saltado\" (a traditional Peruvian beef dish.)  In his free time, he really enjoys listening to music, most of all when he has a problem or is in a bad mood, because this relaxes him.  Oscar only has a 5th grade education, but he would have liked to have gotten a university degree.  Oscar is married, and with his wife he has 2 wonderful children, aged 9 and 7, who are both in elementary school.  He really adores them, and they are the driving force behind his life.  He says that without them, he would be nothing, because they are the greatest gift that God has given him.\r\n\r\nOscar works providing taxi services to the residents of his city.  He goes around the streets looking for passengers to whom he can offer his services.  He works about 8 hours a day, during which time he provides services to up to 20 passengers.  But when it is a festival day, he can service up to 50 customers.  He believes that his business is doing well because of all the effort he puts in so that he can get ahead and provide the best for his family.\r\n\r\nOscar is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because with their help he will be able to do maintenance work on his vehicle.  This will permit him to drive a safer vehicle and avoid having it malfunction.  In this way his customers will be safer and will have more confidence in using his services.  With this improvement, he will have more income and will be able to save toward his main dreams, which are \"to provide a good education to his children and to buy himself another vehicle.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":998179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

Ida has been in business for 10 years and has become well-known since her food is in demand.  She manages the business with the help of her daughers-in-law.  Ida enjoys this business because she is able to generate a financial income to support herself and help with the household expenses.

La ubicaci\u00f3n del negocio es muy estrat\u00e9gica ya que se encuentra en el centro de la ciudad donde ella reside, lugar que es muy concurrido y visitado. \u00daltimamente ha estado notando que la demanda de sus ricos panes ha aumentado y muchas veces se queda escasa de producto. Esto la ha llevado a tomar la decisi\u00f3n de solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en su negocio en la compra de insumos  (frijoles, pan dulce, pan franc\u00e9s, huevos, caf\u00e9, etc.) que le permitan cubrir una mayor demanda y de esta manera espera obtener mayores ingresos que le permitan mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia. \n","en":"37-year-old Ana Dolores lives in a house that she owns together with her life partner and her adult son.  Her business is selling coffee, sweet bread, egg sandwiches, bean sandwiches, 'atol' (a corn-based hot drink), etc.  She has been in this business for approximately 11 years and, thanks to God and her own efforts, she has managed to keep it running.  This has allowed her to provide her household with their daily bread as her husband's income is not enough to cover the cost of their main necessities which become more and more expensive.  \r\n\r\nAna Dolores is very well known in her area as she always offers good-quality products at good prices.  As far as she is concerned, the most important thing is for her customers to be happy with her service.  Her business is in a very strategic location, in the city center, where she lives.  This area is very busy and has lots of visitors. \r\n\r\nAna Dolores has recently noticed that the demand for her delicious breads has risen and she often runs out.  For this reason, she has taken the decision to request a loan from INTEGRAL, to invest in her business, buying supplies (beans, sweet bread, French bread, eggs, coffee, etc.) that will enable her to cope with higher levels of demand.  In this way, she hopes to make more income which will allow her to improve her own quality of life as well as that of her

Sobhya wants to replace the old refrigerator she has with a new one, and since her salary is not enough to afford this, she is requesting a loan from FATEN to help her cover the costs of purchasing the new refrigerator for her house and providing her family with healthy living conditions. Sobhya is pictured above, at a FATEN branch.\n\n\nAbout this loan product:\nFATEN offers loans that are customized for Muslim borrowers. A key principle of Islam is the prohibition of charging interest on a loan. This prohibition is based on the belief that money is only a medium of exchange and has no value in itself. In order to offer loans in a manner that is consistent with borrowers' values, FATEN charges 0% interest on this loan. However, FATEN does charge a servicing fee to cover its costs. The loan amount you see listed on Kiva includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you according to this loan\u2019s repayment schedule.

She is involved in retail, and she sells clothes, incense and cosmetic products.  She was introduced to this activity while helping her mother with her business, and she has since gained a three-year experience in this field.  With her revenues, she is able to take care of her own needs.  She has been a member of one of the UIMCEC branches since April 2011.  She is requesting a loan of 350,000 francs which will be used to pay for an order of shea (butter) and to purchase heavy clothes for resale.  She has already paid back a previous loan to the institution.  The profits generated by her business have allowed her to expand her activity: she has been able to buy some incense which she has sent for resale to another region in Senegal."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":996243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for an order of shea (butter) to purchase heavy clothes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2012-02-07T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-08T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wagne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.67},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":29166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":30055.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270147617},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":30055.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276767390},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":30055.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283411920},{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":29166.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":30055.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287817459},{"amount":120.83,"local_amount":58333.02,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:58:26Z","rounded_local_amount":60111.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301517734},{"amount":36.62,"local_amount":17676.98,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":18215.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308860873},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":25334,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-18T10:25:59Z","rounded_local_amount":26106.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323609644},{"amount":39.57,"local_amount":19104,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-24T10:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":19686.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331715478},{"amount":233.83,"local_amount":112885,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":116326.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381832645}],"funded_date":"2012-02-23T10:19:17Z","paid_date":"2013-07-17T12:00:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":386423,"name":"Khadra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khadra, a 61-year-old divorced woman, is living with her son in a rented house. \r\n\r\nAlthough she is living with her son, she chose to do something so she can support herself and help in paying the rent with her son.

Nonetheless, he doesn't have enough capital right now to do it. That is why he requests a youth loan of 200,000 YER from AMB. The loan will allow him to buy basic products such as rice, sugar, flour, beans and soft drinks to offer in his business and thus increase his sales. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Shawgy hopes that with the

This is why she has the hope that a loan will afford her the opportunity to buy personal care products for her business like lotions, creams, shampoo and make-up, among other things, that she hopes will make her customers return. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Amal dreams that her business will continue to provide income in order to help her family with the household income, and that way, provide a better quality of life.

The business location is separate from her residence. She has been running the business for more than 10 years. Martha usually buys chicks and fodder from the supplier; she needs two weeks to raise the chicks and sell them to the customer.  \r\n\r\nMartha intends to buy more chicks to be raised since recently hundreds of chicks died because of disease. She was so sad about the situation but she did not despair. She wants to restart the business. Now she needs capital to do so, therefore she is requesting a loan from TLM amounting to IDR 3,000,000. She plans to spend the loan on chicks and fodder. Martha is hoping that her loan application will be approved by TLM soon.

She lives with her family which consists of her husband and their two young children.  The couple care for the children in their own home.  Soledad fell pregnant at a young age but she doesn't feel disappointed at all as she had the strength and courage to grow, work and give her life direction.  Her children are the greatest treasure that she has.  For this reason, she wants to do well and be successful so that she can provide them with a good quality of life.  They are still young and she is already saving up.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning, Soledad goes out to sell fodder near her home.  All the people in her community know her and they know how hard-working and tenacious she is.  For this reason, they do not hesitate to buy feed from her for their animals.  In the afternoons, Soledad goes out to her farmland where she cuts the alfalfa that she will sell the following day.  She says that she has to buy entire plots of land sown with alfalfa.  Her plans are to increase the quality of her fodder and to sell it wholesale as she knows that she must think big if she wants to do well in life.\r\n\r\nThis is Soledad's second loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her aims.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time.  Soledad enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible and supportive people.  With your support, Soledad will invest the money she has requested in buying more plots of land sown with alfalfa to stock her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":998806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He likes to be a livestock farmer very much and he confesses that each time he can, he asks for assistance from the technicians and engineers who buy his animals for their projects.  Now he can choose the best bid because they not only buy his animals, but he also takes them to livestock markets in the city where he can supply his stock by not having to buy more animals from the animal dealers in his community.  His wife also sells milk and makes cheese that she sells in the same community to the visitors who come.\r\nHe belongs to the united group \u201cLos Huari\u00f1oz\u201d and this is his fourth loan with MFP.

The two have 4 children that they care for in their own house.  During the day she performs diverse activities.  In the morning she is dedicated to washing and ironing typical petticoats in a well known store of her city.  There she obtains a monthly income.  In the afternoons, after feeding her smaller animals, among them guinea pigs, chickens, hogs and ducks, she harvests potatoes or any food that the farmers sow that are mature and ready to be taken from the land.  Her husband also works as a operative or laborer in diverse sown fields, just like her.  But her main economic activity is the breeding of guinea pigs, which she takes care of with a lot of dedication and personal concern.  Her secret is to feed them with elaborate grasses concentrated with first quality vitamins that she herself devises.  This permits her to have healthy animals with a high amount of vitamins and proteins.  Now at the festivals they remain without compare, therefore she sells almost all of them.  Because of this, her project is to enlarge the quantity of guinea pigs.  She belongs to the supportive group called  \"walking toward the future\" and this is her fifth loan with MFP.  With its contribution, she hopes to continue with her objectives.  She also promises once more to comply with the payment schedule.   It pleases her to be part of her association because all their members are supportive and responsible people.  On receiving  this support, Ysabel will invest the requested money in the purchase of more guinea pigs and chickens to enlarge her profits.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":998825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy guinea pigs and chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jauja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.8 -75.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-08T02:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-09T02:30:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":201.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099541},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":201.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713683},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":201.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202574},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":201.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098258},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":201.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401042},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":201.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455531}],"funded_date":"2012-02-08T06:29:39Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":388308,"name":"La Hermosa Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ingar Domenica es casada, tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, curs\u00f3 los 6 a\u00f1os de educaci\u00f3n primaria, tiene 4 hijos los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de pantalones y blusas, inici\u00f3 este negocio con una peque\u00f1a maquina de costura, y hasta ahora  lleva 15 a\u00f1os de experiencia, cuenta con el apoyo de su esposo quien se dedica al comercio a la venta de ropa.\n\nOrganiza un grupo para poder solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que  los utilizara para la compra de telas de diferentes clase ya que quiere incrementar su producci\u00f3n de pantalones y blusas, espera en el futuro tener una maquila.

Their children still are small,  therefore she wants to consolidate her business and in that way to be able to dedicate more time and offer them a good education.  Along with her husband she divides the daily activities.  She takes care of their sown fields of potatoes and corn, where every morning he plows the pastures and fertilizes them so that they give good fruit.  In spite of the hours of cold and hunger that she passes, she does not feel dismayed, because she knows that every effort always has a reward.  It is so in each crop when they see their effort summarized in the sale of the food to the city.  But some months ago they began the business of buying and selling animals, especially bulls and cows, where they are obtaining a good income.  Along with her husband, they now want to have a full farm and to be able to sell purebreed animals.

She is a hard-working woman who is dedicated and has a great desire to get ahead. She is married to Eliasar, who is currently unemployed. She has one daughter, who in turn is the mother of a son. Together they live in their own home. Rosaura's business is selling food, such as juanes [chicken and rice wrapped in bijao leaves], tamales and fried chicken. She operates this business in the evenings, setting up a table in front of her house, where she serves all of her customers, who are mainly her neighbors, in a very friendly manner. She has run this business for 3 years, and she has her daughter's help with the work of preparing and selling the food. \r\n\r\nShe likes her business, since thanks to it she has been able to escape from many economic hardships. In addition, she can stay in the comfort of her home without paying a lot of expenses. On the other side, she is unhappy when it rains a lot, because sales become very difficult since her stand is on the sidewalk.

They have one daughter, and live in their own home which they recently managed to buy. \r\n\r\nSandy is hardworking, and has been selling ice cream for over 15 years in the town of Palmapampa. To start this business he had to work for an ice cream parlor, but with his savings he now has his own ice cream store where he has many customers. This generated jealousy from the ice cream shop where he used to work, but with a lot of perseverance he did not let it affect him. Thanks to the good service and kindness he offered, he has won the confidence and esteem of his customers. However, he has difficulty in wet weather because it generates little profit. \r\n\r\nWhat Sandy wants most is to expand his business and turn it into a company that can create jobs for people who need it, as Sandy once did. This will be Sandy's 6th loan with MFP, and he is committed to continue to fulfill his payment schedule. He also has a good relationship with his community group, and is grateful for the unconditional support they provide. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, he will pay the household costs and purchase food supplies for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":998840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase food supplies for his family","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-08T04:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-09T04:20:07Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":537.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052480}],"funded_date":"2012-02-11T14:33:37Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Fiona Craig","image":null}},{"id":389573,"name":"Husein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Husein is a 31-year-old married man, father of four children.\r\nHe has been working in car body repair for 16 years, a long enough experience to attract loyal customers & to expand his business.\r\nHusein is applying for a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua in order to buy tools necessary for his business.

Now she has a business where she does a few things related to accounting and administration. She started a small store where she sells groceries, beer, sodas and propane tanks. She knows that this job requires a lot of discipline and that's why she works from 7am to 10pm, during which she attends around 25 people.

After trying several businesses without success, he started selling various products (cooking oil, salt, spaghetti, soaps, etc.).\r\n\r\nHe has a spot at the new market, and his clientele is mainly made up of housekeepers. He is very much in demand from customers, thanks to the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago, he decided to join Kiva's partner, the MFI Soro Yiriwaso, in order to meet an ever-increasing customer demand. He's seeking his fourth personal loan.

Married and the mother of two children, she lives with her two children at her father's house in Sikasso (the third largest administrative region of the republic of Mali). For approximately the last ten years, Mariam has bought and sold 'pagnes' (traditional printed cloths), bedsheets, shoes, embroidered materials, brooms, etc. She conducts this trade from home and on a mobile basis in the town of Sikasso, where she is much sought after by her customers for the quality of her products. To meet the needs of her ever growing customer base, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. Following several group loans with an association of women from her area, she is now taking her third personal loan, with which she plans to purchase 10 traditional outfits, 20 pairs of shoes of various quality, 5 embroidered full length outfits and some brooms.\r\nShe buys her goods locally, and also in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso). Accepting cash or credit, she then sells them retail, by going door-to-door, to a customer base composed essentially of women. \r\n\r\nAll her previous loans have been fully repaid. With this loan she anticipates a monthly profit of 185,000 CFA which will be used essentially to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1001578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural

He lives with his wife and 4-year-old son in their own house which they have built through hard work.  He learned his trade from an uncle who used to take him to work with him when he was a little boy.  He began working as an assistant, then decided to become independent and bought an overlock sewing machine to start his business.  He has a display point in the center of town where his wife has rented a space to offer telephone, photocopying and cell phone recharge services.  The shoe workshop is set up in his home.  Also, on weekends they sell fast food.  His wife covers a large part of the household expenses and takes care of her obligations.  With her sales, she covers operating costs and family expenses, and the additional income is for any extra payments or to make purchases.  William handles a significant stock of products and raw materials for casual shoes.  His accounts receivable have a short turnaround time and his profit margin is adequate for this type of business.  Currently he is requesting a Credikiva loan, his first through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, in an aim to buy raw materials to make school shoes and women's shoes for the upcoming school season.  William wants to produce new school designs and increase his sales volume this season but he did not have the working capital to meet his goals and therefore requested the loan.  He is confident his plans will be successful because experience shows that in the first months of the year there is an increase in school shoes

Her business is selling soft drinks and merchandise from her own home which is located in a neighborhood in the south of the city.  In her business, she sells cold drinks and small electrical appliances which people order from her.  She buys for cash and sells on credit in accordance with her customers' orders.  Right now, her growing customer base is making orders and she must first recover her portfolio (money which is in the hands of customers who pay for their merchandise through monthly or fortnightly payments) so that she is able to respond to them in a timely manner.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan (the first loan she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).\r\n\r\nDiana will use her loan to buy soft drinks in larger quantities, making the most of the fact that Carnival season is approaching and this is a time when her sales increase.  She will also buy merchandise which her customers have ordered in order to enjoy Carnival such as ladies' accessories, footwear, etc.  Diana's goal for the future is to turn her business into a soft drinks store where she can also sell a variety of merchandise, in a very commercial area which is separate from her home.  While she works towards this, she maintains a return on sales (operating margin) of no less than 23% and an accounts receivable turnover of eight days.  These are the financial indicators from which we project her growth."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":997411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks, ladies' accessories, footwear, etc. in large quantities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-08T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-09T11:50:01Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":69284},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":74789},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76534},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78320},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80148},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82018},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83932},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85890},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87894},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89945},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92044},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":99202}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.01},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.03},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.84,"local_amount":69284,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":72266.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039228},{"amount":43,"local_amount":74789,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78008.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651356},{"amount":44.01,"local_amount":76534,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":79828.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140966},{"amount":45.03,"local_amount":78320,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":81691.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100859},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":80148,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":83598.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338482},{"amount":357.03,"local_amount":620925,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":647655.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395049}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T17:46:19Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":388319,"name":"Norma Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Norma continua comercializando ropa, cosmetico, logrando apoyar a su esposo con los gastos, sus dos hijos estudian y su esposo sigue trabajando como conductor.\nHoy en dia do\u00f1a Norma esta contenta por que tiene su propio terreno, ya que todos estos a\u00f1os ha vivido junto a su mama, en cuarto aparte, pero ahora esta comenzando con su nueva casa, construida de laminas de zinc y que espera ir construyendo poco  a poco.\nCon este nuevo prestamo sera para comprar ropa escolar a mas cantidad en camisa, falda, calcetas, zapatos escolares, a si como cosmeticos el cual los vende por encargos.

near mountains, as can be seen in his photo. Since his youth, he's been fattening and selling cattle, which he buys at the Chairukh animal market.
