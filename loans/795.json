She has a food business where she prepares and sells 'chicha' (a traditional corn-based drink), soda, juice, potatoes stuffed with meat and cheese, cheese fingers, and snacks in general.  She started her business when she realized that her mother earned good money in the same business. At first she started out selling soup and pies but gradually her work ethic and her desire to do well gave her new ideas.  Now she not only sells meals in small quantities but she also has a sales location with heated display cases and a chiller cabinet where she offers nice cold drinks. She has a lot of sales owing to the permanent warm climate of the Colombian Carribean coast.  Erica is currently applying for her first Kiva loan, which will also be her first loan from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.

She lives with 35-year-old Miguel, with whom she has a three-year-old son. They live together in a house she owns. She devotes herself full-time to working and to raising her son. Crhis sells soft drinks and beer to people of legal drinking age. She also sells food. She displays her merchandise in her refrigerator daily. On weekends, she sells typical food from that region and from other areas, since she has a lot of experience in the kitchen.

At first he started working with people around the neighborhood by sowing part-time, but for the past six years he has worked by himself. He sells his produce in the local market of the town of Esteli. His brother helps him work; together they harvest and sell the crop. When they're not sowing, they sell milk and livestock. He requested the loan in order to purchase supplies to sow 870 acres of tomatoes. He hopes to get a crop of good quality and very good profits. This will allow him to keep expanding his sowing areas and to improve the quality of the livestock he raises."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":998955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies to sow 870 acres of tomatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2012-02-09T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-10T00:50:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":976.52,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":976.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":976.52,"processed_date":"2012-10-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308449092}],"funded_date":"2012-02-11T01:31:53Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":388394,"name":"Janet Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Janet es socia del Banco Comunal Los Tunales, tiene 33 a\u00f1os, es socia de FINCA Per\u00fa desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, es madre de 1 hija menor de edad, es conviviente, se dedica a la compra\/venta de repuestos y lubricantes para veh\u00edculos, es socia por medio de su mam\u00e1, le gusta las capacitaciones porque le ayudan a mejorar en su negocio y su familia, gracias a FINCA su negocio ha mejorado, antes solo ten\u00eda poca mercader\u00eda, ahora esta llenando su tienda con mas lubricantes, en las capacitaciones tambi\u00e9n le ense\u00f1a a ahorrar, el pr\u00e9stamo que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en  aumentar mas mercader\u00eda en lo que es repuestos comprando muelles para carros.","en":"Janet is a member of Los Tunales Communal Bank and has been a member of FINCA Per\u00fa for 2 years.

Day after day he goes to his farm, which is located a few meters from his home, where he begins his daily labor. He owns 18 hectares (almost 44.5 acres) divided into three different types of cultivation: corn, rice and cacao. He has a good market for each product and is one of the farmers whose crops are most anticipated.  He has learned a great deal in his 30 years dedicated to this work and he continues to learn more every day, knowledge that  he is now trying to teach his children.\r\n\r\nEulogio enjoys his work because he can dedicate time to his family as well as being able to share with them what he has learned. He still remembers when he was very young, only 13, and began to help his parents in this work. Consequently he knows that being a farmer is very complex and he now wants to be able to improve his income and provide his children with a good education.

Elizabeth wants to provide her children with a better quality of life and a good education. She makes a living buying, selling and raising livestock. She has 10 heads of cattle, including bulls, cows and calves. She also goes out every day in search of cows and bigger bulls to buy and then take to the slaughterhouse to get a share of the profits. Once she's done with this work she goes to her farm to feed her animals, which she has been raising for two years. It has been going very well and she has made good income to support the family finances. This will be her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP. She always has been a very good member of her community bank, where she is loved for being very responsible and supportive.

They have 2 children together.  They own their home which is located in the Llochegua district.  When you are doing something that satisfies you and that you like, it is good to pursue it as a career, and that is what Freddy is doing.  He tells us that he used to be a driver out of economic necessity.  However, he didn't feel very satisfied, so he left that job to cultivate cacao and coffee.  He has been doing this work for 7 years and earns good money thanks to his tireless efforts and continuous dedication.  He usually works with the support of his dear wife, but during the harvest and maintenance periods he needs laborers who help speed up the work.  Freddy is happy with this job as it has allowed him to buy a home.  This is his second loan with MFP.  He promises to make his payments on time.

She is 56 and a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. She is a widow with two children. \r\n\r\nShe, together with her children, manages her own household, while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJamelie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. \r\n\r\nShe earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJamelie hopes her business will grow more in the coming year and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1002024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He's single with no children, and he lives alone in his own house. He is responsible for looking after his parents, so he works very hard every day to make sure they are comfortable in their own age. When someone in Guillermo's neighbourhood needs to move from one place to another, he is always there ready to help his passengers, who in the majority of cases are acquaintances of his.

He hopes in the future to be able to buy another mototaxi and to earn an additional income by hiring it out. This will be his third loan with MFP, with which he hopes to continue working towards his goals.

Regarding her life circumstances she is a single mother and has to raise her youngest daughter Tracy who is six all by her herself. Nevertheless, as her character is that of an exuberant and strong woman, she is not daunted by anything and is willing to move forward along with her daughter, who is her driving force and reason for overcoming. Every day Lia goes out very early in search of products from the wholesale merchants of secondhand clothing. From there she heads to her post on a downtown street surrounded by many people who are doing their shopping. There she takes the opportunity to display her products for sale. Additionally, when she isn't making many sales at her stand she heads for the nearby hamlets or pueblos in order to sell her products or exchange them for poultry. She has been doing this work for four years and enjoys it a lot since she is in charge of her own schedule and occasionally may travel. It's going very well for her since she sells a lot, and more when she sells in other places. She hopes to keep working and making progress little by little, and thus in the future to set up a clothing shop. \r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with MFP. She is very happy that they would offer her financial support so she can increase her working capital. She knows she will have to be very responsible and above all highly punctual. With the requested amount of 2,000 Peruvian soles she will purchase more items of apparel since she wishes to pass through the hamlets and pueblos which is where she sells more, and so makes better earnings. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":999380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more clothing.

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, she was widowed some time ago, but this did not prevent her from giving an education and good habits to her daughter Sindy, 21, whom she is raising as a single mother.  Together they live in her own home where, in addition to her daughter at her side, she also has her mother, whom she wants to give a better quality of life for her old age.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Juliana saw that work was the way to stand out in this competitive world.  She did all types of jobs until one day, thanks to a friend who invited her to a fish sale in a market in the city, she discovered that she could do this job and that she liked how it worked.  Also, it would allow her to have time to be with her daughter and, even better, have an income for her finances.\r\n\r\nShe has been doing her job for ten years, and she learned a lot from all the experiences she had.  In her job she is very well loved by her fellow workers because she always has a smile and an encouraging word for her friends.  She has lots of plans in mind but for the moment what she most wants is to be able to continue working, and later be able to set up a grocery store in her house.\r\n\r\nThis will be her eighteenth loan with MFP.

She has been running an Internet Caf\u00e9 for 4 years.\nShe says she has decided to start this activity because she was looking for a way to support her family, to improve her standard of living and to count on a good economic solvency to thus keep on paying for her children\u2019s education. The loan she has requested will be invested in the purchase of 2 computers, USB cables, papers and so on.\nLuisa\u2019s biggest dream is to invest much more in her activity to make it grow more quickly, as she wants to enlarge and improve her working space a little bit, because in this way she will increase her earnings, thus granting a professional education to her children.\nShe says she is deeply grateful to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad\u2019s lenders for the big support and deep trust she has been granted.\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":997593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy 2 computers, USB cables and papers.

He plants cacao, banana plants, and maize, which he grows on 60 hectares of land on his farm.  During his 20 years of working he learned to be very organized in order to get things done.  He also gets help from his partner, though at times when there is more work he has to hire laborers to help him harvest and bring the heavy bags to the place where he sells his produce.  Neiro really likes his work, since it generates income and allows him to stay close to his family.  He remembers that when he started out he struggled hard to get results, but over time he developed skills and is now a good farmer who produces some of the best crops in his community.  He hopes to keep growing and to begin planting other types of crops, which would allow him and his family to gradually get ahead.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Neiro\u2019s fifth loan with MFP.

He will also use the money to set up a mechanized irrigation system on his farm, since that will save him time and money. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":999527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice seeds and improve his irrigation system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-10T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-11T00:00:03Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neiro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401061}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T20:21:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":388755,"name":"Adela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adela vive con su esposo y sus dos  hijos, es agricultora, siembra granos b\u00e1sicos junto a la familia, el negocio lo inicio por iniciativa propia y con la ayuda de su familia, trabaja todos los d\u00edas a tiempo completo, no tiene horario fijo para atender a sus clientes.\nElla esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de insumos agr\u00edcolas, como semilla, abono, herbicidas, esta compra le ayudara a mejorar sus cosechas y sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos.\nSu mayor sue\u00f1o es obtener buenas cosechas para mejorar su ingresos y vivir feliz con su familia.\n\n","en":"Adela lives with her husband and two children.

Also, a small part of the credit will be used for repairing the minibus which is now broken. When cows are fed well, their milking capacity increases.

Ana Luisa says that a little less than a year ago she opened a small convenience store in her home with the support of her husband in order to earn extra income and help him with household expenses and their children's education. She works every day out of her home, opening her store at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m., and she enjoys having a well-stocked store so her customers can always find what they're looking for. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of beans, rice, oil, cookies, candy, soup, drinks, cheese, cream, milk, salt, sugar, ham and canned goods to restock her business. She hopes that with this investment her business will attract more customers and she can continue growing her store.

The climate is hot and there are many rubber trees scattered on the outskirts of town. Mrs. Guadalupe, or Lupe as her friends call her, is 43 years old and only completed primary school. She is married to Delfino who works in the bakery. They have seven children, of which 5 are already married. Of the youngest daughters, one is a single mother and the youngest is in high school. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that more than 22 years ago, she and her husband started to work making and selling bread. When they started, they had an oven to make \"pan de piedra\" (rock-shaped bread). The oven uses wood, but a couple of years ago, they received some monetary support and were able to buy a gas oven, a big mixer and a tray to grow and improve her business. They have always worked selling bread and they get up very early to start making the bread to sell it to the women who take their children to school very early.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also operates a small barber shop for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMarilou hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her child a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is separated and has three children. One is 27 years old and is independent, the second, Darcery, is 5 years old and Richard is 1 year old. They live together in their own house where Rosario works hard daily to be able to offer a better quality of life. Rosario is a woman who does not say no to big challenges. When she saw the need for money every month she decided to venture into another job without disturbing her current one, which is as a cleaner in the area. So she decided to sell 'delivery breakfasts'. She built up her customer list amongst her flatmates and work colleagues. She started this activity four years ago and she carries it out with the contracted help of another woman.\r\n\r\nThis activity is going very well as she has good orders. She feels calm as at the end of the month she sees her income which is destined to her home. She hopes to continue doing well and she believes she will as her orders are increasing daily. She hopes to extend her business. This will be her 4th loan with MFP. She is very happy knowing she will have financial support and this gives her the tranquillity to continue with her work. With the loan of 2,000 PEN she will buy ingredients and supplies to continue with her work, as well as a blender and a professional juice extractor."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":998170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies and ingredients, as well as a blender and a juicer extractor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-10T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-11T11:30:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":297.85},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":319.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":318.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":343.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":355.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":364.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.47},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":111.69,"local_amount":297.85,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":300.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386440},{"amount":170.04,"local_amount":453.43,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":457.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099537},{"amount":69.36,"local_amount":184.97,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":186.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713680},{"amount":128.86,"local_amount":343.61,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":346.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202570},{"amount":133.29,"local_amount":355.46,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:13Z","rounded_local_amount":358.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098254},{"amount":136.76,"local_amount":364.68,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":367.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401040}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T05:26:37Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":390262,"name":"Adelie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelie works hard to support her family.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan.

Unfortunately she looked after her twin daughters alone, since they were three years old, as her husband passed away. After going through this sad situation she spent her time caring for her young children alone. A lot of time has passed since then; her children are now grown up and with a lot of hard work she has been able to give them the education that they needed. She devoted herself to trading and to providing education in the afternoons to other children with the aim of generating income.\r\n\r\nMaria is a woman who likes to prepare sweets and she makes a living in this activity in her free time. Like a good Peruvian she is a fan of all spicy dishes and she enjoys them a lot. She currently lives in the city of Mala, located to the south of the capital of Peru, Lima. Mala is characterised by its lovely and generous inhabitants of this beautiful little town.\r\n\r\nIn order to generate income Maria decided to set up a bookshop - a bazaar. This shop has been open for approximately 5 years, long enough to have taught her a lot about her business. She tends the shop from 6:30 in the morning until 8:30 in the evening. During this time she serves an average of 18 customers. Her customers always come back and she is sure that it is because of her friendliness and the variety of products she offers. As another activity she sells \"Colado\", made from sweetened beans, which she sells weekly to her customers who live near her house.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Kiva's loans, Maria will be able to buy school supplies and uniforms, and gifts to stock her bazaar. She will also buy some supplies to prepare the colado that she sells. She hopes to be able to increase her sales thanks to the festivities that are celebrated until the month of May. All this effort and business vision will lead her to increase the quantity of her products and so also increase her income as well as being able to save in order to later extend her business, to buy display cabinets, scaffolding and other items. Her dream is to be able to see her business grow and to see her twin daughters married and completely happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":998173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMyrna hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
