","en":"Kulmira is 52 years old, married and has three children.  In search of an additional source of income for her family, she started her own business of reselling agricultural crops in 2002.  Kulmira used an initial sum of 5,000 som (KGS) for the first purchase of potatoes for resale and was able to develop her business to have a working capital of 30,000 som (KGS).  The earnings from the business allowed her to purchase a UAZ car to transport potatoes.  In order to further grow her business, Kulmira requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to increase goods turnover.  In the near future, she also plans to use the profits from the loan to make repairs to her home and continue to expand her

People use meat in everyday national dishes such as pilau and dolma and often use yogurt as a sauce. Milk products are considered very healthy to eat; they are present in everyday life.\r\n<p>\r\nRovshan\u2019s cattle business brings in 200 AZN a month, the family\u2019s only income. It is not enough to cover the basic needs of his beloved children. He has applied for a 1300 AZN loan with ACU (his second loan with them) to purchase two cattle, one milker and fodder for them. Rovshan has a good client history.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":1002746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

Her 20 years of experience in this field make her a very skilled farmer. Raising crops takes a lot of strength and working in the open air, for which Yegana requires a lot of help from her son. \r\n\r\nYegana usually sells her crop in the central bazaar. Locally, people eat fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy. In fact, many national dishes are made of vegetables, like pilau and dolma.

Some say that it comes from something an Englishman once said: \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca is a bit like London), owing to the fog which frequently covers the city during the Winter, just like it does in the UK capital."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":992989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove, crockery and merchandise for preparing her food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2012-02-10T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-11T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":528586,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":40279},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":40327},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":41097},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41881},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":42680},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":43495},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":44325},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45171},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":45775},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47103},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":47806},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":48647}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.73},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":259.02,"local_amount":121703,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:12Z","rounded_local_amount":123735.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315308},{"amount":179.98,"local_amount":84561,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":85973.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031494},{"amount":186.9,"local_amount":87820,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":89286.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643671},{"amount":193.57,"local_amount":90946,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":92464.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283324254},{"amount":201.99,"local_amount":94909,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:57:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96493.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287430111},{"amount":103.54,"local_amount":48647,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":49459.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294332901}],"funded_date":"2012-02-13T23:08:14Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:29:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":390405,"name":"Olivian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olivian is married with three children all of whom are under fifteen.

They live in a four-bedroom house with one person per room at Mbomasa, a quarter in Bamenda Mezam Division of the North West Region of Cameroon. He has faced challenges in life such as deaths, sickness and accidents of family members.\r\n\r\nHe joined GHAPE in 2005 and has taken and successfully managed and repaid his loans four times with no major difficulties .He has been investing  his loan in a corn mill, grazing of animals and farming of crops. Given a new loan, he will expand his activities. He will buy more cattle, hire a herder who will take care of the cattle and buy seedlings for his farm. He strongly believes his business will succeed because he has a large piece of land where his animals can graze, the dropping will be used as manure for the farm products and he will buy a good breed of cattle. From this activity, the community will benefit from the droppings and from the sale of food crops like cassava, corn and beans, which he will harvest from the farm and sell to them at moderate prices. He will make sure the crops are available at all times.\r\n\r\nThe profit from the loan will be used for employment of more workers to work on the farm, for the education of his children, and for the addition of rooms to his house. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the low interest rate, the education they provide on loan management and marketing techniques given to him by GHAPE.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":1002776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is 52 years old and lives in her own home together with her husband, 54-year-old Bonifacio, and their five adult children.  Daria has been planting and harvesting her whole life.  Thanks to this work, she has managed to obtain her own plot of farmland where she sows cacao and coffee plants.  When she harvests her crops, she takes them to the warehouses in her town and sells them.  At first, Daria worked alone but, since she started her family, she has received the help of her husband and children who support her during difficult times.  During periods of the year when rain is a permanent feature, pests eventually appear and they manage to destroy her plantations.  However, Daria takes a lot of care to keep them fertile as they are her household's means of support.  Over time, Daria plans to increase her number of plants as this is the work that she most enjoys, even though she has to face many difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis will be Daria's sixth loan from MFP.  She pledges to continue working responsibly as this loan is very helpful to the running and growth of her farm.

At harvest time, they have the support of their fellow farmers and neighbors as they work in a reciprocal manner.  They gather in the fruit quickly because they have a lot of experience.  After the harvest, they take their crops to the warehouses in their town where they receive a good price per kilogram.  In the future, Gloria is planning to grow more plants as they are profitable.\r\n\r\nThis will be Gloria's eighth loan from MFP.

She lives in her own home together with her husband, 39-year-old R\u00f3mulo, and their seven beloved children who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.  Beatriz is a compassionate woman who is committed to her work in the fields where she provides a lot of care for her coffee crops because her family depend on her crop production.  What she most enjoys about her work is being able to work together with her husband and children who encourage her to make progress with her coffee plants.  However, she finds it difficult to get rid of the weeds that grow between her plants.  Up to now, she has had the support of MFP who support the way in which she works on her land.\r\n\r\nThis will be Maribel's fourteenth loan from MFP.  She feels proud to know that she will receive your support once again.  Maribel is a responsible member of her community bank.

Cirila is from a town where everyone earns their living from farming and she started working in the green fields there when she was just a girl.  She has had her own farm, growing coffee, for 17 years now.  She operates the farm with help from her partner, Felimon, and a few neighbors.  What she most likes about the business is harversting her crop, reaping the benefits of the very hard work before.  She tells us that she'll never stop growing coffee, despite the effort to care for coffee plants, because she can make more money from it to support her family than she can from any other crop.  This will be Cirila's fourth MFP loan and she says she is happy with the support she's received from her community bank.  The other members of the community bank consider her to be a supportive and responsible member of the bank.\r\nCirilia will use this 2,000 new soles loan to hire day laborers to help her harvest her coffee crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1000816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers for her farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-11T14:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-12T14:10:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":166.24},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":181.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":181.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":189.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":194.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":203.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":208.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":217.8},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":225.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":231.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.97},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.07},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.22},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.34,"local_amount":166.24,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386462},{"amount":67.97,"local_amount":181.26,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099564},{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":182.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713706},{"amount":71.14,"local_amount":189.69,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":191.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202597},{"amount":73.07,"local_amount":194.86,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":196.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098281},{"amount":76.22,"local_amount":203.26,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:11Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401068},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":208.32,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":209.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455538},{"amount":81.68,"local_amount":217.8,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":219.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451310},{"amount":84.55,"local_amount":225.48,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":227.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446492},{"amount":86.92,"local_amount":231.78,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":233.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052496}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T08:55:09Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":389263,"name":"Belquiz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Belquiz se provision\u00f3 bien de c\u00e1rnicos y compr\u00f3 implementos de trabajo con su credikiva.

She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 25,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngela dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Aside from this business, she also prepares and sells cooked viands for additional income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 800 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 40,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.

","en":"28-year-old Silvana is single and has a four-year-old daughter.  Every day she makes income from her recycling business which she set up in 2011.  As an industrial engineer, she used to work for a recycling company but she became sick.  She had to take sick leave and then leave her job.  As she had studied recycling during her time at University, and her dissertation was on this topic, when she became unemployed she decided to start buying recyclable material from big industries which she then sold on to recycling companies and companies that recycle cardboard, PVC, paper, plastics, etc.  Her current dream is to further grow her business and to build her mother a beautiful house.  She also dreams of giving her daughter the opportunity to enjoy a successful future.  Her medium-term goal is to buy machines so that she can process the material herself because her biggest challenge is the competition which creates a lot of pressure in the market in which she works.  While she works towards achieving this goal, Silvana's accounts receivable turnover period is one day and her stock turnover period is three days.

It's not easy to find larger sizes locally, so she specially purchases clothing for people who need these sizes and brings the goods back to her town to sell. Mariya does not have competition in her market. There is a demand and clientele for the goods she sells. Mariya's shop is in a good location and she has been in business for five years. Currently, Mariya has 35,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in inventory. Her profit is 6,2000 hryvnias. Mariya needs a loan of 12,000 hryvnias to purchase quality goods in Chernovtsi and increase her working assets.

He has a construction business repairing and renovating homes, apartments, offices and other places. Roman started his business five years ago. Prior to this he worked as a security guard and then as a manager before deciding that he needed to go into business for himself. He acquired the minimum equipment needed and began working alone, then recruited 2-3 others to work with him. Currently he manages a team of workers who complete jobs under his direction. Roman requests a loan of 20,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) to purchase construction equipment, specifically two cement mixers. This equipment will help him complete jobs more quickly, increasing the income of his business. Roman is a caring family man, a good friend and a trusted partner to his clients. In people he values qualities such as honesty, initiative, and loyalty. Roman also cares for his mother's elderly sister, who is alone and needs help.

The group has six members and is run by a board of directors which is headed by Vicenta.  The businesses that the members of the bank are engaged in are varied and include: making traditional 'cholita' shoes, selling sports shoes, selling fruit, selling food, making 'polleras' (traditional skirts) and distributing cereals.\r\n\r\nVicenta says that she has been working with Pro Mujer for two loan cycles.  She joined the institution through an invitation from her friends and neighbors.  She currently has a business making and selling traditional 'cholita' shoes which she has been working in for some time.\r\n\r\nVicenta will use her loan to increase her capital.  She will buy leather wholesale in La Ceja and then, after she has made her products, she will sell them to order.  This work allows her to make income with which to support her family.  She is single and has six children.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked her what she likes about Pro Mujer, Vicenta replied that she likes the health services."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":1000888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-02-11T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-12T17:40:04Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salome","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10606.05,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1767.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.34},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":1767.71,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418182},{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":1767.71,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133067},{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":1767.71,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749879},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":1767.71,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243363},{"amount":258.34,"local_amount":1767.71,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516232},{"amount":258.31,"local_amount":1767.5,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1771.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441168}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T23:15:37Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":390770,"name":"Maribeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This time Maribeth is borrowing PHP 25,000 to fund her general store.

She buys bedsheets, curtains and clothes from a wholesaler and sells them in a local market in Brazzaville.\r\n\r\nShe has had this business for the past five years. She uses the loans to buy many different varieties of cloth in bulk. Sometimes she sells what she finds in the market. Now she has found only the bedsheets and curtains to sell.\r\n\r\nNancy has found that good customer service and an attractive display of cloth is important for the success of her business.

He lives in Ica, Per\u00fa which is located in the Sechura desert, about four hours south of Lima, the capital of the country. Ica is known by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" (the land of sun). It is known in Peru for having earthquakes often (one 8.0 in 2007 and one 6.9 in 2011), it's production of grapes, asparagus and olives, and perhaps above all, for being the source of the traditional national drink of Peru, Pisco.\r\n\r\nIt is in this dry and hot climate that the house and business of the client is located. In his free time he enjoys listening to music. As Peru is known for having some of the most delicious food in the world, one of Miguel's favorite dishes is ceviche.

She lives with Jorge, with whom she had five children, of whom only one lives with them: Miguel, who takes care of them in their own house, located in the district of Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez. Her main activity during the week is the purchase and sale of sheep. Her business consists of collecting sheep from the stock farmers, and later she sells them for a higher price at the livestock markets which exist in different locations in her city. She travels a lot, and so she is very well known in her area. On weekends, she and her husband sell firewood. They buy trees and they themselves cut the firewood to market it in the city of Huancayo, where they have regular customers. She tells us that she does not have a secure income, since her capital varies according to the size of the trees; her results depend on this. Alongside this work, her husband works as a mason, repairing various houses and building others. Everything depends on the contracts he makes. Now she wants to increase her working capital to continue producing more. This is her seventh loan with MFP, where she hopes for a small loan so that she can complete her objectives. On the other hand, she promises once more to make her payments. In addition, she is thankful to be part of her association (communal bank) because all its members are responsible and united.\r\n\r\nRaquilda, on receiving her loan, will invest the money she has requested in the purchase of more trees to produce more firewood.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1000941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives with her husband, Carlos. They are recently married and have a 10-year-old son together, Kener, who they look after in their own house in the area of Pampa Blanca. Yessica describes herself as an individual and works in private transport, driving an auto-rickshaw from her neighbourhood to the city of Pampas, where she gives lifts to the people that live there. She says that she is very admired because she's one of the few women who do this work. She also spends her time carrying out various jobs for the local government, like cleaning up the gardens and pavements. She likes to keep busy, so she always helps her sister-in-law in looking after her cows, which means she can get a little bit of fresh milk for her son, which he loves.\r\n\r\nFor his part, her husband works as a bricklayer for a housebuilding company, which gives him a monthly wage. Now their biggest dream is to live in Huancayo, one of the largest cities in the country. They are already taking the first step to achieve this dream. This is Yessica's second credit with MFP; she is hoping for a small loan to help them achieve their goals, and she promises once again to keep up with her repayments.
