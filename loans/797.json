Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours south of Lima, the capital, and is described by Peruvians as the Land of Sun. It is known for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus and olives and, perhaps above all, for being the origin of the traditional Peruvian national drink, pisco. In this hot, arid climate lives Rafael and his customers. In his free time he likes to go out driving with his son to distract himself from his problems. It is well known that Peru is famous for having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Rafael loves is 'aji de gallina' (chilli chicken).\r\n\r\nRafael is a taxi driver and works 15 hours a day providing transport for around 70 customers. He thinks that he does well in his job because he offers a good service and because he respects his customers. He is grateful to Kiva's lenders because, with the help offered, he will be able to carry out maintenance on his vehicle to keep it in a good state, which will mean he can provide a safe service as well as earning a greater income and progress in his biggest dream of owning a fleet of cars and starting a taxi

At home in Huari, her mother has cows and sheep and grows potatoes. She pens the sheep that she buys from the shepherds there, feeds them and fattens them up to sell them later on for a better price at the different markets that are held each week in Huancayo. Now she wants to save some money and open a restaurant where she lives as there aren't any at the moment. She belongs to the loan group \"Santa Teresa\" and this is her first loan from MFP, and she is waiting for a small loan so that she can meet her goals. She also promises to make her repayments.

Together they have 3 small children who they care for in a rented house in the Acraquia area. She feels very happy as she is on the point of owning her own house to live in. She makes a living in multiple ways. During the mornings, she works in a house where she cooks and cleans, and, in the afternoons, she works at a new university that is being built. The state pays her a monthly wage for cleaning services here. But the activity that she never fails to develop is farming. She grows corn, barley, and potatoes on her own land. At each harvest, and after much care, she sells her crops at the main market and also takes advantage of the opportunity to sell the animals that she raises, which include cows, sheep, and chickens. She would like to spend all her time farming but, as she says, \"this is a long-term investment.\"  So, she has to generate income to cover the costs of feeding and educating her children. This is her second loan from MFP, and she is waiting for a small loan so she can meet her goals. She promises to make her repayments. She is grateful to be part of the community bank because all the members are responsible and united people. On receiving her loan, Irma will use it for building her new house, which she will own. She will buy windows, doors, and other items. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1000963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy windows and doors.

Es conocida en el Per\u00fa por sus frecuentes terremotos (un 8,0 en 2007 y 6.9 en 2011), su producci\u00f3n de uvas, esp\u00e1rragos y aceitunas, y tal vez sobre todo, como la fuente de la bebida tradicional del Per\u00fa nacional, el Pisco.

En su tiempo libre disfruta escuchar m\u00fasica;  como bien se sabe el Per\u00fa se caracteriza por tener las comidas m\u00e1s deliciosas del mundo y uno de los platos que a Armando le gusta mucho es lomo Saltado. Armando estudi\u00f3 hasta quinto a\u00f1o de secundaria pero le hubiera gustado mucho estudiar Derecho. Armando es padre soltero y tiene 2  hijos a los cuales ama mucho y estudian educaci\u00f3n primaria.\n\t\nArmando trabaja como Chofer de taxi, labora alrededor de 15 horas diarias.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is celebrated by Peruvians as the \"Land of the Sun.\"  In Peru, it is known for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007, and 6.9 in 2011); its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives; and perhaps especially, as the source of the traditional national drink of Peru, pisco.\r\n\r\nThe home and business of the client is located in this warm and dry climate. In his free time, he likes to listen to music. As is well known, Peru is noted for having some of the most delicious foods in the world, and one of the dishes that Armando really likes is lomo saltado (beef saut\u00e9ed with onions and potatoes).  \r\n\r\nArmando studied as far as fifth year of secondary school, but he really would have liked to study law. Armando is a single father, and has two children whom he loves very much, and who go to primary school. \r\n\r\nArmando works as a taxi driver, around 15 hours a day. In one day, Armando can serve up to 60 customers. He believes that his business is going well because he serves his customers in a friendly way, and is responsible and honest.\r\n\r\nNow, he is very thankful to the Kiva lenders, because with their help, he will be able to have the paperwork processed to renew his driver's licence, as this is very costly, and to carry out maintenance work on his vehicle. By doing this, he will be able to avoid getting fines, and will have a vehicle in good condition for offering a safe service. \r\n\r\nThis will enable him, in a few months, to fulfill his great dream, \"To provide an occupation to his children, and have a new car.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1000964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To process the renewal of his driver's licence, and pay for the maintenance of his vehicle.

He lives in Ica, Peru. \r\n\r\nIca is located in the the Sechura Desert about four hours south of Lima, the country's capital. It is known to Peruvians as \"The Land of Sun\". It is also known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (one at 8.0 in 2007 and another at 6.9 in 2011), its grape, asparagus, and olive production, and perhaps more than anything as the birthplace of Pisco, the traditional national drink of Peru. In this hot and arid climate one can find Ruly's home and business. In his free time he like to play soccer. As is well known, Peru is characterized around the world by its delicious food and one of its most well known dishes is the delicious \"Caldo de Gallina\". Ruly studied up to the fifth year of secondary school but he would have liked to have studied to be a teacher. \r\n\r\nRuly makes a living selling bread from a cart that he has.

In addition, he raises sheep, goats and poultry at the rear of the house, where he has set up strategic areas to maintain his animals. His father, who is participating in this loan by affixing his signature as co-signer, supports Jean Carlos in all his daily activities associated with his businesses. \r\n\r\nJean Carlos wants to expand his business by buying more staple products because he feels that his customer base is growing.

She is single and has 4 children who are all currently in school.

Gradually she began to sell ice cream and sweets and to offer cell phone services to customers, who, in addition to students are today also house wives, teachers and neighbors in the area.\r\n\r\nLastenia\u2019s major challenge is not having sufficient working capital to effectively meet her customers\u2019 demands.

He is completely convinced that he will be a punctual client and, above all, will not disappoint the institution that is allowing him to realize in part his dream.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of 800 PEN he will buy some parts and spare parts to refurbish his vehicle, because they deteriorated with the passing of time and the bad road conditions.

Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nShe is a very good mother and housewife who raises chickens and pigs. She has a small farm business at her house. She buys the chickens and pigs when they are young and then feeds and cares for the chickens two or three months and the pigs a little longer. When they are ready, she sells them to merchants who come to her house and carry them off to different markets in the province. She works every day since it is something she can do without leaving the house. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more chickens and feed for both chickens and pigs.

He is engaged in the greenhouse farming business and has eight large greenhouses.  His farm is big, but everything is always kept in order.  Every year, Alexander plants 12,000 tomato bushes of both high- and low-growing varieties in his greenhouses.  The part of his land on which he grows tomatoes is situated on the shore of a reservoir, which protects the plantings from morning frosts.  Alexander has been farming for 17 years now.  Every year he has expenses of up to 50,000 hriven (UAH) for seed and plastic film for the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nAlexander is planning to invest the 20,000 hriven loan he receives through KIVA in the building of an additional greenhouse on a large piece of land that his family bought last year with the goal of enlarging the farm.  Alexander has future plans to put new greenhouses on the new piece of land, which is 0.87ha in size.  There are also plans to install heating systems in the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nNote: story in

She has a business making crafts and handiwork she makes with her own hands: rag dolls, picture frames and other items for which she employs the use of \"country\" style, a technique she learned from her mother who has a business with these same characteristics. Her goal is to expand the structure of her business, making clothing and becoming a famous designer, but her greatest challenge is the lack of capital for achieving it since, with her growing clientele, money runs short for investing and increasing her earnings. \r\n\r\nThus she turns to her Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with which she will purchase basic materials for her business. She expects the investment will be successful because she will buy in greater quantities and be able to respond to her expanded customer base more promptly. In her business she yields an average profitability of 49.6%, from which she plans her gradual growth in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1001579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic materials in larger quantities, such as cloth, yarn, thread, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72748},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78528},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80361},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82236},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":84155},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86118},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88128},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90184},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92288},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94442},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96645},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104167}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.73},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":72748,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":74202.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039244},{"amount":44.87,"local_amount":78528,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":80098.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651368},{"amount":45.92,"local_amount":80361,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":81968.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140981},{"amount":47,"local_amount":82236,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83880.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100872},{"amount":48.08,"local_amount":84155,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":85838.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338496},{"amount":49.21,"local_amount":86118,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87840.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395060},{"amount":50.36,"local_amount":88128,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":89890.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774879},{"amount":104.27,"local_amount":182472,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":186121.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993745},{"amount":168.72,"local_amount":295254,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:53Z","rounded_local_amount":301159.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381706013}],"funded_date":"2012-02-14T03:41:11Z","paid_date":"2013-07-20T08:44:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":389720,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nelly tiene 40 a\u00f1os, dedicada con mucho amor a su esposo Marcelino de 54 a\u00f1os y sus 06 hijos, viven en su propia casa ubicada en la comunidad de Palmapampa.

Her family lives in the city of Khoost.  Mariya is retired, but she is very active and can't just sit around the house doing nothing.  Because of this, Mariya decided to earn extra money at home by making duvets to order.  Using material brought by her clients, Mariya provides them with high quality, well made duvets.

She lives in San Jacinto, land of vertical weaving, hammocks and other beautiful artisanal crafts made by hand mainly by the women of this region. That is why it isn't unusual that Yarnelis follows this tradition and applies it to her business, with which she generates income for her home. She sells artisanal crafts such as backpacks and hats, among others. She knows that every season, there is a star product, and since carnival is approaching, she is working on the exhibition of the famous San Jacinteros hats. However, her working capital is insufficient for responding to her supply plan. That is the reason that she has turned to a Kiva loan, the eighth loan she has taken out with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy hats, which she will exhibit at her business, and which usually sell at a good price, obtaining good earnings. During the 10 years that she has been benefitting form loans from this organization, she has been able to increase her inventory, improve her locale, etc. Her goal for the future is to put sliding doors in her business to increase security and achieve a more comfortable environment that invites customers in to buy her products.

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  Andrea is a very good client with a good credit history.  She has a business selling clothing and shoes in an itinerant manner.  She does this work along with her beloved husband.  They take their products throughout all of the valley, from their town to as far as Puerto Ene. For them, this work begins on Wednesdays when they go around to many towns, looking for a good quantity of customers in each town to whom they can sell their products.  Also, the people who already know them always buy their garments, because they offer them for sale at an affordable price.  Before doing this kind of work, Andrea used to sell vegetables, which was also profitable, but this business had the disadvantage that the products were very perishable.  This is why she switched to selling clothing.  In the future, she is thinking of renting a sales stall in the same town of Pichari, so that she would not have to travel from one place to another to sell her clothing, because this is very arduous work.  This is the second loan that she has taken with MFP, and so she promises once more to make all of her scheduled payments.  Andrea is happy and content with her communal bank, because everyone in the group is punctual with their payments.  With the 3,000 Peruvian soles she requests, she will buy more garments to sell.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1001624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more garments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T22:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T22:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andrea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3022.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331187679}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T23:40:48Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T14:51:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":389768,"name":"Luz Radiante - Chupaca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"L.

She is 54 years old and married to Bienvinido. She and her husband live with her mother.\r\n\r\nCristina is thankful because even though she only completed elementary school, she is still able to operate her furniture business. She produces chairs, tables and cabinets made from bamboo. She is also engaged in a hog raising business and is presently raising 13 piglets and one sow. Cristina currently spends her income on her hogs and basic necessities. Cristina would like to increase her profit in order to develop her finished products and thereby offer them at a higher price.

She lives together with Aurelio, age 57, with whom she has six children. She provided her children with education and raised them with good manners and good habits. She lives in her own house where she is now working hard to provide security for her old age. Every day, Doli gets up very early and takes care of the household chores. Once she has everything fixed up at home, she goes out to the market and buys well-chosen and fresh ingredients which she will use to prepare food. She has been doing this work for six years. She sells her meals from her home, and many people come each day in search of a plate of delicious and well-served food the way she knows how to provide it. She enjoys having this work very much, because it allows her to have control over her time during the day, since she only sells at night. During her years of work, she has been able to attract customers thanks to her good service, always provided with a smile. Now she has good sales and thus a good income. She hopes to continue to grow and expand with more tables and chairs to provide more comfort to her customers. This will be her eighth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support, since it lets her feel more secure in moving ahead with her business. At the same time, she is committed once again to fulfilling her payment schedule, as in her previous loans. She is also very grateful to be working with the members of her communal bank, since all of them are very responsible and have a strong sense of solidarity. With the amount she is requesting, 3000 Peruvian soles, she will buy ingredients and supplies to continue with her work, in addition to improving her business with more tables and chairs. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1001633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to prepare more food, as well as tables and chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-12T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-13T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":438.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":478.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":496.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":551.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.24},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":164.31,"local_amount":438.17,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":441.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386477},{"amount":179.61,"local_amount":478.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":482.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099581},{"amount":186.29,"local_amount":496.79,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":500.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713721},{"amount":187.6,"local_amount":500.25,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":504.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202614},{"amount":407.19,"local_amount":1085.85,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1094.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098298}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T21:22:32Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":389771,"name":"Macaes Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Macaes est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas trabajadoras y emprendedoras una de ellas es Karen Auxiliadora de 25 a\u00f1os quien tiene una pulper\u00eda.

They live in a house they own, located in the Uni\u00f3n America settlement of the district of Pichari. Ever since those lands were populated by settlers arriving from the highlands of Ayacucho, Huancavelica and Apurimac, many of them realized that agriculture was a potential way out of poverty. That's how they started to plant and sow the land, but there was an inconvenience that made it hard for them to take the produce to the markets, since they didn't have good access to roads. When Trinidad saw that the village had transportation difficulties, she decided to dedicate herself to transporting cattle and also to bringing essential goods for selling in her community. The cattle she took was slaughtered and soon sold. Meanwhile, she kept another group for breeding. In time, she was able to get a vehicle that makes transportation easier and saves time. Currently, Trinidad raises cattle, which has been going very well, and she also owns a small agricultural farm. In the future she wishes to keep on establishing more cacao crops. This is her second loan with MFP and she pledges to make her repayments in a timely fashion. She is happy with her communal bank, because everyone is punctual.

Because of that, she started her wholesale business. Her husband works in a tailoring workshop in the capital of the country, where she travels to sell cheese, dried beans and flour of high nutritional value. She markets these products in different food stores on credit and receives monthly payments for her work. She has a seasonal marketing strategy since she sells more cheese in the winter and more natural yogurt in the summer. Consequently she is now supplying capital to stock her inventory and travels every 15 days to the capital, since her products are in high demand.

She's a single mother of two children aged 19 and 8. Ever since she's been single, she has provided them with an education and has always devoted herself to fulfilling their needs in order to improve their living conditions. She lives in her parents' house and her biggest wish is to see her children become professionals. Every day Gissela goes out to visit her various friends, neighbors and relatives in order to sell some of the cosmetics and perfumes she offers. On some occasions, she waits for them at her home, but since she is a dynamic woman who doesn't like doing nothing, she prefers to go out in search of customers. She has been in this line of work for 10 years and she does it alone, because she has learned to get things done without help from anyone. During her years of work, she has learned a lot, such as how to approach customers and how to convince them to buy an article. She's very thankful to be doing well, because she's aware that it takes a lot of work in order to succeed in this business. She hopes to be able to continue working hard and to expand into a cosmetics store where she can get better profits. This will be her 8th loan with MFP and she's glad to know she will have financial support, since it will give her confidence to expand her business. On the other hand, she pledges to once again make her repayments, as she has done in her previous loans. Besides, she reports that she's happy in this group, because she's been a member for a long time. She teaches the new ones how to work as a team and how to be responsible , which they all are.

She is married to Simon, who is employed. She lives in her own house with her husband and 27 year old daughter. Lastenia sells grocery staples in a store installed in her house where she waits on customers who are largely her neighbors. She does so in a cordial and friendly manner. During the 5 years she has been working in her store, she has done so alone and only occasionally supported by her husband in his free time.\r\n\r\nLastenia likes her work since it enables her to remain comfortably at home and it generates income that helps her husband with household expenses.  On the other hand, she does not like it when some of her customers are late paying on credit extended to them. But this does not discourage her and she continues working with the same enthusiasm. Now she plans to expand her business. \r\n\r\nThis will be loan number 10 with MFP. Consequently she hopes for your collaboration so she can concretize her plans. As well she enjoys her communal bank since she likes the work it is doing to help people advance in their businesses.

She runs her business out of her home and works Monday through Sunday from 5:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.  She is very responsible and hard-working, and plans to use the loan as investment capital to build a food stall.  She is very grateful for the confidence shown in her and for the opportunity to grow her business, since this is the sole income for maintaining her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":1001752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To build a food stall.\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T10:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T10:00:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":44.1},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":56.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.1},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.32},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":43.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263295212},{"amount":44.1,"local_amount":44.1,"processed_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270014481},{"amount":44.15,"local_amount":44.15,"processed_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:23:43Z","rounded_local_amount":44.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276623460},{"amount":47.39,"local_amount":47.39,"processed_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":47.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283115464},{"amount":48.32,"local_amount":48.32,"processed_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":48.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099840},{"amount":50.25,"local_amount":50.25,"processed_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":50.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294318917},{"amount":52.53,"local_amount":52.53,"processed_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301375626},{"amount":53.91,"local_amount":53.91,"processed_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":53.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308134444},{"amount":56.92,"local_amount":56.92,"processed_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:52:26Z","rounded_local_amount":56.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315370233},{"amount":58.68,"local_amount":58.68,"processed_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":58.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322979168}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T01:15:17Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:22:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":391376,"name":"Phloan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phloan is  44 years old and in a hog-raising business.

He lives with his wife and his three young children in a house which they built with a lot of hard work in a rural village called \"Tierra Rajada\", in the district of Olmos. It is located approximately an hour away from the province of Chiclayo and the department of Lambayeque. As they are rural areas they still do not have basic services.\r\n\r\nAs the area where Tomas lives is entirely agricultural and livestock based, he has spent the last six years making a living buying and selling animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and others. He travels round the annexes of his hamlet buying animals to later raise or resell in various cities such as  Trujillo and Chiclayo. Tomas has managed to make a large numbers of regular customers who he must supply for weekly or fortnightly. For this reason he works with either cash payments or credits. His wife looks after their young children and raises smaller animals such as poultry in appropriate places in their own house.\r\n\r\nTomas hopes to continue growing and providing for all his customers. He thinks it is necessary to extend his business and for this reason he is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for the amount of 2000 PEN.

It can be stir-fried, steamed, boiled, or lightly fried in oil. \r\n\r\nShe sells her product to market stalls that she regularly supplies and to the local community.  She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy farm inputs for her business. Part of the loan will go to the maintenance of her farm. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEmelyn dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Apart from being happy and friendly, she is separated from the father of her children. She lives together with her eight year old son, and is both mother and father to him, living in her own house. Jessica makes a living selling live chickens. For this she buys them from the poultry farmers who raise them and she takes them in cages to sell them by the river. She has to make short journeys by boat along the river, to reach the hamlets on the banks of the river, to sell them to the inhabitants of these places. \r\n\r\nShe has made a living in this business for the last eight years. She is well known by the inhabitants of the area who wait for her products, as she is the only one who comes. She likes her business as it allows her to receive an economic income as well as making journeys and visiting new places. As well as being profitable due to the price that she sells at in these areas. On the other hand, she doesn't like the fact that some of her chickens die on the journey which cause her some loss. But she is not discouraged by this and wishes to continue in her business and also extend it by taking other products with her, such as clothing to sell. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan with MFP. Therefore, she requests a small loan to be able to fulfil her objectives. Apart from this she is happy with her communal bank as she appreciates the help she is receiving to move forward with her business.
