Her children are both currently in school.  Norma's business is selling vegetables in the town market in her area.  She is very well known because she always has a variety of fresh vegetables at a good price.  She is an incredible woman who works hard to provide her children with their daily bread.  Every day, she gets up very early in the morning to go and buy her vegetables from the central market in the country's capital city because there she has access to a large variety of fresh vegetables at very good prices.  Her dream is to provide her children with better living conditions than those she had.  She does not lose hope of seeing her children become professionals.  Norma is not unconcerned by her financial situation as things are becoming increasingly difficult and needs are increasing over time.  This has led her to take the decision to invest in her business so that she will have the ability to deal with greater demand.  This will allow her to keep her business active for longer, given that it is her main source of income.  Right now, Norma does not have the money she needs to make this investment.  For this reason, she has decided to request a loan from INTEGRAL to invest in buying a variety of vegetables wholesale (carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, chilis, chayotes, etc.)  This will allow her to attract more customers and thereby make more income with which to achieve her dream."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":1002184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, chilis, chayotes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T16:10:02Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Dalila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2012-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2013-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.46},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.19},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.13},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.37},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.03,"local_amount":34.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241357},{"amount":37.03,"local_amount":37.03,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966308},{"amount":38.38,"local_amount":38.38,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":38.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573595},{"amount":37.59,"local_amount":37.59,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319172},{"amount":41.75,"local_amount":41.75,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":41.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049468},{"amount":661.22,"local_amount":661.22,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":661.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521110}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T19:37:24Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":391443,"name":"Ayuru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ayuru is a 39-year-old married woman with four children; all of them are in school.

And in the afternoons, she takes care of her fields of corn, potatoes and peas that she grows in the two parcels of land that her family has. She tells us that in this agricultural season she planted a larger quantity and had to rent two more parcels of land. After the harvest, she sells the vegetables in the market in the city of Tambo. She is grateful for her mother, who gives her the strength to finish her degree. Her mother takes care of the animals that they own. They have various cows that produce milk, which they sell to a cheese supplier. They earn a good daily income from this, which helps minimize the household expenses. \r\n\r\nFlor belongs to the communal group \"mujeres luchadora\" (fighting women) and this is her first loan with MFP, where she hopes that her contribution will help her further her objectives. On the other hand, she promises to follow through with completing her payments. Furthermore, it pleases her to be a part of a communal bank, as all of the members are responsible and supportive people. If Flor receives this loan, she will invest the money in the purchase of natural fertilizers, which she will spread among her quinoa and corn. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1001711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"buy natural fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-13T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-14T17:30:03Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":738.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446511}],"funded_date":"2012-02-13T19:20:03Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Burns","image":972677}},{"id":389810,"name":"Karina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karina, de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, es una mujer trabajadora y decidida, adem\u00e1s de ser alegre y amable.

With her savings and income, her sales went up, and with her capital she was able to buy a plot of land. She is planning to construct her living quarters there little by little because this is a family aspiration. Thus she believes she will continue to take out Kiva loans and, logically, to keep making the payments as required. \n\nCurrently she is applying for a new Kiva loan with which to purchase soft drinks and other beverages in greater quantities.

He is an IDP (internally displaced person) who lives in Bilasuvar IDP Settlement with his wife and son. He is a farmer who has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 10 years. He chose this business because it is profitable, and fresh crops are often in high demand. People use fresh vegetables every day and consider them healthy. Many national dishes such as pilau and dolma are made of vegetables. Fresh fruits serve every table in Azerbaijan and are also used to make fresh punch.\r\n\r\nAli sells his crop in the Bilasuvar central bazaar. His monthly income is 230 AZN.

He has thought a lot about how to grow his business and has reached the conclusion that the best thing would be to invest in buying the supplies that he needs wholesale.  This will enable him to increase his sales capacity and deal with greater demand.  He is requesting this loan from INTEGRAL so that he can carry out his plan of investing in his business, buying the supplies he needs such as carrots, vinegar, onions, cauliflower, jalape\u00f1os, beets, cabbage, etc.  He trusts in God and believes that, through his work, he will obtain good results which will enable him to provide his family with better opportunities in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1002196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy

He currently lives in his own home which he worked very hard to build.  He lives with his wife and three children, and he is responsible for supporting the family.  Oscar lives in a small community called \"Mochumi\".  It is a rural place which is home to approximately 100 families and is located in Chiclayo province, in Lambayeque department.\r\n\r\nOscar's business is selling bicycle and motorcycle parts.  He makes his sales from a space that he has set up in his own home and he has been in his business for approximately three years.  Oscar tells us that the idea to set up this business came about during a conversation with his wife.  They have always been alert as to how they can get ahead and improve their children's education and food.  As Oscar lives in a rural area, the need for motorcycle parts is continuous.\r\n\r\nThe amount that Oscar invested in his business was not enough to deal with the demand that he is currently experiencing.

This family live in their own home in San Carlos neighborhood, in Chahchamayo province.  Jesusa is a keen and hard-working young woman.

When she has time, mainly on the weekend, Jesusa heads to her farm to weed or fertilize her crops.\r\n\r\nJesusa has a young son and, for his sake, she hopes to achieve her goal which is to grow her crops in larger quantities because coffee sells very well during the months of March and April.  This will be the first time that Jesusa has received a loan from MFP.  For this reason, she pledges to be punctual in making her monthly repayments.

Yolanda, his wife, and his 3-year-old daughter Estefany are his biggest treasures.

He has worked as a farmer for 10 years and knows that it is for him.  \"I grow Yungay, Andina and Jilgero potatoes because there is a constant demand for them\", he says.\r\n\r\nFidel's plots of farmland are located over two districts.  In Palcamayo he has plots in 5 different places and in Palca he has 5 lots.

He pays his laborers 25 soles a day each.\r\n\r\nFidel sells his harvests in the wholesale market in Tarma.  Each sack of potatoes costs an average of 35 soles.  However, bearing in mind that his harvests reach 800 sacks a year, his income is sizable.\r\n\r\nThanks to how well his business is going, Fidel is planning to acquire a new plot of land so that he can produce other varieties of potato.

She makes ladles, mortars and other wooden kitchen utensils.  She buys 'Diablo Fuerte' (Devil Strong) wood which is what should be used for making these items.  She has been in this business for three years and she sells her products in the city of Huancayo.  \"I have orders for 1,000 to 2,000 ladles a fortnight,\" she says.

Yolanda goes further in insuring a quality product by packaging it in light-weight PET jars that are easily recycled or reused, rather than bulky and breakable glass jars. For some time she has used her own kitchen to produce her sauce, however, recently she has been given the opportunity to use a commercial kitchen through a local business incubator. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Yolanda operates without any employees and still maintains a full-time job at EmblemHealth. In the near future, she hopes to grow her business to the point where she can bring on new employees and become self-reliant.

But when classes start up again, the concurrence of people increases, and with that her sales increase.\r\nEl\u00edas is a man who worked hard in his younger years.  He now receives retirement and can live peacefully.  That is how this family lives.  Aurelia hopes to expand her business, to purchase more merchandise to supply her demanding clientele.

Previously she lived in the city of Ayacucho but for various reasons decided to move to the coast of Peru, to Ica.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth was abandoned by her partner, she became very strong and decided to get ahead with her little ones.  This is why she has worked for two years selling gelatins in the street, only in the summer season, and when we are in winter, she works selling cakes.\r\n\r\nElizabeth tells us that she is very well at the side of her little girls.

She knows that her job is exhausting but she always is ready to continue selling.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Kiva lenders she will be able to buy a refrigerator, which will help her make her gelatins, because she constantly asks her neighbor to put them in hers, a service for which her neighbor charges.  This is why she prefers to begin paying for something of her own, and have the refrigerator available whenever she needs it.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to open a small business where she can sell school supplies because the school year is approaching.  She also wants to continue selling her gelatin and for her children to grow up strong and

Today Chincha is an amazing mix of cultures, with a large African-Peruvian population due to its indigenous past and the influence of the Spanish Empire.

Berta lives in her own home together with two of her children, with whom she shares the joy of educating two of her grandchildren.  Every day, Berta gets up very early and does her housework.  When she is finished, she starts selling lubricants to her waiting customers.  Her customers are mainly motorcycle taxi drivers or the vehicles' owners themselves.  Her business premises are located in her home and she has worked there for two years with the help of her son who carries out oil changes.  Berta really enjoys her work as it allows her to have time free to spend on other activities.  Owing to her good customer service, she has managed to gain a number of customers.

This area is known for its rich, pre-colonial culture and its handicrafts which are well known both at home and abroad.  It is home to the famous Panama hat.\r\n\r\nThis group decided to get together three loan cycles ago and form a loan group.  It has been very useful to them as they have used their loans to improve their small businesses and their lives in general.  The members are engaged in different business activities including animal raising, general commerce and other activities.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Rosa who is 51 years old and married.  She had nine children from her marriage but two of them died.  Her youngest child is 16 years old and in school.  He still lives with her.  Her husband doesn't work for health reasons.\r\n\r\nRosa sells all kinds of clothes.  She makes her sales door to door and also sells from home where some of her customers come to buy.  She works every day, for two or three hours a day.  On weekends she works all day because on those days, in addition to selling, she also collects payment for goods she has left on credit.  She buys her merchandise in Manta or Guayaquil.  She has a lot of customers as she has been in this business for some years.\r\n\r\nRosa will use this loan to buy seasonal clothing such as swimsuits, shorts, t-shirts, blouses etc. as she has several orders.  This is her third loan through her community bank.  She is the group's president and she likes it because of the help that she receives from the institution.\r\n\r\nRosa's dream is to own a car with which to make her sales.\r\n\r\nIn the group photo, there is a member whose face cannot be seen because her daughter is covering it.  For this reason, we have added a small photo of the lady.

He lives with his wife and their three minor children.  They have their own house, which was built from the foundation of his work.  The house is in the rural settlement of Santa Rosa de Yaranche in the Tambogrande district, which belongs to the Piura province.  It is approximately three hours from the Lampayeque department.\r\n\r\nManuel lives in an area where the primary business activities are farming and livestock.  These activities are not unusual for him.  He has 2.5 hectares of farmland where he continually plants his products according to the season.  His land is just a few meters from his home.  Therefore, it is easy to do the corresponding maintenance.  After having harvested his products, they are offered and sold at the markets in the area where he lives.  Or, in any case they will be taken to other wholesale markets.\r\n\r\nHis wife helps with the support of the household by selling poultry.\r\n\r\nManuel knows that it is time to make his lemon plants produce.

The total average monthly income of the family is 310 Laris, including the monthly pension of Maguli\u2019s mother-in-law. According to Credo estimations, Maguli\u2019s family belongs to the subsistence poor.\r\n\r\nMaguli requested credit in the frames of the Kiva start-up program for purchasing a car. She will be able to take hens with this car to nearby villages and sell them at retail prices.

They have a small house in a rural village called \"Sialupe Baca de Punto 9\" which is located some 20 minutes from Lambayeque district, which is 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  The people in Cristina's village mainly work in farming and livestock raising.  It is a developing area and, right now, the only basic service they have access to is electricity.\r\n\r\nCristina's daily business is raising and selling animals such as cattle, sheep, farmyard birds (ducks and turkeys), guinea pigs, etc.  This is a business that she has always worked in and she has approximately 10 years experience.  She inherited the business from her parents who taught her, from a very early age, how to buy and sell animals.  She has set up spaces on her property where she raises these animals.  In addition, Cristina also makes daily income selling 'chicha de jora' (a traditional, corn-based drink).  Her children and husband work together with her in undertaking new family projects.  They work every day to achieve their goals and thereby improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nCristina has clear and established goals.  She would like to buy nutritionally-balanced feed which she will use to fatten her animals.  She will also buy ingredients for making more 'chicha de jora'.  Cristina has requested a loan for 700 soles from Edpyme Alternativa which will help her to make more income.  This will enable her to improve her quality of life and also repay her loan.\r\n\r\nCristina has been an entrepreneurial woman since she was very young thanks to the values that her parents instilled in her.  These values are now recognized by her neighbors who have a great deal of admiration for her because she is always looking out for her family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":1002948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy nutritionally-balanced animal feed and supplies for producing 'chicha de jora'","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T17:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T17:40:01Z","loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":59.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.65},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2012-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2012-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.75},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.46},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.95},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.76},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":23.55,"local_amount":59.95,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":63.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012126},{"amount":24.61,"local_amount":62.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621242},{"amount":25.4,"local_amount":64.65,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332613},{"amount":26.01,"local_amount":66.2,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":69.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423402},{"amount":27.07,"local_amount":68.9,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:39Z","rounded_local_amount":72.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316799},{"amount":27.46,"local_amount":69.9,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":73.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373643},{"amount":28.95,"local_amount":73.7,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":77.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308384912},{"amount":29.76,"local_amount":75.75,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":79.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368509},{"amount":30.58,"local_amount":77.85,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":82.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977589},{"amount":31.61,"local_amount":80.45,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":84.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331114838}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T18:39:59Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":391836,"name":"Blanca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Blanca is a 42-year-old bakery owner.

She is married to 61-year-old Estanis and the couple have four children who they raised and educated.  Their children are now independent and upstanding citizens.  Lorreine lives alongside her husband in their own home where they share their days and their desire to work hard in order to achieve a better quality of life.  When any of her neighbors, friends or family members need to buy good designs and very fashionable clothes at a good price, they come to Lorreine's house because there they find the best clothing designs and brands.  Lorreine makes her sales on credit or for cash, according to her customers' preference.  In addition, she owns a farm.  She also goes there and to the neighboring villages to offer her clothes for sale.  She has been in this line of work for 2 years and it is doing very well because she has a lot of customers.  She almost never has any clothes left over.  This has helped her to increase her income and she makes further income because she works in a sawmill in the city.  Lorreine hopes to continue growing her business and to set up premises where she can display her merchandise more peacefully.\r\n\r\nThis will be Lorreine's 10th loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support as this will give her a guarantee that she can continue working peacefully.

He is single and doesn't have any children.  He is currently living in his parents' house and his parents support him financially.  They live in a poor urban village called Eureka which is located in Lambayeque district, 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.  It is a small village which is home to approximately 50 families who mainly work in agriculture.\r\n\r\nEduardo's parents taught him to work from a very young age.  He has now decided to focus on offering a passenger transport service between villages, though he sometimes makes longer trips when he is hired by regular customers who ring him up when they need his services.  The vehicle which Eduardo uses for his work is hired from a family member to whom he gives a fixed sum every day.  Eduardo has been in this business for three years and has saved up 65% of the value of a new vehicle.  He has decided to buy a new vehicle so that he can make more income and thereby improve his parents' quality of life as well as his own.\r\n\r\nEduardo has his parents' complete support in working in his own business.  He used to work as a farm laborer whenever he wasn't working in his vehicle.  This meant that he was able to save up the sum of money he currently has.  He now wants to add to this money in order to make his purchase.  For this reason, he decided to request a loan for 1,500 soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nEduardo has good personal and work references as he is an entrepreneurial young

Sadly, she also lost one of her children who left behind three orphans.  Magda raises them as if they were her own children.  They live together in their own home where Magda teaches them good habits every day\r\n\r\nEvery day Magda goes out to the market very early in the morning.  She goes looking for used clothing which she buys by the bundle and wholesale.  Once she has her products, she catches a vehicle or a boat, depending on where she is headed, and travels to the towns, farms or villages to offer her products for sale.  She sometimes exchanges her products for animals which she then takes back to sell in the city.  She has been in this business for 30 years and it has allowed her to raise and educate her children.  Her work is going very well as she always works as hard as she is able so that she can make enough income to meet her household's financial obligations.  In the future, Magda would like to have a grocery store in her home as she doesn't really enjoy having to travel because it is very heavy going.\r\n\r\nThis will be Magda's eighth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time as she has done with her previous loans.  Magda will use the 800 soles that she has requested to buy more used and new clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1003001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy used and new clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-14T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-15T18:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":122.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":126.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":135.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":143.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":146.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.07},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.96,"local_amount":122.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":123.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386508},{"amount":47.27,"local_amount":126.06,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":127.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099617},{"amount":47.07,"local_amount":125.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:11Z","rounded_local_amount":126.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713756},{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":135.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":136.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202649},{"amount":53.81,"local_amount":143.49,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":144.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098332},{"amount":55.1,"local_amount":146.94,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":148.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401116}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T19:52:55Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}}]}
