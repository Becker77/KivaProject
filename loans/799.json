She is married to 61-year-old William and the couple have six children who are already grown up and live independently.  Milena lives in her own home together with her husband.  They both work hard as they would like to be able to save up enough to enjoy a peaceful old age.  Milena always knew that she would have to work hard to enjoy a comfortable life.  For this reason, she started working 20 years ago when she opened her small but very well-stocked grocery store.  Over time, she expanded her business and decided to start selling gas canisters because there wasn't a business of this type in her area.  This allowed her to make good profits.  Later on, she also opened a tire repair shop.  This is a business that she carries out with the help of her husband.  Her husband does the work while she runs the business.  It is doing very well as they enjoy good sales and have a lot of customers.  Milena knows that everything she has achieved has been the result of her effort and a lot of sacrifice.  She hopes to continue making progress as she has many goals to achieve in her future and she doesn't plan to stop working.\r\n\r\nThis will be Milena's 14th loan from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support because this will make her feel more secure in making progress in her business.  For her part, she pledges once more to make her loan repayments in a punctual manner so that she doesn't let her group down.  Milena will use the 3,000 soles she has requested to buy a larger quantity of products for her grocery store.  She will also buy gas canisters to have in stock and materials and tools for her tire repair shop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1003025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy products with which to stock her store and gas canisters.

It is the area of the most rainfall in the country and therefore has a great abundance of water.\r\n\r\nIsrael works selling seafood; he begins his work day very early in the morning and ends mid-afternoon. He works with a friend, from whom he learned this craft 13 years ago.\r\n\r\nHe wants to invest in buying a good quantity of seafood and take advantage of the price of this season. This way, he will be able to generate higher income. It is his second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which is the institution that will broker between the lenders of Kiva at a worldwide level and Israel.

I sell each one for ten soles,\" she says. She gets 200 sacks of coffee from her coffee plantation, and each one of them is 60 kilos.

","en":"54-year-old Juan has a small factory where he makes 'bollos de maiz'.  He lives together with his wife and his three children who are 18 and 19 years old.  He dreams of seeing his children become successful professionals and this is what he is working towards.  Juan's business was born when, through family tradition, he started making 'bollos de maiz' (a corn mixture, wrapped in leaves and tied with twine), in order to support his family.  He has achieved his goal as he has one son who is nearly a professional and the other two are also on this path, in a field they enjoy.  Juan makes his sales from home, for cash and on credit.  He also has a sales location outside a very well-known supermarket in the city, near his production site.  Juan's goal is to further strengthen his business every day and for his children to become well-respected professionals.  His greatest challenge is a lack of sufficient working capital when faced with growing demand.  He would like to buy in larger volumes so that he can obtain discounts.  This is precisely why he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).

Her story begins when she was 22, and wasn't able to go to school, not even to a vocational school. But by means of a three-month course, she learned many things about sewing, which now has helped her to improve herself. \r\n\r\nShe works on her own, and doesn't have fixed hours. It is difficult for her when her small child is sick. She is married, and her husband is retired. She has five children who go to public school. \r\n\r\nHer dream, now that she has a lot of experience and several machines, is to have her own shop, since what the companies in the magazines pay for each article of clothing is little.

He is 41 years old and a widower. He lives with his young son in his own house, which was constructed on the basis of his labor. He lives in a rural village called Nueva Arica, which is located about 2 hours from the province of Chiclayo. The residents of the area in which he lives work totally in agriculture, livestock-raising, and handicrafts, among others. These are rural villages which are in the process of their development, so they only have basic electrical service.\r\n\r\nLeslier works daily to raise and later sell small animals such as ducks, turkeys, and hens, among others.

She is the mother of Meylin, who is 2 years old.  She lives in her own house along with her live-in partner, Carlos, who is 28 years old.  She wants to offer a better quality of life to her family.  This is why she puts a lot of effort into her work.  Janina's work consists of selling clothing and shoes.  For quite some time she suffered some setbacks in her life.  This is because she did not have her own monetary income for her house.  It is for this reason that she decided a year ago to begin a new project.  She thought that her friends, neighbors, or relatives would want to buy clothing garments or shoes depending on the current season.  It is in this way that she began her business that is now giving her very good results.  She likes what she does, because it allows her to have time to be able to be with her young daughter.  Furthermore, since she began her business, she has been doing well economically, since they have two household incomes.  She wants to continue growing, and that is why she has in mind increasing her sales and being able to offer a greater variety and quality of garments to her customers.  This will be the 3rd loan with MFP, so she expects their collaboration to continue with her objectives.  On the other hand, she promises to pay her dues again in a punctual manner and to demonstrate, as in previous opportunities, that she is a very good partner.  In this way she will reward the support that is offered to her by her communal bank, where everyone is very responsible and supportive.  With the amount requested, 1500 soles, she will buy more merchandise since she desires to supply her scholastic campaign and offer school uniforms and shoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy school shoes and school uniforms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":228.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":238.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":238.04},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":256.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":266.3},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":271.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.55,"local_amount":228.39,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":235.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386517},{"amount":91.59,"local_amount":238.94,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":246.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099626},{"amount":91.25,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":245.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713765},{"amount":98.42,"local_amount":256.73,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":264.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202658},{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":266.3,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":274.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098341},{"amount":104.11,"local_amount":271.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":279.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401125}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T06:33:06Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Dupre","image":170204}},{"id":392103,"name":"Leonarda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonarda is 51 years old and widowed with eight children.

She lives with her parents and three siblings who she supports in their own house, located in the area of Tambo. When she had only just finished school she studied a Systems Engineering degree, at the request of her parents. She admits that she never liked it, and has never worked in this activity. Instead she started to earn an income in the business of buying and selling clothes and beauty products, which she installed in her house. In the beginning she found it hard to find new customers. She went door to door with her products. Eventually and thanks to her hard work she made regular customers, who look for her and make orders.\r\n\r\nNow she has various orders for school uniforms. Things are going well for her; She decided to study a degree which she was interested in - \"Civil Engineering\". She has one year left to finish and already works in the local council as a works supervisor.

This city is noted for its warm climate, its beautiful beaches, its farming, and the generosity of its people.  In his free time, Luis really enjoys going for walks around the city.  \"It it is always good to clear your head a bit\", he says.  Luis is a father.  He has a 25-year-old son who helps him a lot in his business.  Like all good Peruvians, Luis enjoys food and one of his favorite dishes is the delicious 'arroz tapado' (molded rice with a ground beef filling).  Luis studied up to the fifth year of his secondary education but he would have liked to go on to study veterinary medicine.\r\n\r\nLuis' business is raising and selling pigs.  He gets up very early in the morning to work in his business as he must feed his piglets and clean out their pens so that they can grow healthily.  He spends around 15 hours a day in his work and can serve up to four customers a month.  However, over the Christmas and New Year period he always has an increase in his sale of pigs because of the festivities.  He believes that his business is going well because he puts a lot into his business and because he works with hygiene and good feed.  For this reason, his customers trust him.\r\n\r\nLuis is very, very grateful indeed to Kiva lenders because, with the help they provide, he will be able to buy vaccines for his pigs and improve the pens where they live.  This improvement will mean that his pigs will be free from illness and be raised in a better environment.  This, in turn, will mean his customers will trust him more and he will make more income so that he can continue working hard and doing well.  Above all, he would like to fulfill one of his dreams: \"to help with my grandchildren's

She lives in a traditional family setting with her children in her late husband\u00b4s place, in the Somono district of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Tata was unable to attend school because of social reasons; she briefly attended Koranic school before leaving at a very early age to help her mother with her business activities. She worked by her mother\u00b4s side for several years before getting married, and benefited from a good commercial education which would enable her to get along better in the world of small retail. Tata tried out several revenue-generating activities before settling on the buying and resale of clothing. She has been selling clothes for 9 years and enjoys a good reputation and a large client\u00e8le. Her high sales figures are due to the quality of her high end clothing.\r\n\r\nTata is requesting this loan in order to be able to meet her customer demand. She has been a member of Soro Yiriwaso for 54 months and is on her 4th individual loan, having already fully repaid 4 group loans and 3 individual ones. She plans to use this loan to buy a bale of pagnes (highly decorative and colourful West African fabric). She gets her supplies locally from the Compagnie Malienne des Textiles (COMATEX) in S\u00e9gou and sells her merchandise for cash or credit to a client\u00e8le composed of men and women. She anticipates earning a monthly profit of 80 000 FCFA, which will allow her to cover some of her expenses (clothing, soap and medicine). Her aim is to build a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":1006156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy some pagnes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-15T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-16T14:50:04Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.19},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757134},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251897},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410892},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449029},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502767},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502768},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268446},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498858},{"amount":93.19,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102906},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243179},{"amount":93.18,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":46465.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624766}],"funded_date":"2012-02-15T23:30:17Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:29:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":390021,"name":"Benson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benson is 64 years old and married to Pauline.

She lives with her parents in a large traditional family in the S\u00e9gou district of Sokala (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nAissa Kane left school in the 9th grade of fundamental class (Malian educational system) to work alongside her mother selling condiments, clothing and shoes. After several years of training, she branched out to conduct her own business activity and started to buy and sell potatoes, clothing, shoes, and school supplies at the start of the school year. She is highly skilled, and has enjoyed great notoriety and reputation over the past 12 years. \r\n\r\nIn order to bolster her working capital and increase her profits, she turned to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso six and a half years ago.

She lives together with Juan, her husband of 23 years.  The couple have six children, five of whom still live with them in their own home, in the town of Jatumpampa.  Mar\u00eda's main business activity is sowing tubers.  She grows potatoes, corn, olluco (a native tuber) and peas.  She has been working in this business for 20 years and her vast experience has helped her to save up the money she needed to buy her own farmland.  However, she admits that she needs still more plots of land for her crops and so every year she hires land and thereby enables her production.  Mar\u00eda very much enjoys her work.  It makes her feel alive and very peaceful, above all right now when she is experiencing some very bad problems.  However, she does not become discouraged, she knows that life goes on and she would like to do well for her children's sake.  Every harvest time, Mar\u00eda sells her crops in the country's capital.  However, sometimes the buyers come to her and buy her entire harvest.  In addition, Mar\u00eda also raises animals such as sheep which she sells when the need arises and sometimes uses for her own consumption.  \r\n\r\nMaria belongs to the 'Jatumpampa al Progreso' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

She enjoys belonging to her community bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive people.

Her highest monthly expenses are food, school fees, and rent. She rents a house that has electricity but no piped water. Mwanaisha will use the 20,000 KES loan to purchase more lesos for resale. Mwanaisha aspires to expand her business in the future. She joined Yehu because it offers quality financial services.

She\u2019s been working in agriculture since she was very little, cultivating cocoa, coffee, bananas and citrus. When she was young, she\u2019s travelled to Lima with the purpose of finding better living conditions, and there she met her husband. Soon after, things went badly in Lima because the country was going through political instability, so they decided to move back to Pichari. In Pichari, they began cultivating cocoa and coffee and both products are in considerable demand in the outside market.\r\n\r\nValentina is happy with her line of work because it generates an optimal return.

She lives with Victor, her husband of 23 years. They both have 8 children, but only live with 4 of them in their own house located in the annex of Ahuaycha. She owns various houses. Her motto is \u201chard work\u201d, so she doesn\u2019t rest. She has several lines of work that help her get ahead. In the morning, she bakes bread in the artisanal oven she built. She has a baker who helps them. With their car, her husband transports the bread to various townships in the area. They also own an omnibus that provides public transportation on the Acraquia-Pillo route, two townships that are well-travelled for economic reasons. They hired a driver from that area who administers the earnings with his son. That business does very well because there is almost no competition.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, her daughter-in-law tends to the grocery store that they have in their house and where they sell everyday items. As well as the animals that they breed, they have big and healthy corral chickens that they sell at every possibility. They also have 100 pigs that they distribute in diverse small houses, separated by adobe according to age and sex; after fattening them up, they cook the meat and sell it as \u201clechon\u201d (suckling), a food that is consumed in this area. \r\n\r\nThis is the 4th loan from MFP, where she is happy to receive the financial support to get ahead with her business.

He lives together with his wife and two children in a rented house, in Chilca district.  The city of Huancayo is very big and there is an awful lot of traffic.  For this reason, the locals travel around in taxis.  Rufo saw this need as an opportunity.  Four years ago he started offering a transport service with a car that he had just acquired and turned the car into his work tool.  Every day, from very early in the morning, he drives round the streets of his city in search of customers who ask him to transport them to different parts of the city.  He charges according to the distance traveled.  \"If the trip is in an urban area, I charge less but from cone to cone [outlying district to outlying district] the price is much higher\", he says  Rufo considers his work to be profitable because the service he offers is very much in demand.  In addition, he always tries, as far as possible, to cover the urban areas because in his business this means that he prolongs the life of his vehicle and delays wear and tear.  Rufo would like to improve his business and own an additional car so that he can make better profits.\r\n\r\nRufo is a member of the \"Las Emprendedoras\" community bank and this is his 19th loan from MFP.

The couple have three children but only live with two of them (who are 13 and 10 years old).  The family live in their own home which is located in the indigenous community of Palomar, in R\u00edo Negro district, in Satipo province.  Ismael is committed and meticulous in his work.  His business is farming.  Over three 'cuadras' (unit of measurement for agricultural land), he grows corn, coffee and cacao.  The coffee and cacao make him the most income but they are annual whilst the corn is harvested every four months and this is the crop that gets him out of some tight spots with debts or daily expenses.  He started out in this business when he was very young.  At 20 years of age, he already had his own farmland.  Coffee is his specialty.

In his small shop he mainly does repairs on sound systems and televisions. His customers are located in the neighborhoods near his business, where he goes around offering his services and little by little has gained new customers. He does business strictly for cash only. He started his business after having experience working in a shop of a well known business, where he worked as a electronics technician. His entrepreneurial drive led him to open his own business and today his dream is to grow his business, but his working capital is insufficient for the size of his goal.
