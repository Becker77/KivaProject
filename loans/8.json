Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

To help the finances of her family, she also sells all kinds of assorted drinks including minerals and some locally-made drinks such as kasapreko, oprim quansah, and schnapps.\r\n<p>\r\nOne challenge that Madam C. faces is that she always runs out of drinks because she has to make an advance payment before she receives the shipment from her suppliers. Her suppliers include the Coca Cola company of Ghana and the Ghana Breweries.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is therefore asking for a loan of US $1,000 to enable her to buy more crates of minerals (Malta Guinness, Coca Cola, Fanta, and Sprite) to fill her drinking spot attached to her chop bar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":93099,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more crates of minerals (Malta Guinness, Coca Cola, Fanta, and Sprite) to fill her drinking spot attached to her chop bar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2007-12-06T16:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-20T22:17:04Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":983.23,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.46},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.47}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143,"local_amount":140.6,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T11:15:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-07T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":140.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129962},{"amount":143,"local_amount":140.6,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T13:53:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-07T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":140.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154988},{"amount":143,"local_amount":140.6,"processed_date":"2008-04-14T12:47:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-07T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":140.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182638},{"amount":143,"local_amount":140.6,"processed_date":"2008-05-12T12:36:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-07T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":140.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":208619},{"amount":428,"local_amount":420.82,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T14:13:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-07T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":420.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288115}],"funded_date":"2007-12-06T22:17:04Z","paid_date":"2008-08-06T14:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30489,"name":"Relina Vasco Cumbe","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Relina Vasco Cumbi, 44, lives with her husband and 8 children in Maputo, Mozambique.

Having left junior high school in the final year, he tried his hand unsuccessfully at various incoming-generating activities. He eventually decided to start buying and selling electrical goods (TVs, radio hi-fis, DVDs, VCDs, solar panels, satellite dishes, etc.) three years ago now. He enjoys a well-established reputation and receives a lot of orders, particularly from young people. In his search for financial assistance he is requesting the help of Soro Yiriwaso, with whom this will be his first individual loan. This will allow him to buy 2 TVs, 3 radio hi-fis, 2 solar panels, 2 satellite dishes, 2 DVDs, 3 VCDs and 100 CDs in order to meet ever-increasing customer demand. He gets his supplies in Accra (Republic of Ghana) and sells them on at his video store in Wayerma. He both sells and rents out equipment. Some of his customers pay in cash and others by credit. He intends to bring in a monthly profit of 200,000 CFA francs using this loan. Having achieved his profit target he hopes to make back the bulk of his outgoings, including family expenses, pay off the interest on his loan, and invest the rest in his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eleanor Stilgoe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":299840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of electronic equipment (TVs, radio hi-fis, CDs, DVDs and VCDs, solar satellite panels, satellite dishes etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oumar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621209},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:20:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020170},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242924},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242925},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678633},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112541},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028134},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873509},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763257},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-27T11:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25813.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152067}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T01:52:04Z","paid_date":"2010-02-27T11:10:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Stilgoe","image":253774}},{"id":104240,"name":"Jowena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jowena C. is a farmer.

She is 59 years old. Pablita is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Pablita owns & operates a business venture providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from hauling scrap metal for local businesses and community members. Pablita has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pablita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pablita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Pablita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Pablita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In Bayan-Ulgii province, there is much demand for their businesses as many residents live in gers and use firewood to heat their gers (Mongolian felt tent homes). Purevjav and her husband hire a driver and large truck, travel to a nearby forest, collect old wood, and transport it to the province center to sell. Her husband started his carpentry business in 2000 but already had much experience in the production after helping his father in the business since he was a child. Today, their businesses are very popular among the locals. For the future, Purevjav and her husband hope to start a small ger wall and supplies factory, as he has experience producing these products.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store and a videoke place. Videoke is the local term for karaoke to distinguish that the singer can actually follow the lyrics on a TV screen as opposed to the old karaoke which only played the music and the singer used a songbook to view the lyrics.\r\n\r\nLucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 in the hope that she would be able to help improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by running a general store and a videoke place. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 6,400 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nLucia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 10,000 was used to fund operations of her videoke and general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 10,000 for her 18th loan which she intends to use to maintain her videoke machine and sustain her general store.\r\n\r\nLucia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":483993,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nSaili  joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saili 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Saili  Taupou are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

selling vegetables and spices. She lives in Narra, Palawan. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own efforts, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. \r\n\r\n<p>Teresita's previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,600, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she will use to buy stocks of vegetables and spices to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business improvements. Teresita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Como hija de agricultores; comenz\u00f3 con el sembr\u00edo de caf\u00e9, palta y tang\u00fcelo en los terrenos heredados de sus padres, de eso hace m\u00e1s de 8 a\u00f1os. Su buena disposici\u00f3n en el trabajo y la entrega de su esposo por seguir adelante la impulsaron a ahorrar el dinero que recib\u00eda de las ventas de sus cosechas a los acopiadores de la zona. Con ello pudo abrir una farmacia hace 5 a\u00f1os. Paralelo a este negocio, tiene una casa que hace poco termin\u00f3 de construir y donde arrienda habitaciones para estudiantes y peones que llegan a la zona. Asimismo alquila en una parte de su casa, un restaurante a terceras personas, obteniendo de ello un dinero extra cada mes.

She is part of a strong, close knit family that is made up of her husband Roy with whom she has been married 20 years.  They have 2 children, Pol and Kiefen,  who they care for and protect.  As a daughter of farmers she started planting coffee,avocados and tangerines on the land she inherited from her parents more than 8 years ago.  Her willingness to work and her husband's dedication to getting ahead prompted her to save the money she received from her crop sales to the middlemen in her region.  With her savings she was able to open a drug store 5 years ago.  Along with her business, she has a house that they recently finished building where she rents rooms to students and laborers that come the region.  She also rents part of her house as a restaurant to three people for extra income every month.  Her main concern is her working capital since every 5 months she invests an average of 5,000 nuevos soles [Peruvian currency] in stock for her drug store. This doesn't discourage her from striving toward her goal to be able to be profitable enough to generate her own capital.  She also thought it would be advantageous to have her own restaurant because she thinks it will be more profitable.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs the communal bank \"Flor de caf\u00e9\" and this is her sixth loan with MFP.  She is happy to receive the financial support that is much needed.  She is also committed once again to making her payments on time as she did with previous loans.

It is a shoe store.  He started worked in workshops when he was twelve. As time went on the workshops began to have great losses and closed. It was then that he decided to start his own business outside of the Santos Barcenas market, since there is more traffic there.  The loan is for resources for work -- he needs to be able to purchase waxed thread, glue, and proper shoe soles, which are bought in Managua because wholesale is more convenient for him.

She has three grown children who are working and supporting the family.  She joined TYM Fund in 1999.  With her loan, she and her husband invested in expanding her pig raising business.  Additionally, she also works as a sanitation worker so her family has a stable income from her salary.  Currently, her family's income grosses at 5,000,000 VND per month.

He is 37 years old and lives in Nabatieh, Southern Lebanon with his wife and their two children. Marwan is special in his work because he opened his bakery in front of a school. His clients are mainly students as well as people from his region. He does \u201cmankoucheh\u201d. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza. The most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning. \r\n<p>\r\nMarwan decided on this business because he wanted to improve his financial situation.

They all live in her home made from simple materials and located in the popular Ventanilla district in Lima.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has a small shop in her home and has returned to it after three years, during which time she had to leave it aside. The convenience of having this business in her own home inspired her to continue with it, since it has been very profitable and can sustain her family. Mery can work in the comfort of her home and, at the same time, care for her younger children. Her husband, Oscar, also cheerfully helps with the work.\r\n<p>\r\nThe hardest time, according to her means \u201crun around more,\u201d is midday, since she has to attend to her customers on their lunch hour and also to her family. Mery attends the store almost the entire day and on weekends the hours can extend until midnight.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she thinks she will update the facilities in her business, stock it with more merchandise and eventually sell food from outside her home.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has already had 4 loans with MFP, and she has always liked collaborating with her communal bank, but for matters of time, she is requesting an individual loan this time.

Esterlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. She is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Esterlita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She works the farm every morning, growing platanos, citrus fruits and coffee, and she knows the quality of the crop depends on the care she takes.  What she most likes about farming is taking care of her crop and watching it grow by the day.  She's been a farmer for 10 years and says that the most difficult thing about farming is getting her crop to market.  She has to cart the crop to the town of Pichanaki because that's where she sells it, but the sacks are very heavy and difficult to move.  For the future, she wants to improve her crop so that she can ensure the best price for it.  This is Nermi's fourth MFP loan.  She knows that she has to repay it on time and is committed to doing so.  The members of her community bank consider her to be a reliable and responsible partner.  She will use this loan, for two-thousand new soles, to buy supplies of manure for improving her crop yields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":738687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of manure for farming business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-26T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nermi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245074}],"funded_date":"2011-03-26T19:03:43Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":289489,"name":"Choen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of four members who will each use their part of the loan for different purposes to improve their families' standard of living.

Constituye el centro administrativo, econ\u00f3mico y cultural de la regi\u00f3n, siendo la ciudad m\u00e1s importante del Valle Central chileno. Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Elena is a member of the communal bank \u201cCaminando Hacia el Futuro\u201d of Talca.  She has sold new clothing for 9 years and also works as a clerk in a factory.  She generally sells clothing according to the season and she sells underwear throughout the year.\r\n\r\nShe buys the merchandise in Arica, a city in the north of Chile.  Her daughter lives there and she takes advantage of that to travel to Arica three times a year to supply her business with clothing and bazaar products such as women\u2019s and children\u2019s key chains.  She says that the prices there for merchants are very good.\r\nHer work schedule is totally flexible since she fits it around her hours as a clerk.\r\nShe also has many customers who give her orders and Mar\u00eda Elena fills them when she travels to buy the merchandise.\r\nShe will use the money to buy exclusive clothing wholesale and will visit her daughter for New Years when she buys the merchandise.\r\nOne of her goals is to be independent and set up a permanent stand and possibly to have a bazaar or a boutique.  She lives together with her husband and her dreams are to prosper in the business.\r\nMar\u00eda Elena  is very happy and appreciative for the help offered her by Fondo Esperanza since it has allowed her to invest in her business and expand it.  She also feels very comfortable with the company and the assistance of the communal bank of which she is a member.  She says that it is a very committed and responsible group and  the trainings have helped her organize the accounting in her business.\r\n\r\nTalca is in the Maule region, located in the center of the country.  It is the commercial and cultural center of the region since it is the most important of the Chilean central valley.   There is a curious reference in Chile about Talca, the phrase \u201cTalca, Paris and London\u201d.  Some say it originates with the English saying, \u201cTalca looks like London\u201d because of the thick fog that frequently covers the city in the winter, as in the capitol of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":947304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy exclusive clothing wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T01:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":539348,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":24604},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":24839},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":25076},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":25315},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25557},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":25800},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":26047},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":26295},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":26546},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26800},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":27055},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":27313},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":27574},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27837},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":28103},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28371},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":28642},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28915},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":29191},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":29468}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.69},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.71},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":96.26,"local_amount":49443,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:50Z","rounded_local_amount":50062.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772364},{"amount":248.79,"local_amount":127795,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":129396.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180811},{"amount":207.71,"local_amount":106696,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:10Z","rounded_local_amount":108032.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315269},{"amount":215.76,"local_amount":110827,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":112215.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031455},{"amount":281.48,"local_amount":144587,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":146398.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643644}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T05:46:04Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":375576,"name":"Amna's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amna is 36 years old.

For the past ten year, she has been actively involved in mixed farming. Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cows, she is able to get between 10-15 litres of milk a day, and this helps her support her family. Teresa also practices crop farming. She has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. This is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through this loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and increased profit levels. Teresa is very visionary. Her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill.

She offered her services as a seamstress, and her love of doing this has helped her to go far.  She started making clothes for relatives and she soon acquired an industrial sewing machine with which she was able to increase production.  Fortunately she has a lot of clients and she makes some school uniforms.\r\n<p>\r\nEstela's effort has helped her to grow as a micro-businesswoman and she now has a lot of demand for school uniforms.  It is because of this that she is asking for a loan of $475 which she will use to buy materials.  She will repay the amount over a period of 6 months.  Today you can help someone who really needs it.  Estela and her family sincerely thank you.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/> <p>\r\n\r\nEstela es casada y tiene tres hijos de 16, 18 y 20 a\u00f1os de edad.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling grocery items. Genevieve has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 1,200 PHP a month for these activities. In 2000, Genevieve joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Genevieve has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Genevieve is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional grocery supplies. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Genevieve from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.

She began this business with an initial investment of 3,000 KGS and now she makes a monthly profit of 2,500 KGS. She would like to use her loan to purchase more convenience goods to increase the turnover at her kiosk.\r\n\r\nUmut has been in this business for ten years. Currently, she is living with her 36-year-old son and his wife. Her longer-term goal is to purchase cattle, since raising cattle would bring her much more profit.\r\n\r\nUmut has three partners:\r\n\r\nAs the treasurer of the group, 64-year-old, Zhumabubu T. has a family that has been breeding livestock for at least two decades. She herself is retired and is married with three sons and two daughters. All her children are older now and live separately with their families. Zhumabubu plans to use the loan to buy livestock.\r\n\r\nLike Umut, Azina N. sells convenience goods in a kiosk near her house. She has also been doing this for a decade and started with an initial 2,000 KGS investment. Today, Azina makes 2,000 KGS per month. She is 74, a widow, and has one son who works as a police officer. Azina will also use her loan to purchase convenience goods to increase her turnover. She dreams of someday going to a resort.\r\n\r\nTashbubu T. is a retired 69-year-old, but she sells milk to earn more money. She began selling milk twenty years ago. She started with 10,000 KGS and, through her profits, was able to marry off her first grandson. She has two children who live separately with their families, yet some of her grandchildren live with her. Tashbubu is also a widow and plans to use the loan to purchase farm animals to increase the number of livestock she owns. Her goal is to marry off her second grandson.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

For over three years she has been a seamstress.  She makes bases for hats and women\u2019s skirts among other typical items of clothing from her area.  She carries out these tasks with help from her work tool: a sewing machine.  Her customers supply the other supplies like fabric.\r\n\r\nShe states that she enjoys sewing because for her it\u2019s a hobby that also produces profits at the same time.  On the other hand, she also raises small farm animals and farms corn, lima beans and peas.  When planting and harvest times come is when the hardest effort is required to do a good job. The crops are sold in the city market.  For now, she\u2019d like to extend her fields as well as have a workshop with the latest model sewing machines to facilitate the jobs.\r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan with MFP.  She is happy to know that she can count on financial help since she has always been very responsible with her repayments.  In addition, she enjoys being part of a communal bank because all the members are responsible and mutually-supportive people.  She is grateful to all those who will fund the loan that will be very useful for her to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested funds to buy replacement parts and repair her sewing machine.

Jamila lives and works in Tyre.  She opened a small bakery in 1997, specialized in making  manaqish (Arabic: \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0634\u200e man\u0101q\u012bsh; sometimes called \u0645\u0639\u062c\u0646\u0627\u062a mu\u2018ajjan\u0101t 'pastry'), which is a popular Levantine food consisting of dough topped with thyme, cheese, or ground meat. Similar to a pizza, it can be sliced or folded, and it can either be served for breakfast or lunch. The word manaqish is the plural of the Arabic word manq\u016bshah (from the root verb naqasha 'to sculpt, carve out'), meaning that after the dough has been rolled flat, it is pressed by the fingertips to create little dips for the topping to lie in.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Levantine women would bake dough in a communal oven in the morning, to provide their family with their daily bread needs, and would prepare smaller portions of dough with different toppings for breakfast.\r\n\r\nJamila has 16 years in this field.  She started working when her husband died and she found herself alone and responsible for two children. Jamila is a hard worker, she's a person with good reputation and all of her customers and friends speak about her good manners and her shyness. They also described her courage when struggling to prove herself in front of her children and society. \r\n\r\nJamila is working on expanding her shop through adding upgraded machines that will help increase her income in less time.  She is also willing to do some small decoration to her shop. \r\n\r\nJamila will also buy a big tent that will expand her working area, and will be used to start a new business. She plans to start a hookah cafe.  Also known as a waterpipe, a hookah is a single or multi-stemmed (often glass-based) instrument for smoking in which the smoke is cooled and filtered by passing through water. The tobacco smoked is referred to as narghile or shisha (sheesha) in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. According to Cyril Elgood, who does not mention his source, it was Abu\u2019l-Fat\u1e25 G\u012bl\u0101n\u012b (d. 1588), a Persian physician at the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar I, who \u201cfirst passed the smoke of tobacco through a small bowl of water to purify and cool the smoke and thus invented the hubble-bubble or hookah.\u201d However, a quatrain of Ahl\u012b \u0160\u012br\u0101z\u012b (d. 1535) refers to the use of the \u1e21aly\u0101n, thus dating its use at least as early as the time of \u1e6cahm\u0101sp I (1524\u201376). It seems, therefore, that Abu\u2019l-Fat\u1e25 G\u012bl\u0101n\u012b should be credited with the introduction of the \u1e21aly\u0101n, already in use in Persia, to India. Smoking the hookah has gained popularity, especially in the Middle East and is gaining popularity in North America, South America, Europe and Australia.\r\n\r\nThis new business will provide her with extra income helpful for her family, Jamila has been a borrower in good standing  at Al Majmoua for ten cycles.  Each loan was requested to improve a specific part of her business. She hopes to continue expanding her

They all live in the city of Valpara\u00edso. \r\n\r\nBernardita, who is bent down in the photo and wearing an orange kerchief, works doing all types of crafts, including re-upholstery, pottery, work in leather, and work in wood. She also works on a loom and often uses recycled materials. She has had the workshop where she does her work for 9 years and they call it the \"multiple\" workshop because she of the diversity of artwork that she produces. To make her crafts, Bernardita buys wood at low prices, but most of her other heavy materials are recycled. \r\n\r\nShe takes commissions but also creates her own innovative work like wooden signs. With the loan, she will buy sandpaper, paint, wool, paint thinner, Betumen of Judea (used to create a patina effect) and will repair an electric tool that she uses in her artwork. \r\n\r\nHer goals are to continue developing classes and workshops to keep her craft skills up to date. Her dreams are also to share and transmit to the other members of the communal bank everything she has learned about crafts. She wants to continue being an artist and to continue working. Bernardita completed free classes in weaving with the Mapuche (indigenous people of Chile). She is very grateful for the opportunity that Fondo Esperanza has given her, not just for the loans but also for the values that Fondo Esperanza promotes, like solidarity and trust. \r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 kilometers northeast of Santiago. It is the regional capital and also the headquarters of the country's legislature.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Ti\u00ean tr\u00e0 04 (8).\r\n\r\nTr\u1ecdng is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Tr\u1ecdng owns and operates a waste-management business. Her main source of income comes primarily from hauling junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Tr\u1ecdng has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4,000,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nTr\u1ecdng joined SEDA in 2009 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,392,000 VND from SEDA that was used to purchase scrap metal to sell. She is requesting a new loan of 8,736,000 VND to purchase additional plastics and other recyclables to sell. This will be her third loan from SEDA.

loan capital, organizes them for group meetings and ensures that all repayment schedules are met accordingly.\r\n\r\nAbena is married and has five children who are between the ages of 10 and 17. She says all are in school.  Abena works very hard to support her husband in providing for the family.

On his farm, he has rice and also some cows and bulls. With the loan, he will buy fertilizer for rice farming as he hopes to increase his productivity. The fertilizer helps increase the yield per plot and it also provides rice of better quality. He dreams of fixing his home, which is made out of wood and is vulnerable to rains. On his farm he also has a couple of horses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. The loans  will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T04:20:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-04T02:10:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:22:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31430},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:20:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40404},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:41:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53266},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:19:04Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73629},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:34:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88532},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99028}],"funded_date":"2007-05-21T02:10:22Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14152,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"At forty-nine years old, Esther has six girl children and she also adopted two children from a deceased uncle.

Through leasing and leaseback, SELFINA provides a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. As they lack tangible collateral assets, they are termed not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client, extends a loan to her, then leases back the same equipment. The process is called a sale and leaseback

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 59 years old. Carolina is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarolina is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Carolina owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Carolina has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Carolina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carolina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Carolina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Carolina from PMPC.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Tafaoga has 1 year of experience in this business.  Tafaoga needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tafaoga joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tafaoga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tafaoga F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Bun S. currently makes wooden beds for sale. He sells his finished product to buyers who come directly to his house. He makes many sets of beds before selling out.

El pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de los insumos necesarios (ma\u00edz, arroz, queso, chicharon, tomates, repollos, etc.) para la producci\u00f3n y venta de las deliciosas pupusas. La se\u00f1ora expresa estar muy agradecida con esta instituci\u00f3n ya que en el pasado recibi\u00f3 la ayudo de dicha instituci\u00f3n para invertir en su negocio. Espera recibir resultados favorables en esta ocasi\u00f3n. \n\n","en":"Gilda is 64 years old and lives by herself in her own house. She has a shop where she sells pupusas [stuffed tortillas], which she has managed to set up in her home. She has many customers since she is a charismatic woman, hard-working, dedicated, and responsible. Many people give her a good reference since over time and through her work she has earned the confidence of her neighbors. Despite her age, she does not get tired of working, especially since her pupusa shop is her main satisfaction. Her business is located in a very accessible, high traffic area. Gilda is very enterprising, especially since she is always thinking of ways to increase her business. Her dream is to be able to respond to an increase in demand, which is why she has decided to invest in her business. Her goal is to improve her sales and revenues, which will allow her to enjoy a better quality of life. For this reason she has decided to request this loan from INTEGRAL, especially since she currently lacks the necessary capital to cover the investment. She will invest the loan by purchasing ingredients such as corn, rice, cheese, chicharr\u00f3n [pork skins], tomatoes, and cabbage, etc., which are necessary for the production and sale of her delicious pupusas. Gilda is very grateful to the institution for the help she received from it last year to invest in her business. She expects to have favorable results again.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":978840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corn, rice, cheese, chicharr\u00f3n [pork skins], tomatoes, and cabbage, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2012-01-14T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2012-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.01},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.3,"local_amount":32.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":32.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241329},{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":36.12,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966281},{"amount":36.31,"local_amount":36.31,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":36.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276573569},{"amount":38.12,"local_amount":38.12,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:36:35Z","rounded_local_amount":38.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283319146},{"amount":39.07,"local_amount":39.07,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":39.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287049442},{"amount":40.89,"local_amount":40.89,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":40.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294521086},{"amount":91.88,"local_amount":91.88,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":91.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301329728},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":49.36,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":49.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308349560},{"amount":50.99,"local_amount":50.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315320931},{"amount":49.21,"local_amount":49.21,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":49.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322929522},{"amount":35.75,"local_amount":35.75,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":35.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331924694}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T18:38:51Z","paid_date":"2013-01-19T10:04:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim O'Reilly","image":null}},{"id":383802,"name":"Allan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allan is 42 years old and lives in the Philippines.

town. He has been operating this business for over three years. He started the business with a start up capital of Ksh 10,000, which he acquired through a loan from a microfinance institution. Currently, the business has a working capital of over Ksh 20,000.\r\n<p>\r\nThe post election violence that rocked Kenya severely affected the western part of the country where his business is located. Forced to close down due to the violence, Edwin is now seeking a refinancing loan and an extension on his loan period in order to rebuild his business. His business is steadily picking up and he is working hard to maintain good customer relations with his key clients.

Sales are made at the house, door-to-door, and at the marketplace, cash or credit accepted from customers composed of men and women. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members envision realizing an average monthly profit of 22,500 francs CFA that will be used to make loan payments and to help cover family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":290127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments, peanuts, fonio, and potatoes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mah                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayon    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mach\u00e9   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mass\u00e9tou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033737},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621104},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020070},{"amount":116.68,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242815},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678431},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112463}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T02:05:18Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":100208,"name":"Mery Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mery es socia del Banco Comunal Azucenas.\nMery es casada, tiene 25 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Mery vende comida y gelatinas sus ventas los realiza en un terminal de buses de transporte urbano, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con el apoyo de su mama.\nMery necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 800 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Mery son construir su casa y tener un carro para que su esposo trabaje.\n","en":"Mery is a member of Banco Comunal Azucenas.

The 12 members of the group have chosen Lotty as their representative. Lotty and most of the group sell products such as groceries in neighborhood stores, food, clothing and shoes and the rest of the group work at different activities such as making wood furniture, public transportation and cutting hair in beauty shops. There is a lot of competition in the marketplace and the members have to try doubly hard to earn money for their households. For this reason they need financing which will help them grow their small businesses so that with more merchandise and working tools in good condition they can generate more income, thus providing a better standard of living for their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

By working hard in her general store and photography business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 28,000.\r\n\r\nAlicia is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can sustain her general store. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Alicia aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":509626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

M., 57, is married to Ricardo M., a farmer.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her fruit business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan to replenish and maintain her fruit inventory.

Mohira grew up in a home where the principal work was, and is, agriculture. She acquired skills in this field when she was very young from working with her parents. Agriculture has become her principal source of income and she dedicates most of her time to the attention and care of her agricultural products. Through her daily work, she looks to give her family security and economic stability. However, due to unexpected difficulties, she cannot cover all of her expenses, and she needs a loan to improve her products and increase her sales.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is from the village of San Roque, Enrile, Cagayan. She is 46 years old. Gemma is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Gemma operates a family member's business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 45 years old, is widowed and has two children. Julia's level of education is elementary school. \r\n\r\nShe has been working with field partner Movimiento Manuela Ramos for a year. Her initial loan was for 200 nuevos soles (PEN) which she used in her business selling clothes.

The population holds fast to their traditions of language and colorful dress. Little girls are traditionally not given the same opportunities as boys. The result is that about 70% of women have had no formal education and 30% were only able to study until the 4th or 6th grades.\n\nTen women have joined together to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEl Buen Beneficio\u201d and are so pleased to be able to access loans and sustain and expand their small animal husbandry businesses. The ladies raise animals like bulls, cows, pigs, turkeys and chickens. They sell their animals in a local market and in the nearby large market in Quiche. \n\nThe President of the group is 53 year old Isabel, who is the mother of nine children who range in age from 10-28. She has been able to afford to give all of them a primary school education. Isabel raises animals including cows, pigs, turkeys and chickens. She is requesting a loan to buy more animals as well as feed to fatten them up and then sell them. With her anticipated income, she will keep supporting the needs and education of her children and in addition, buy fertilizer for her corn and bean fields. \n\nThe women realize that having access to education is of great importance to success in the future. Since the vast majority of them have had no education at all, they understand this and are motivated to see their children stay in school as long as possible. The ladies feel fortunate to participate in educational trainings in their monthly meetings with a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. \n\nWith capital and education, the women are taking steps to create a more prosperous future for themselves and their families.
