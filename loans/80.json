Wainaina can be described as a very hardworking man.

This business was operational from 1998 to 2002. Apart from his business, N. is also a community worker within Kayole where he resides. He runs a small community based organization by the name of AIDS Link, and he is sometimes hired by NGOs and social work groups to assist in matters affecting his community. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough his hard work, and from the payments he received from the transport company, N. managed to save up Ksh 95,000 (US$ 1440), which he used to start off his kerosene-selling business. He has undergone several business management training courses and has gained a lot of experience, both from the dry cleaning business that he used to run and also from the kerosene business that he is currently operating. <P>\r\n\r\nN. wishes to expand his business. His vision for the business is to become able to sell on a wholesale scale in his area. His only difficulty is finances necessary to stock more kerosene, which is the main fuel used for cooking within his community. He is requesting a loan of US$ 800, which will be repayable within 12 months. The loan will enable him to expand his kerosene business and attract more customers, since he will have enough kerosene to meet the needs within his community. This will also enable him to make his prices more reasonable, a great advantage to his customers. The additional stock will also require him to employ 2-3 people from his community, to assist him in serving the customers. The additional loan will enable him to increase his income, hence improve his family\u2019s

a farmer without expansive fields, which inevitably means low earnings.  The house in which she lives is very simple and still in a semi-permanent state, although they own it free and clear.  For everyday expenses Putu Yasi needs Rp.20,000.  In order to get on top of these issues, Putu Yasi diligently began a pig breeding business three years ago.  With starting capital of only Rp.800,000, Putu Yasi bought one sow.  Every four months the sow gives birth to a litter of between five and eleven piglets, and after the piglets are two months old they are ready to be sold.  One piglets sells for Rp.200,000, so the earnings of the sale can reach Rp.2,200,000 (@200,000 x 11).  From that sale, profits can be up to Rp.700,000 every six months, after subtracting for the feed (Rp.1,500,000 every six months).  These profits are used by Putu Yasi to pay her children's school fees as well as to add to her house.  Putu Yasi is very pleased with the loan from Dinari, because with it, she can add to her business.  Now Putu Yasi has begun to fatten up two pigs, and the loan of Rp.1,300,000 will be used to puchase pig feed with the hope that the profits will be good and Putu Yasi's children can attend school through a higher grade level. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMenghidupi 3 orang anak yang kini sudah duduk dibangku sekolah merupakan hal yang berat bagi Ni Putu Yasi, apalagi suaminya hanyalah seorang petani yang ladangnya tidak begitu luas,otomatis penghasilannya pun tidak banyak.Rumah yang ditempatipun sangat sederhana dan masih dalam tingkat semipermanen,tetapi sudah menjadi milik sendiri. Sedang untuk keperluan sehari-hari Putu Yasi harus mengeluarkan uang sebesar Rp.20.000. Supaya masalah ini bisa diatasi maka sejak 3 tahun yang lalu Putu Yasi mulai menekuni usaha berternak babi.Modal awal hanya Rp.800.000,Putu Yasi membeli 1 ekor penginduk. Setiap 4 bulan sekali  babi penginduk ini melahirkan anak bisanya 5 sampai 11ekor,dan selang 2 bulan kemudian anak-anak babi ini sudah bisa dijual.Satu ekor  dijual seharga Rp. 200.000 ,jadi hasil penjulan semuanya sebesar Rp.2.200.000 ( @ 200.000 x 11 ). Dari penjualan ini keuntungan yang diperoleh sebesar  Rp.700.000 per 6 bulan ,setelah dikurangi biaya pakan sebesar Rp.1.500.000 selama 6 bulan.Keuntungan ini dipakai oleh Putu Yasi untuk biaya sekolah anak-anaknya juga untuk mencukupi keperluan rumah tangga. Putu Yasi sangat senang dengan adanya pinjaman dari Dinari,karena dengan adanya pinjaman ini Putu Yasi dapat mengembangkan usahanya karena sekarang Putu Yasi mulai memelihara babi penggemukan 2 ekor,dan pinjaman sebesar Rp.1.300.000 dipakai untuk membeli pakan ternak dengan harapan keuntungan yang didapat lebih banyak dan anak-anak Putu Yasi bisa sekolah ketingkat yang lebih tinggi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase feed -- Membeli pakan ternak","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu Yasi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T04:32:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-25T10:22:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86408},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100254},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:10:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119055},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138517},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164674},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-25T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-25T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191325}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T04:32:26Z","paid_date":"2008-04-25T09:04:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24250,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria E. is 55 years old, a widow with three (3) children and lives in Benin City.

She's 55 years old and didn't have the opportunity to go to school because her parents could not afford it.  She is married and the mother of eight children between 25 and 45 years old, all married.\r\n\r\nMaria left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the frontier with Swaziland, with her husband who was in the service of the civil police.  Once in Namaacha, she started working in Macuacua, a place in the same district.  She decided to raise guinea fowl, as this is an appropriate zone for this activity, and to sell them in town.  With the funds she made, and with the help of her husband, they bought a car, which allowed them to expand their business even further.  Besides chickens, they also began to sell charcoal in the city of Maputo.  But because of the war, Maria lost all her goods and moved to town, where she continues her enterprise, but with a lot of difficulty.  Today she raises chickens at home.  She has bought at most 2 x 100 cases of chicks at 14000 meticais and resold each at 85 meticais.  She has had a profit of 3000 meticais monthly and manages to save 1000 per month, because she has to pay the expenses of her grandchildren, who are in school.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second of Maria's loans with Hluvuku, and the first with Kiva.  The first, of 8000 meticais, she used to buy chicks.  She was able to repay it without a single difficulty and now is applying for this second one of 10000 meticais to strengthen her business.  She's confident that she will repay ahead of time and request another loan to renovate her stall.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

\n","en":"Mahkamboy A. is a 24-year-old guy who works with his mother (pictured) selling dried fruit, peanuts, almonds, and pistachios.

Es as\u00ed que vende art\u00edculos por temporada, como ropa, comida, postres, etc., actualmente se encuentra ofreciendo turrones, ya que en el mes de octubre se acostumbra realizar la procesi\u00f3n de la imagen de \u201cEl Se\u00f1or de los Milagros\u201d, evento religioso muy t\u00edpico peruano y este postre es tradicional en esta fecha, por lo que tambi\u00e9n es muy rentable. Es por ello que Edith quiere aumentar su mercader\u00eda para poder ofrecerla a sus familiares, amigos y vecinos de la zona en la que vive, la cual por ser alejada y de dif\u00edcil acceso es muy propicia para el negocio, pues todos prefieren comprar algo que tienen cerca a viajar una hora o m\u00e1s para adquirir estos productos.\nEs el quinto pr\u00e9stamo de Edith con Microfinanzas PRISMA, donde considera que el trabajo con su grupo es muy bueno, pues todas son muy buenas amigas y muy responsables tambi\u00e9n. Con el dinero que solicita comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de turrones para comercializarlos en esta temporada.","en":"Edith is a happy 33 year-old woman who lives with her 40 year-old husband, Fernando, and her 13 year-old son, Daniel.  She has worked independently the past few years to generate extra income to support her husband's salary.  She sells different items each season, such as clothes, food, cake, etc.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, she is selling nougat candies since it is a traditional sweet for the procession of \"The Man of Miracles,\" a typical Peruvian religious event that takes place every October, and is very profitable. Edith wants to increase her merchandise so she can offer it to family members, friends, and neighbors in her area.  Because the area where they live is remote and hard to get to it is favorable to her business, since otherwise her customers would have to travel an hour or more to buy similar products.\r\n\r\nThis is Edith's fifth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA. She thinks their work is very good since all the members are both good friends and responsible. She will use the loan to buy a larger amount of nougat candy to sell this season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":403493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying candy to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T10:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":283},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":285}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":99.88,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":288.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997646},{"amount":99.88,"local_amount":283,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":288.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842998},{"amount":299.65,"local_amount":849,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":864.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734574},{"amount":100.59,"local_amount":285,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":290.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992510}],"funded_date":"2009-10-19T21:59:27Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":147260,"name":"Sina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sina S. is a 39-year-old woman living in the town of Fasitoo Uta.

Gulsara is 49 years old. She and her husband have raised 5 children. For 15 years already, Gulsara has been working in the local market of the city. She sells rice, green grams, buckwheat, and peas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is the way he manages to support his family with the peace of mind that they lack for nothing at home.  His constant motivation to excel led him to enter this business and he has made himself very well-known over time because he sells the freshest and most delicious fish at the market.  He is a pleasant salesman who always greets his customers with a smile. \r\n\r\nHe also rents a vehicle, which provides him with additional income.  At first it was very complicated for him, but in time he became more capable.  \r\n\r\nWhat he likes the most about his work is talking with his customers.  He has been doing this business activity for four years.  He considers the most difficult part to be putting up with the intense smell of the fish because it permeates his clothes.  He hopes in the future to have a vehicle that is set up to allow him to transport his products without the bad odor.  \r\n\r\nThis will be his third loan with MFP.  He is very happy to know that he will have financial support.  That way he will feel certain that his business will advance.  He pledges, once again, to make his payments on time as he did with the previous loans that he had.  He will use the requested 2,000 soles to buy more products in order to keep selling.

is married and has a one year old son. He used to work in a factory, but they let him go four years ago. Since money was tight and he had mouths to feed, Juan opened up his own business, which has become a local favorite in Guayaquil. In fact, whenever the Mifex team visits Ecuador, Juan (or \u201cNene\u201d as he likes to be called) serves up the best dishes around.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He and his wife work seven days a week managing their restaurant which sells rice & beans, beef, chicken, and chorizo. His wife Betty is the cook, and Nene attends to the clients. It wasn\u2019t easy to start the restaurant because they didn\u2019t have much capital. However, like many other Ecuadorian businesses, they started out by working from home in order to save money. Through perseverance, things have gone pretty well over the past four years. They have received such high demand that they had to build an extension to their home just to make space for more tables. Not only are customers coming from the local neighborhood, but from all around Guayaquil. Nene and Betty run the restaurant from 6:30 pm until 2:00 am.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan and Betty have made great progress with their business over the last several months with the help of a Mifex loan. The chairs and tables they bought were good investments as they allowed their customers to be more comfortable. They also used part of their money to buy meats in bulk.

She is married and has a child who is 25. Since 2002, Amina has been earning income running a mama lishe, a local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania that serves food such as ugali (hot, sticky dough made from maize flour) and plantains (cooked savoury banana), served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces.\r\nAmina works 9 to 12 hours a day. Currently, she needs a loan of US$250 in order to purchase additional supplies for her restaurant, including mchele (uncooked rice) and maharage (beans). Amina thanks everyone for their support.\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of ingredients for a restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T16:30:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970731},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886948},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436208},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130481},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027283},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613306},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010389},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232700},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35413.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664516}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T18:19:10Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77537,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Mom N., 44, and her husband, Mr. Savat Miech, 46, who live about seventeen kilometers from Phnom Penh, were married in 1983 and have three sons.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and an outpost of Alexander the Great's domain. From this region sprang great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex amalgam of Islamic, Soviet, and modern Western influences as well as Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan's independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Matluba is a 30-year-old woman, who is married and has two children.  Her husband has gone to Russia to find work.  Matluba does not work outside the home as her children are still little, so for the past three years she has run a business trading out of a small shop near the house. She lives on the outskirts of the city of Khujand in micro-district 13, and retail outlets there are scarce. Matluba's customers are her neighbors, and her shop stocks staples for the home. Once she has received the loan, she would like to start selling ice cream.  There's a small space in front of her shop that Matluba has remodeled and where she has installed an awning, so that in the summertime she can put out plastic tables and chairs to serve her customers ice cream and beverages.  She decided to take out a small loan to get started, and in the future will obtain financing to carry out her plans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":313488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Sale of groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matluba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994542},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215787},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645275},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084856},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001050},{"amount":20.85,"local_amount":66.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":82.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846272}],"funded_date":"2009-05-13T22:30:14Z","paid_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":110305,"name":"Rubina Asif Masih Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rubina baji has lived in the city of Borewala, Pakistan for the past 14 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Ocidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  selling coconut candy and a pig fattening business. She has 9 children who are 20 to 40 years old with 6 of her children having their own family while her other 3 children are working and helping out with some of the family needs.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elizabeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she could continue to save up for future house repairs and the family's needs. Elizabeth G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

everyday. About six years ago, she decided to start raising and selling animals. This allows her to pay for the education of her three children, who have high hopes for the future. She raises young cattle and later sells them at the markets. She prepares them to be ready to eat for the eating pleasure of the people in her country. Since Onabibi aspires for a great future, she decided to expand her businesses with the sole purpose of improving her family's living conditions and to help pay for her children's education so that they can one day become good citizens in society. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International: Tajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her dedication to farming is surprising: very early every day, she cares for her crops of corn, potatoes and artichokes.

Her artichokes are well sought-after in the market, since this is one of the foods that is exported to other countries.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nPerla is married and has 3 adult-aged children. To make a living, Perla owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Perla has been engaged in her business for years and earns approximately 80,000 PHP per crop for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Perla joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perla is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase some hogs to raise. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Perla from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In particular, everyone loves her gluten-free Brazilian cheese bread (\u201cpao de quijo\u201d), which she learned to make as a high school exchange student in Brazil.  After years of urging from friends and family, Jewelie finally decided to start a business to sell her famous bread.  To build a strong foundation for the new enterprise, Jewelie enrolled in a six-week business planning program at Mercy Corps Northwest in Portland, Oregon.\r\n\r\nAs laid out in the business plan that she developed with the help of her Mercy Corps trainer, Jewelie plans to sell the bread frozen to both wholesale and retail customers. In the meantime, she has been diligently building her network and generating buzz around the product. With a commercial lease, licenses, and a strong network in place, Jewelie now needs funds to purchase equipment (e.g., mixer, freezers, etc.), packaging, and a computer. Because its loan fund was fully deployed, Mercy Corps referred Jewelie to ACCION USA, where she was approved for a $9,000 loan. \r\n\r\nWe at ACCION USA look forward to watching her business grow (not to mention to sample her bread!).\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Information About This Loan\r\nKiva realizes that access to credit is a challenge for entrepreneurs everywhere. Kiva started out as a website focused on developing-world entrepreneurs. In June 2009, Kiva began experimenting with allowing entrepreneurs in the United States to raise money on its website.

She would also like to purchase flour and bread with this loan so as to diversify her production and to attract more customers. This will allow her to respond to the needs of her family and to improve their quality of life. <p>Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Massah E. est ag\u00e9e de 41 ans, mari\u00e9e de 5 enfants.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thanks to the work of her husband, they have a house to live and settle in. When she married, she began to worry about their finances, since their needs grew, and her partner couldn\u2019t afford the costs that their children demanded. For this reason she began to work as a traveling salesperson. Three years ago, she began to sell clothes and kitchen utensils from door to door to obtain necessary experience. Since one year ago, she began to work in orders at the end of every month, and she only sold in the streets on weekends at the markets. Now, thanks to the support of her partner, she is finishing the construction of her home where she hopes to invest various years of savings to install a grocery store. This is her first loan with MFP. It is opening the doors to progress and establishing new relationships with the women in her community bank.

They have two lively sons: Wilder, who is 8, and Abel, who is 4. They all live in a cozy house, which they own, located in a quiet town in the Peruvian mountains.\r\n\r\nEvery morning Mery begins her day at dawn, because she has many jobs to do during the day. She begins by taking care of her little ones, so that they can get to school on time. Later she needs to cook so that when her sons come home they will have good food to eat. After that she heads to her fields, where she grows potatoes. She does all this alone, as her husband works as a shepherd all day long. Although the work she does is very tiring, she does it with no problems because she is always thinking of her children\u2019s future and doesn\u2019t want them to lack for anything. She wants them to study and eventually pursue their own careers.\r\n\r\nShe knows that she can achieve whatever she puts her mind to, and for this reason she works tirelessly in the cultivation of her lands.

She is sure that she will be as responsible as always, and on time with payments, because she knows that this is the only way to achieve what she has planned in life, With the money she is asking for, she plans to buy bags of manure and fertilizers in order to take good care of her lands in case any problems might arise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":453348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of manure and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T02:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1224,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672752}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T04:09:38Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Searle lives in this region. She is an enterprising woman and a mother of two children, aged 18 and 20. She started out sewing clothes more than 15 years ago with one sewing machine, after having been employed in a tailor's shop. Initially her client base was her own family, her friend, and her nearest neighbors. She worked hard to make high quality clothes and to have her projects completed on time. She wishes to keep her clients and that has been a measure of her success. She has made her business grow and now she is well known by companies and shops, some of which she has established contract agreements. \r\n\r\nSearle has accessed 22 past loans from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner), an organization that has support her for the past 14 years. During that time she has strengthened her working capital funds and she has managed to have her own home where to live. Currently she requests a new loan to purchase fabrics and other materials to fill a contract to make school uniforms, a contract with a provincial institution. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to set up a stand from where to sell products such as threads, zippers, lining and decorations. She wishes to expand her client base and to this end she wants to start this new business. It will also help in supporting the growth of her tailoring shop.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":606507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fabrics and other materials to make school uniforms.

She is 34 years old and lives in Tenextepango, in Ciudad Ayala, in the State of Morelos, in Mexico.  Emilia studied for two years at university.  She is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad mainly to buy supplies for her business such as flour, turkey, cold meats, chilis, ham, sausages, almonds, nuts and pineapple.\r\n\r\nEmilia has a bakery business in her neighborhood where she sells: sweet bread, 'teleras' (Mexican flat bread), bread rolls, white bread, etc.  She has been in her business for a year.  She learned to make bread because her dad taught her when she was a young girl.  She later taught her husband to make bread and he now makes the bread and she sells it.  This business has helped her with all her expenses, in paying for food and in paying for her children's schooling.  She inherited the premises where her business is located from her dad and although her business is well established, she also goes out to sell her products in Ahuehueyo, in the market.  It is 5 minutes from her home.  She travels there in a truck.  Emilia's business is important because it is how she supports her family.  She tells us that she likes making bread and that the work is very satisfying, for example when people tell her that her bread is very tasty.  She says that she serves on average 50 - 80 people a day.  She offers her customers baked turkeys and legs of meat at Christmas and New Year.  Some of the challenges that she has faced in her business have been the rise in prices for her raw materials such as sugar and flour and also the rise in competition.\r\n\r\nEmilia generally re-invests her profits in her business which makes more profits.  In the future, she is planning to expand her business, setting up another bakery.\r\n\r\nEmilia is married and has two children: 8 year-old \u00c1mbar who is in elementary school and 2 year-old Yael.  Her husband helps her make her bread and she is proud to be following her dad's tradition as he was a baker.  She is planning to grow her business in the future and she would like to set up another bakery.  This will make her more income and she will be able to get her children ahead in their studies.  Emilia would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"thank you for the loan but I expected that you would lend me a larger loan amount\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":680360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy flour, sugar, eggs, salt, turkeys, cold meats, ham, sausages, almonds, nuts, pineapple and cherries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TENEXTEPANGO, CD AYALA, MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430786},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850045},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292318},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160583},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":618.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233491}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T07:52:47Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":266886,"name":"Mi Banquito Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LA Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cMi banquito\u201d es un grupo conformado por 8 personas que residen en una zona rural, son arduos trabajadores, cada uno dedicado a distintas actividades.

Adela regional office.  This group has 14 members and its president is Luisa.  The businesses that the bank's members are engaged in are varied and include: setting up a hairdressing salon, selling lamb, knitting blankets, macram\u00e9 and blankets, sewing, selling footwear, sewing jackets, weaving with satin cord, selling wool, selling beef and selling medicines.\r\n\r\nLuisa, the bank's president, tells us that this is the first time she has worked with Pro Mujer.  She was invited to join by the institution's young promoters.\r\n\r\nLuisa currently has a business selling Tiens-brand medicines.  She tells us that she learned the business from a friend who is teaching her to work with these medicinal products.  Luisa will use her loan to buy medicines from the Tiens office in El Alto.  She will then sell them as an itinerant street vendor because she doesn't have a fixed sales location.\r\n\r\nThis work allows Luisa to make money to support her family.  She is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked Luisa what she likes about Pro Mujer she replied that she likes the training and the services.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, we can see that three people are missing: Ana, Maxima and Silvia.  This is because they couldn't fit in properly.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":743482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy Tiens-brand medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-04-03T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Corina Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Exacta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita  Concepci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21717.15,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2171.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":312.51,"local_amount":2171.77,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206221332},{"amount":625.01,"local_amount":4343.54,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4350.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211296498},{"amount":625.02,"local_amount":4343.54,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:50:20Z","rounded_local_amount":4350.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216576396},{"amount":625.02,"local_amount":4343.54,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4350.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746115},{"amount":937.44,"local_amount":6514.76,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":6524.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115739}],"funded_date":"2011-04-04T11:51:47Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:16:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":291476,"name":"Norberta Veronica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Norberta Veronica es una mujer muy trabajadora, desde hace varios a\u00f1os tuvo que quedarse sola ya que  su esposo tuvo que emigrar a los Estados Unidos para traer mayores ingresos a su familia.

She\u2019s married to Jorge, 52, and they have two children who are 16 and 9 years old.  They share their days and the joy of educating their daughters.  They live in their own house where she works hard to provide a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nZoila works in a very busy sector.  She has a very good business that provides many possibilities.  Her business operates in her home.  She has a food stand where she sells her delicious meals.  The aroma from her delicious stews is enough to attract customers.  Her stand is very popular and in general she sells much during the night.  She\u2019s been in this business for 32 years and it\u2019s given her money to feed her daughters and pay for their schooling.  But, she feels that later on she\u2019ll have more expenses and money will be insufficient.  This is why she wants to open a restaurant to sell her delicious dishes more comfortably and thus improve her income.  She\u2019s improved quite a bit since she started and she knows that by working it\u2019s possible to gradually reach great things.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys chatting with her customers; she enjoys it very much but it\u2019s difficult to tend to all the people who come to her stand but even so she does not falter in her eagerness to get ahead and is willing to work hard to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 8th MFP loan so she\u2019s hoping for your collaboration to continue with her objectives; she commits once again to make her installment payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans.  It pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all its members are responsible and very supportive people.  She will use the requested 3000 soles to buy ingredients to continue making her delicious meals and will also buy some kitchen utensils she needs to be able to continue with her work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":953973,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy food preparation ingredients and kitchen utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-21T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zoila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":453.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":478.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":476.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":513.79},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":532.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":545.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":349.26,"local_amount":931.37,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":941.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246145},{"amount":178.64,"local_amount":476.36,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":481.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386161},{"amount":192.67,"local_amount":513.79,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":519.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099255},{"amount":199.86,"local_amount":532.96,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":538.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713402},{"amount":204.57,"local_amount":545.52,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":551.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202291}],"funded_date":"2012-01-01T04:41:22Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":377562,"name":"Pasikazia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pasikazia is 56 years old, a widow with one child who lives in Kasese, Uganda.

She lives together with her children in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is known for maize farming. Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income through selling harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. Availability of labour is a major challenge for Rosemary. She also keeps a dairy cow. Before joining Juhudi, Rosemary could not access loans from banks since she is a woman and also a smallholder farmer. She joined Juhudi Kilimo and learnt about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about Kiva. Rosemary is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. With your loan, Rosemary will make her farm activities much easier.

This is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Seven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":223072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cosmetics and resell them to different customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027594},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613595},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010674},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232960},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664751},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105471},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022616},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867865},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757066},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146178}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T01:30:28Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Sutcliffe","image":null}},{"id":98065,"name":"Kodjo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Monsieur A.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Leaa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leaa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.    Leaa is now requesting a loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Leaa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

K\u1ef7 is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02-Ho\u1eb1ng Tr\u01b0\u1eddng 2-Ho\u1eb1ng H\u00f3a  (40102).\r\n\r\nK\u1ef7 is married and has 4 adult children.  To making a living, K\u1ef7 operates a family member's business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting & selling wild-caught fish in the local community.  K\u1ef7 has been engaged in this business for over 30 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, K\u1ef7 joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  K\u1ef7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  This will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  K\u1ef7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

He has been building his house little by little and currently wishes to build a bedroom so that when his children grow they will have a bit more privacy.

With 45,000KGS in initial capital, he managed to turn his farm into a successful establishment with two horses, fifteen sheep, five goats, and a cow. Thanks to profits from managing the business, Karagul was able to help his children get their own houses. Nowadays, Karagul has income from selling milk and meat products on the order of 15,000KGS per month. \r\n\r\nKaragul has come to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 40,000KGS to buy two calves so he can increase his earnings, which he plans to use to do repairs on his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":872091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chet -

She is 38 years old and has one son.  She has been a client with IMPRO since 1998 and made money with the first loan that IMPRO lent her for her cosmetics business. Currently, she is active in selling clothes like trousers, sweaters and polo shirts.  She has found a good market for them, which allows her to have steady and sufficient income for all her needs.  The loan she seeks now is to buy more merchandise in larger quantities. That is, by dozens so that it is cheaper and her margins are greater than when she buys merchandise for less (be it by units instead of dozens).  Her payment history with IMPRO qualifies her as a \u201cpreferred client\u201d as all her previous loans have been paid off in total in installed payments stipulated in each contract.

With the consecutive loans he received from Majmoua, he expanded his business and improved the living conditions and quality of life of his family.
