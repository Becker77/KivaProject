Juana is a single woman principally working on her farm, land that she was able to get with great sacrifice over these last 25 years.  Now, thanks to the work that she does, she has her own land with coffee plants that are very productive.  Juana says that she also has problems in the rainy season since that is when destructive insects appear that hurt her crops, and she doesn't have the financial capacity to resolve these issues.  That is why she is asking for the loan that MFP offers to help with her business plans.  This will be her first loan with MFP, and she feels grateful for the trust given her.  She also thanks the communal bank for letting her work with them.  She will use the 1500 new sols to buy chemical products so that she can get rid of the infestation that hurts her cacao plants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1002480,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chemical products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T00:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":124.76},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":136.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":136.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":142.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":146.23},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":152.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":156.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":163.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":169.21},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":173.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.15},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.47},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.66},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.86},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.82,"local_amount":124.76,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":128.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386499},{"amount":52.15,"local_amount":136.03,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":140.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099608},{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":136.06,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":140.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713747},{"amount":54.56,"local_amount":142.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:08Z","rounded_local_amount":146.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202640},{"amount":56.06,"local_amount":146.23,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098323},{"amount":58.47,"local_amount":152.53,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":157.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401107},{"amount":59.92,"local_amount":156.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":161.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455565},{"amount":62.66,"local_amount":163.44,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":168.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451332},{"amount":64.86,"local_amount":169.21,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":174.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446516},{"amount":66.34,"local_amount":173.06,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":178.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052530}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T10:56:15Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":392453,"name":"Oulimata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Oulimata est une commer\u00e7ante qui vendait des v\u00eatements.Elle a arr\u00eat\u00e9 cette activit\u00e9 pour mieux superviser les travaux de construction de sa maison.Elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants dont les 2 sont des \u00e9l\u00e8ves.

Norma lives with her family in a home in the district and province of  Chanchamayo. Norma is a woman who likes field work. At 20 she learned to be independent, and with the help of her husband was able to grow and produce fruit in 3 blocks or parcels of land.\r\n\r\nThus, she grows coffee, bananas and avocados. Coffee is her flagship product, which gets more revenue, but it's an annual crop. Bananas give security to solve her need for high revenue each week. But avocados may be what some tastes prefer. \"Every time I harvest, I sell 10 to 12 crates, each selling for 12 soles,\" she says. Meanwhile, Julio works at a private company which generates a fixed monthly income. He feels happy to work, because thanks to his effort he can support and educate their children. One of Norma's short term goals is to acquire another plot of land to expand her production of coffee. \r\n\r\nThis would be the first time that Norma would agree to a loan from MFP.

This doesn't affect him much as he also has 7 dairy cows which provide him with 70 liters of fresh milk which he sells to a middleman who then sells it to the factories.  In this way, he is able to make more profits.  F\u00e9lix would like to open a stable business so that he can live peacefully together with his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nF\u00e9lix is a member of the \"Chamblachaca\" community bank and this is his 18th loan from MFP.

She has two children, ages 18 and 9.  Martha and her family live in their own house in the community of Puente Kimiri, in the district of Chanchamayo.  Martha, a woman with a winning temper, has worked in agriculture for 20 years, since she joined her life to her husband.  Now she has experience in her job, so she grows pineapples on six \"cuadras\" [a \"cuadra\" is approximately 1.5 acres] and bananas on one.  The pineapples are a profitable business and her harvests are annual.\r\n\r\nCurrently she plans to grow coffee, so she needs to make the effort in the hard work that is pruning, irrigating, growing, weeding, and harvesting the coffee.  She also works as administrative staff in an educational institution, but admits that the farming is what she most likes to do.  With the help of her oldest son she is able to speed up her work and save on paying personnel, but when the work is more intense, for example during the harvest, she has to hire workers.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her new coffee crop will be successful.  She will fight for this, as is proper.  This would be the first time that Martha would get a loan from MFP.  This is why she promises to be punctual in making her monthly payments.  Virgen del Carmen is the name of her recent communal bank.  She feels enthusiastic about being part of it.\r\n\r\nShe will invest the money to buy 1000 coffee plants, each one of which costs 20 Peruvian cents.  With this she will begin her planting of two \"cuadras.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003729,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy one thousand coffee plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T02:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T02:40:15Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":117.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":126.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":137.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":141.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":169.16},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":179.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":186.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.71},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.19},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.21},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.85},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.88,"local_amount":117.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":120.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386519},{"amount":48.35,"local_amount":126.13,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":129.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099638},{"amount":49.12,"local_amount":128.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-17T08:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":131.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713777},{"amount":52.71,"local_amount":137.52,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":141.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202669},{"amount":54.19,"local_amount":141.37,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":145.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098350},{"amount":59.21,"local_amount":154.45,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":159.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401131},{"amount":61.35,"local_amount":160.05,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":164.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455571},{"amount":64.85,"local_amount":169.16,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":174.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451342},{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":179.47,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":184.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315446521},{"amount":71.55,"local_amount":186.64,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:29Z","rounded_local_amount":192.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323052534}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T17:38:38Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T15:23:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":392332,"name":"Phares","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phares is 60 years old.

She sold a few things or clothing to family members, but now she sells to friends and neighbors.  She works alone.  Every day she goes out to sell from 3 in the afternoon until 7 in the evening.

She lives in a traditional family in Missira, in S\u00e9gou  town. As she did not go to school, she started as a retailer at a very young age, selling \"pagnes\" (African cloth) with her sister, who sold shoes and clothes. After learning the business from her sister for several years, Fatoumata began selling on her own. In addition to this business which she has had for 15 years and benefits from a lot of experience, she diversified her business by starting to buy and sell fish. Fish is highly prized in malian cooking and very well-liked. \n\nIn order to meet customer demand and to increase profits, Fatoumata is asking for a new loan. She has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for 24 months, with two fully repaid individual loans. This is her third individual loan which will be used to buy 1000 kg of fish powder.

Pepe and his family live together in their own home, in the indigenous community of Palomar, in R\u00edo Negro district, in Satipo province.  Since he was a young boy, Pepe has been surrounded by coffee plantations and other plants growing on his parents' farmland.  Now he farms himself and, with great skill, he grows coffee, cacao, bananas and corn.  He has three 'cuadras' (measurement of agricultural land) on which he sows his crops.\r\n\r\nPepe enjoys what he does as farm work is less restricting and he makes income according to how he manages his business and how well he negotiates the sale of his crops.  He has to transport his produce to the city of Pichanaki where he is already well known for his good produce and for the number of years he has been in the business.  What he sells the most of is cacao and coffee.  The prices for these products almost always remain stable and if they do fall it isn't by much.

She has developed her work in sewing over the last four years. This is a business that she chose out of passion.

Additionally he works in agriculture, for which he depends on one plot of farmland where he has sown corn and rice. The two of them have planned to grow both incomes because they want to improve their living conditions for themselves and for their sons and feed them well and give them the education they deserve.\r\n\r\nJuan has decided to request a loan of 1200 Nuevos Soles through Edpyme Alternativa, since the products he has currently sown need to be fertilized. So he needs to buy fertilizer to improve his production, and at the same time he needs to buy balanced feed for the animals his wife is raising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":1003914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy balanced feed and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

the help of credits.  She previously sold children's shoes and changed her focus since then.  Because women's scarves are in high demand here, she decided to sell scarves and shawls for women.  As Mavluda says, her sales improved, and she started to earn a good income.  She travels for merchandise to Istaravshan twice per month.  Her husband is an electrician, and his income is quite sufficient for living, and they spend Mavluda's income on unexpected family expenses.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJennifer operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJennifer hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1006716,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T18:03:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T18:03:14Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275534},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.01,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997957},{"amount":53.34,"local_amount":2134,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2275.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606496},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:11:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095357}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T18:40:27Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T12:11:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":391087,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carmen de 47 a\u00f1os es una madre soltera de 4 hijos, pero solo vive con 2.

Together with her husband, she manages their  household while operating their business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria Nena operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, some cooking oil, or an egg. Maria Nena earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells directly for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Maria Nena is requesting a loan for 14,000 PHP, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Nena hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the study of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is married to Romeo, a mechanic and father to her children. Together with her husband, Helen manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 24,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHelen hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMaria Corazon operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMaria Corazon hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week; there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1006741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and other products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Corazon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2274.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275540},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.97,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2844.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997960},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606499},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:59:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1706.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283095360}],"funded_date":"2012-02-16T22:01:15Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T11:59:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy Martin","image":null}},{"id":393016,"name":"Mamadou Gu\u00e9ye","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mamadou est un \u00e9lectricien qui exerce ce m\u00e9tier depuis 2005.Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 auparavant apprenti dans un grand atelier dans sa localit\u00e9.Aujourd'hui, il gagne des marchand d'installation de r\u00e9seau \u00e9lectriques dans des b\u00e2timents en construction.

","en":"Matluba is a woman, who is involved in sewing dresses.  She sews to-order for her friends.  Matluba has two adult sons, who work as plasterers, and her husband is disabled and stays home.

He currently lives together with them and his wife in a house located in a rural district, where the primary commercial activity is farming and raising livestock.  The village where he lives is located just a few minutes from the district of Tambogrande, which belongs to the province of Piura.  Because it is a rural area, they currently only have the public service of electricity.\r\n\r\nFrom a young age, Luis has dedicated himself to working the land, a task he used to carry out at his parents\u2019 side.  This same farming experience led to, after the passing of years, him being able to have his own farmland; he has obtained 1.70 hectares where he has planted lemons and passion fruit.  His wife managed to finish a degree in education, a profession that she now fulfills in the town where they live, helping Luis with the family\u2019s needs.  They have a very good relationship, and work together to meet their goals.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Luis\u2019 fruit plants are in a phase where they need fertilizers is the reason he has decided to request a loan through Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 Peruvian soles.  He will invest these funds into the purchase of these, which will help him improve production and sell his crops at better prices.\r\n\r\nThe projects that Luis and his wife have laid out are being carried out in an opportune and efficient way.  The trait that characterizes them both best is their responsible nature.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1004086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase fertilizers for his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-16T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-17T21:10:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Edgardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":141.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":142.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":148.65},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":161.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":175.4},{"due_date":"2012-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":179.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":185.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":191.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":195.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.38},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.77},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.22},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.93},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.23,"local_amount":141.95,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":142.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012138},{"amount":53.38,"local_amount":142.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":143.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621256},{"amount":55.84,"local_amount":148.9,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":149.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332625},{"amount":55.74,"local_amount":148.65,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:29Z","rounded_local_amount":149.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423416},{"amount":60.6,"local_amount":161.6,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":162.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316814},{"amount":123.39,"local_amount":329.05,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":331.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301373658},{"amount":65.78,"local_amount":175.4,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":176.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315368521},{"amount":67.22,"local_amount":179.25,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":180.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322977599},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":185.2,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":186.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331114847},{"amount":71.93,"local_amount":191.8,"processed_date":"2013-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":192.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339506528},{"amount":73.44,"local_amount":195.85,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":197.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347058503}],"funded_date":"2012-03-05T22:26:08Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T12:28:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":392689,"name":"Gagik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gagik is 50 years old and lives in the village of Zovaber in Sevan with his wife and only son.

his wife and five children. He is a farmer and has raised seasonal fruits and vegetables for the last 8 years. During these years Avaz gained enough skills and experience to run the business. He chose this crop business because it is profitable and fresh fruits and vegetables are in high demand. \n\nPeople use fresh vegetables everyday and consider them healthy. Many national dishes like pilau and dolma are made of vegetables. Fresh fruits are served on every table of Azerbaijan families and they also make fresh punch. He usually sells his crop in the central bazaar. His monthly income is 260 AZN.\n\nAs these products are in high demand, Avaz wants to expand his business and produce more fruits and vegetables to cover market demand. For this purpose, he applied for 1,000 AZN. He will buy new garden tools, seeds and fertilizers.\n\n\n*An internally displaced person (IDP) is someone who has been forced to flee his or her home due to armed conflict, violence, human rights violations, or natural or manmade disasters, but who, unlike a refugee, has not crossed an international border (source: UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian

years old and a mother who is very responsible and hard working.  She has 4 children, of whom only one is dependent on her; the rest work on their own.  She lives with her husband in a rural area of Olmos named \u201cFiloque Grande\u201d, which is only a few minutes from the district of Olmos and approximately 2 hours from the city of Lambayeque.\r\n\r\nBecause Clara is a hard-working woman who fights to meet her goals, over time, she has managed to save money she obtained from her previous work in farming.  She bought two moto taxis with the money she saved, and now rents them out to transport passengers from town to town.  This work generates her income on a daily basis and she projects that, over time, she will purchase two more vehicles, which is something she is already working towards.\r\n\r\nHer husband, like her, is committed to the goal of succeeding, which is why he works independently as a master builder throughout the zone where they live.

It is a small factory where she makes and sells snacks.  She works every day from 6 in the morning making snacks with the help of two other people who she pays a weekly salary and later with the help of her grandson.

He feels his business is sufficiently profitable because of the demand for transportation in the city and because he earns a good income. Consequently he plans to expand his business and hopes to buy another motor taxi and thus generate more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP and he hopes for your collaboration so that he can continue to meet his goals. With the 1,000 nuevos soles requested, he will buy spare parts for maintenance of his motor taxi and pay for the services of a mechanic.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":1004237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase spare parts and pay a mechanic.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T01:10:04Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debner ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":147.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":160.12},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":159.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":172.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":178.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":182.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.44,"local_amount":147.83,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":148.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386529},{"amount":60.04,"local_amount":160.12,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":161.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099652},{"amount":59.82,"local_amount":159.51,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":160.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713791},{"amount":64.51,"local_amount":172.04,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":173.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202683},{"amount":66.93,"local_amount":178.46,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":179.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098364},{"amount":68.26,"local_amount":182.04,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":183.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401145}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T02:11:41Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":392704,"name":"Sabina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabina is a 43-year-old lady from Migori town.

The union of Jose and his wife has meant that they have defined some new goals for their family, and it is for this reason that they both work each day in order to achieve them and in this way improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nJose, with clear and established goals, wants to buy animal feed to fatten his animals, and he also wants to buy more animals with the objective of increasing his sales.  Jose has requested a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the sum of 1,500 Peruvian soles, which will help him to increase his income so that he can improve his quality of life, and at the same time, pay back the loan he is requesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1004125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock and animal feed   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":104.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":105.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":113.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":118},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":122.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.2},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":131.65},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":135.15},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":138.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":144.3},{"due_date":"2013-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":147.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.76},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.47},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.8},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.32},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":104.95,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":107.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270012142},{"amount":40.39,"local_amount":105.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":108.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276621260},{"amount":43.39,"local_amount":113.2,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T14:00:08Z","rounded_local_amount":116.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283332629},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":114.15,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":117.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287423420},{"amount":407.23,"local_amount":1062.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294316818}],"funded_date":"2012-02-24T09:19:59Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:20:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":392733,"name":"Estela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Estela, 52, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines.

She lives with her partner, Elar, with whom she has a family business, and who is the father of her children. Together they live in their own house, but every weekend their children who are already adults and independent visit her. Llerme's business activities include the sale of soft drinks and candies. Similarly, she has as a family business an upholstery workshop, where her partner takes charge of the business. Both businesses are located in their house, in this way they save the expense of renting a shop. She has been working in these businesses for more than two years with the help of an assistant in the upholstery shop, who is paid for each job completed. She feels that her business is quite profitable because of the good earnings that it yields. For that reason she has plans to expand her business and enter into others, such as opening a tourist restaurant and doing this on their own land. Thus she will be able to generate more income. This will be her 11th loan with the MFP institution, so she hopes for your assistance to continue with her goals.

All three are studying in high school. Her husband has a cobbling factory and is a bricklayer. \r\n\r\nAngela got a degree in educational science and works as a teacher in a nearby school, but to help her husband she has asked for the loan so he can use it in his business. He will put it towards the creation and sale of pavement (material used for the construction of streets and sidewalks.) He works from Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. making and selling pavement. He sells to individual people as well as to public institutions that need this material. In the afternoons, she helps him more than anything doing sales and accounting for the small business. She works with two people who he pays a weekly salary. He has had this business for more than 10 years and it is going very well for him.\r\n\r\nThis loan is for the purchase of cement, sand, and other materials necessary for the production of pavement. She has been a part of the Communal Bank for more than 7 years and she likes it because of the way the bank works.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that the business will grow more every day.

She lives comfortably in her parents' home with Eli, who works and is the father of her 8-year-old son. She makes a living in transportation with a moto-taxi business. She started with a family loan three years ago and pays it back on a daily basis. In this way she has kept the business growing and now has three moto-taxis. She counts on the support of her partner, who helps administer the vehicles. She likes the business because it generates income and she feels productive supporting Eli with household expenses. On the other hand, she doesn't like it when it rains a lot because it makes the roads difficult and the moto-taxis go slower. She has plans of adding another business, like opening a shop for spare parts. This will be her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she awaits your collaboration so she can solidify her plans. She enjoys being part of her community bank because it is a united group. With the money she is requesting, she plans to invest in the purchase of spare parts like tires, motor oil and other items to maintain her vehicles."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1004248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase tires and motor oil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":221.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":239.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":239.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":257.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":267.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.92,"local_amount":221.53,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":227.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386535},{"amount":91.99,"local_amount":239.98,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":246.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099658},{"amount":91.64,"local_amount":239.06,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":245.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713797},{"amount":98.84,"local_amount":257.84,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":265.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202689},{"amount":102.52,"local_amount":267.45,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":275.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098370},{"amount":105.09,"local_amount":274.14,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":281.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401151}],"funded_date":"2012-02-21T20:11:47Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":392739,"name":"Mt.livingstone Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima, who is in her mid 30s, is married with one small child.

She is a widow and she lives with her 27 year-old son. They live comfortably in their own house that Flor bought with her deceased husband. Flor sells food, especially lunch, to workers at a business near her house. She prepares the food in her home and then brings it to the business at their break hour. She came to win the workers' favor with her good flavors. People recommended her to others and after a time, she had developed regular customers. Flor has been running this business for over ten years and up to this point, her son has been her greatest support. He helps deliver the food once it's prepared and helps bring in new customers.\r\n\r\nFlor likes this business because it generates good income and allows her to have a job and to feel like a productive person. She also comments that thanks to this work, she has been able to support her household after being widowed. She considers her business to be profitable because of the good earnings she's left with. Therefore, Flor plans to continue with her business and to open a restaurant in her house in the future. This will be her 15th loan through MFP. She is hoping for a small loan so that she can meet her objectives. Meanwhile, she comments that she feels pleased with her communal bank because she considers it to be a united and supportive group.\r\n\r\nFlor will invest the requested 2,000 nuevos soles in the purchase of necessary ingredients for preparing her dishes, such as rice, oil, and other ingredients. She hopes to obtain the lowest prices by purchasing in volume. With the other part of the money, she will buy materials to set up a restaurant in her home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":1004250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, oil, and perishable goods, as well as materials to set up a restaurant in her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":295.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":320.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":318.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":343.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":356.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":364.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.8},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.84,"local_amount":295.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":297.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386536},{"amount":120.05,"local_amount":320.14,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":322.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099659},{"amount":119.6,"local_amount":318.93,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:32Z","rounded_local_amount":320.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713798},{"amount":128.99,"local_amount":343.98,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":346.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202690},{"amount":133.8,"local_amount":356.81,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":359,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098371},{"amount":136.72,"local_amount":364.58,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":366.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294401152}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T11:52:43Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:12:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":392320,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is a student applying for a loan to purchase a laptop to assist in his studies at Strathmore University and this is his story: \r\n\r\nI am a 20-year-old Strathmore University student. I come from a family of five including my mother, two sisters and one brother. My mother is the sole provider for the family and works as a housewife. I happen to be the only one in my family fortunate enough to attend university \u2013 the others' dreams for the same were never realized due to financial constraints that terminated their education as early as primary school. \r\n\r\nI am currently a second year student pursuing a Bachelor of Business Information Technology degree. The courses revolve around computers and I depend entirely on the university computer labs to do the IT projects. The projects are really demanding and require constant contact with computers, even during the weekends when it is not possible to utilize the labs as other classes are also held there.\r\n\r\nMy efforts to solicit funds to purchase a laptop have been rendered futile; thus, I have decided to apply for a loan. The laptop will go a long way in assisting my studies, as notes will always be available and I will be able to complete projects on time. My laptop will also be available to church youths for educational movies during the long holidays. It will enable me to leave nothing pending in my academic life and ensure I graduate in the stipulated time. After graduation, I will venture into teaching to disseminate the knowledge and life skills I have gained in life, after which I will pursue a Master's. I would also like very much to be involved in community welfare programs to put a smile in children's lives which might be denied by financial constraints. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1003572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a laptop which will help him with his projects.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.816667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":218,"posted_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-18T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45999.96,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3833.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":191.67,"local_amount":15333.32,"processed_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15831.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270330045},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-07T08:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3097.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294459726},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301513667},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308499089},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T10:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315708513},{"amount":40.83,"local_amount":3266.69,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T10:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3372.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323275447},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":7666.66,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-18T12:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":7915.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331459301},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3833.33,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-05T08:14:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3957.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339632048},{"amount":17.49,"local_amount":1399.97,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-05-09T09:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347359975}],"funded_date":"2012-02-17T17:58:01Z","paid_date":"2013-05-09T09:34:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":392421,"name":"Justus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justus is a student applying for a loan to complete an undergraduate degree at Strathmore University and this is his story:\r\n\r\nI am Justus. I am the first born in a family of seven children, four of whom are in high school and two in primary school. I am currently in the third year of my studies, pursuing a degree course in Hospitality Management at Strathmore University. I have faced a lot of difficulties paying my school fees since I joined Strathmore in 2009. I come from a humble background as my parents are not in any formal employment. My dad is a local welder and my mother is a peasant farmer. I have always depended on donors and well-wishers to pay for my school fees and even to pay for my younger brothers in high school. \r\n\r\nI am a bright student who has always maintained a top position in class. I have a lot of dreams and aspirations to help other bright but needy students access quality education and be the persons they want to be in the future. It is in this regard that I am kindly applying for this loan so as to enable me to complete my degree studies. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would like to thank the Kiva organization for this initiative, which I count as a blessing; more so at this time when I had almost lost hope in my education due to my financial constraints. Strathmore University has always been, and will forever be, the best educational institution due to the codes of conduct that it instills in its students. The institution enables people to develop virtues and be responsible members of society once they leave campus. \r\n\r\nIn particular, studying at Strathmore has enabled me to acquire the moral virtues required of an honest and responsible citizen. This has been made possible through the units that are taught: for example, Principles of Ethics, Theology, Social and Political Philosophy, and Philosophical Anthropology among others. The dress code has also enabled me to act and carry myself in a professional manner at all times. All these qualities and culture are very rare in most public and private universities in Kenya.\r\n\r\nAfter my graduation, I aspire to come up with a small business entrepreneurship, probably in the hotel industry, or get some employment which will not only enable me to pay back my loan, but will also give me an opportunity to help bright and needy students access higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":1006213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

","en":"Ayub has been a client in the organization for nine years. He has three sons, one of whom is currently working in Russia. Ayub managed to expand the family business over the years. Despite his age Ayub still buys the livestock, but it is his son who raises the animals. Every morning Ayub's son takes the cows out to pasture, and in the evening he brings the animals back to the pen and gives them hay and feed. Ayub was interested in livestock fattening from an early age, and that's what he taught his sons. \r\nAyub has nine grandchildren, and he is a lively grandfather. His wife is a homemaker. Together with her daughters-in-law, she produces goat yarn and sends it over to Russia for her son to sell since it is in high demand there.  Ayub would like to take another loan to buy a couple of dairy cows while the market prices for the animals are low.

When cattle prices rise, he sells the animals and makes the profit. Abdukayum's brothers told him that it is possible to receive a loan to buy the cattle, so he decided to try to get a loan to expand his business. Abdukayum is planning on buying three young bulls.

They have used these loans to improve their financial situation.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Sonia.  She is 40 years old, married, and has three children who are 16, 13 and 4 years old.  Her two oldest children are in high school.  Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nSonia and her husband both farm.  During the winter season they grow corn, peanuts and certain vegetables.  They also grow passion fruit year round as these are  long-cycle crops.  Right now they are focusing on their corn and peanut crops as they require the most protection from pests.  They have requested this loan to buy insecticides and fertilizers so that they can enjoy a better production.  They work from Monday to Friday, from 7.00am to 3.00pm.  In the summer they focus more on producing passion fruit which they pick and then deliver to different markets in the city.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy fertilizers and insecticides.  Sonia has been a member of her community bank from the beginning and she likes it because of the help that they have given her to make progress through loans.\r\n\r\nSonia's dream is to enjoy a very good production and, above all, good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5350,"image":{"id":1004275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Uganda. She is single and has one child. For the past five years, Florence has been working hard to manage her small business, which involves stone quarrying. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 400,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to hire workers and buy some materials to use in her stone quarrying business. This will help Florence generate greater profits and enable her to buy food for her family. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to own a retail shop. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to micro-finance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Florence's future prospects by helping her improve her business.
