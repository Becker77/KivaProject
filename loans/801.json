She is married to Celestino, a steel man, and is a mother to her child. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nJacinta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJacinta hopes her business grows more in the coming year and dreams of being able to give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

Her life centers around the care of her fields as that is where she spends the greater part of the day.  Her primary crops are different varieties of potatoes.  She is known for her charisma in marketing. She sells her products at the central market in the city of Tarma, thanks to her good disposition while making sales.\r\n\r\nOne of her main problems is the \u201crancha\u201d (a type of fungus) that affects her crops.  There are also other diseases, but these do not discourage her.  Later she wants to buy her own fields for farming.  This would minimize her costs.\r\n\r\nHer children are her priority, and the greater part of her income is for their education.  Thanks to the support of her communal bank, she can not only take on her projects, but she can also give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis time she will plant 40 sacks of potato seeds.

Coffee is also one of Sergio's priorities.\r\n\r\nSergio managed to save a certain amount of his income for future projects.  This enabled him to support and educate his older children who now have their own families and are working.  Sergio instilled many values in them, above all solidarity.

They are both farmers.  They raise agricultural products on land he inherited from his father in the community of Chullpani Chico.  In this way, they support their children and send them to get a good education.  Gumercindo at the moment is not working because he needs money to buy new tires for his truck.  This is why they have come to our offices of Cidre to ask for a loan.  He tells us that sometimes the savings that he has is not enough to support the household expenses.  Other financial institutions would not lend him money because of his age.\r\nFinally Gumercindo and his wife feel happy.  They will buy the tires and they will begin to travel as soon as possible.  Their dream is to have their children be professionals and have a better future than what they have had.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":1005199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

They live in the town of Soledad and this is where Harold sells food products and groceries.  He buys these products to supply stores and small businesses who mainly sell to housewives.  Harold started this business three years ago when he started selling toiletries.  His business gradually started to grow and he has now added household essentials such as rice, oil, cold cuts, canned food, etc. to his sales.  Harold sells on a short-term credit system.  He delivers his merchandise to his customers and collects payment the next day.  He makes his purchases for cash every day in grocery stores in the city of Barranquilla, which is 20 minutes from his town.  Each time his customer base grows, he realizes that his working capital is not enough to respond to his demand in a timely manner.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan (his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo).  He will use his loan to buy food products and groceries in larger quantities.  This means he will be able to make the most of bulk discounts and make more profits.  This will have a positive impact on his business and increase his income which he uses to support his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":1002329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

They are blessed with three children. They are Alberto, 25, who graduated from Junior High School; Margareta, 20, who is married; and Olivia, 8, who is attending the second grade of Elementary School.\r\n\r\nAgustina owns a small business selling instant food consisting of rice, chicken, fish, vegetables or noodle. She puts it in a medium plastic box per portion. The food is sold out quickly as she sells it at the harbor when the ship docks.  \r\n\r\nAgustina was thinking of initiating another business: breeding pigs. Agustina loves her current business but there are times she cannot run her business, particularly during bad weather when there is no ship docked at the harbor. This situation impacts her income.\r\n\r\nAgustina used to join TLM\u2019s group lending program but she would like to get a larger loan amount through the individual lending program and therefore submitted a loan application and requested a loan of IDR 4,000,000 from TLM. Agustina will spend the loan to buy piglets and fodder. She really hopes that through the loan she can have a chance to start the business to get a better

As she started earning money with her work, she bought a dryer and gradually has been adding equipment such as dryers, brushes, and even a showcase to be able to attract new customers and satisfy the needs of the current ones.  Lately she not only offers haircuts, manicures, pedicures, etc, but also new personal accessories.  She sells beauty products and thus has been able to establish a customer base.  \r\nHer goal is to add a new chair for haircuts and increase her merchandise to continue attracting customers.\r\nNow she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first that she has had with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She will use it to buy beauty products, hair dyes, shampoo, hair treatments, etc to bring in more customers that order from her.  That is why she sees the potential success of her investment because she takes orders and buys on credit.  With a higher volume, she will get discounts.

Yanna said her most difficult challenge has been to complete her university studies and raise and educate her children. She enjoys ironing their clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is Yanna's sixth loan with Esperanza. She started her business with the first loan she received from Esperanza International, around three years ago. She plans to use this loan to purchase a glass cabinet and different pairs of shoes. This cabinet will be used to show her products. \r\n\r\nYanna wants to reinvest the profits from her business and to save because her future plan is to improve her family's living conditions, have enough money to provide a good education for her children, and send them to university. She hopes to be able to save enough money to continue improving her family's lives and to make one of her dreams come true, her dream of having a successful business. She thanks you for your support!

","en":"57-year-old Andrea is a married woman who owns a business where she sells refreshments. She also makes corncob rolls: corn batter wrapped in leaves of the same plant, prepared with the most tender and natural corn, known only to Andrea, and mixed with cheese, aniseed, etc. Through her business she has been able to support her family, which is comprised by her husband and her five children aged 36 to 44, all accomplished professionals. Although Andrea began with a small start-up business, today she makes higher sales because the business has grown larger and stronger every day. In her business, she distributes refreshments and beverages such as beer in larger quantities to stores, businesses and people who sell her products. She's currently getting ready for her busiest time, the carnival, and she's applying for a credikiva, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will stock up her business with soft drinks and beer in order for her customers - the grocery stores and the independent ones - to buy from her in larger quantities. She's preparing herself for making her highest sales of the year. Her goal is to eventually own an eatery with a lot of employees, so that they too can get an income like she did, which allowed her to provide for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":1005251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

She deals in cash and credit, both at home as well as moving through the surrounding villages to a clientele composed primarily of women.\r\n\r\nKadia hopes that with this loan, she will be able to realize a monthly profit of 7,000 FCFA, which will be subsequently reinvested in the business and enable the addition of condiments for sale.\r\n\r\nAs with the other women of the group, her goal is to increase the volume of her trade through this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1008941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase cosmetic products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bounou Markala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-18T06:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-19T06:20:02Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e8n\u00e8    Kadia     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140160},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757140},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251904},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-30T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251905},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410898},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":10409.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449035}],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T12:44:26Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Mszanski","image":1070648}},{"id":393154,"name":"Asoiva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asoiva is a married 32-year-old mother of three.

in the city of Samana. This is her 6th loan, which she will use to improve her house. She has had her business for almost five years. Since then she has paid back all her loans and expanded her business. After her last loan, which she invested in her business, Isabel realized the need to improve her home.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she talked to other members of her group and they recommended her for a Housing loan to improve her home by building another room, coating her house walls with cement and painting them. Esperanza Internacional runs a program for their good clients who are reliable in paying back their loans, who have fulfilled the commitment to grow their business and who have shown fidelity in their groups. This allows them to take out a loan to improve the structure of their house at the same time as running their business and attending their group meetings.\r\n\r\nYsabel is the mother of five children and she lives with them and her husband in their own home, which still need to be completely built (In the photo, Ysabel and her younger daughter are in the entry of their house). She will uses this loan to buy construction materials like concrete blocks, cement and others. \r\n\r\nYsabel thanks God, Esperanza Internacional and all of you for this opportunity.

groupe font le petit commerce de galettes de mil, g\u00e2teaux, articles divers de boutique (th\u00e9, bonbon, cigarette, bo\u00eetes d\u2019allumette, \u2026), tubercules, de savon etc. \nDans le but d\u2019augmenter leurs fonds de commerce, les membres du groupe  adh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019institution de microfinance  Soro Yiriwaso et sont \u00e0 leur 1er pr\u00eat solidaire.\n Madame Mawa, 1 \u00e8re  assise  \u00e0 droite, fait la pr\u00e9paration et vente de galettes de mil.  Elle compte utiliser son pr\u00eat pour acheter, 3 sacs de mil. Elle se ravitaille en mil \u00e0 la foire de Konodimini. \nPour faire de la galette, on pile le mil, le d\u00e9barrasse du son, le lave avec de l\u2019eau pour ensuite le moudre.

They are, on average, 40 years old and have 5 children each.  They live in the village of Bounou Markala, in the S\u00e9gou region (4th administrative district of Mali).  \r\nThe members of the group sell millet cakes, pastries, various grocery products (such as tea, candy, cigarettes, matchboxes etc.) as well as tubers and soap.\r\nIn order to increase their business, they have joined the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  This is their first solidarity loan.  Mawa, sitting at the far right in the photo, prepares and sells millet cakes.  She intends to use her loan to buy 3 bags of millet.  She buys millet at the Konodimini market.  To make a millet cake, millet has to be crushed, the husk is removed, then the millet is washed with water and ready to be ground.  The flour obtained is mixed with simple water and other ingredients such as sugar and yeast.  The obtained dough is then fried in oil and is ready to be sold.  Mawa sells her millet cakes from home.  She sells for retail and for cash, and sometimes on credit, to customers of both genders and all ages.  With this loan, Mawa hopes to see average monthly profits reach 15,000 CFA francs, which will be reinvested in the activity and used to provide for her family.  \r\nLike the other women of the group, her goal is to have a multifunctional mill in the village, which would make the tasks of shelling and milling grains much less tiresome.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":1008949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy millet.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bounou Markala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-02-18T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-19T09:10:03Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rokia                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadji     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mawa   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yama   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Seli     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140161},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T09:11:22Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757141},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251906},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-30T08:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251907},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-20T08:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410899},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":43719.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294449036}],"funded_date":"2012-02-18T11:38:43Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":394077,"name":"Nasiba","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Nasiba 48 letnaya vdova s odnim rebenkom.

Dossa Emmanuel left school at primary level and then learnt how to sew, an activity which he has been carrying out with passion for around 15 years and which allows him to feed his family. He also raises animals in his area as a secondary activity. Dossa Emmanuel gets his supplies in Benin. With a view to renewing his equipment by acquiring a new sewing machine and other sewing materials, he is, together with the other members of Jesugnon 12 group, requesting a third loan from Alid\u00e9. This loan will enable them to respond better to customer demand and make more money.

Nevertheless, she gladly runs the business.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, Asnat runs a piglet breeding business to earn extra income. She has been running pig breeding for years, even before running the motor taxi business. She plans to raise two more piglets to resell after six months but she needs a business loan to support her business.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, she submitted a loan application to TLM and requested a loan of IDR 3,000,000 to buy two piglets.

He lives with his wife Mercedes and their children. His principal activity is agriculture but, in addition, he is a chauffeur.\r\n\r\nJuan is a person who since childhood, has had to confront life by working every day. He lacked the opportunity to study because, together with his brothers, he headed out to the fields to work his father's agricultural plots. With the passage of time, and with arduous labor, Juan learned that only his own efforts could lead him to achieve certain goals he had outlined. While Juan worked hard as a driver and farmer, his children were growing and now he has more responsibilities, because only through hard work can he provide their daily food. At present, he has 2 agricultural parcels that he cultivates. And now he is requesting a loan to construct a pool for raising fish, to begin developing a new activity from which more income can result, and a better standard of living for himself and his family. \r\n\r\nJuan hopes that his children will have a better future than he had to suffer through. Obtaining their high school diplomas and enrolling them in higher education will be his next goals. He will work very hard to make this achievable, so that he can see his children enjoy fuller and improved lives in the future.
