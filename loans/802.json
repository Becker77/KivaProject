He knows how to manage and control his business.  Now, Javier tries to make progress on the plot of land that his father gave him, growing cacao and some fruits such as bananas and citrus fruits.  His biggest wish is to grow financially so that when he has his own family they don't want for anything.  In the future, he is planning to grow more cacao plants because he has seen that this product isn't such hard work and requires less workers, including at harvest time.\r\n\r\nThis will be Javier's second loan from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments on time.

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert, around four hours to the south of Lima, the country's capital.  It is called \"La Tierra del Sol\" (Land of the Sun) by Peruvians.  It is well known in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (a 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011) and its production of grapes, asparagus and olives.  Perhaps, above all, it is best known as being home to Peru's traditional drink 'Pisco'.  This warm and dry climate is home to our client's house and business.  In his free time, Lorenzo enjoys listening to music.  It is well known that Peru is noted for having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Lorenzo most enjoys is 'tallarin rojo'.\r\n\r\nLorenzo works as a motorcycle taxi driver.  He works around 10 hours a day and can serve up to 20 customers a day.  He believes that his business is doing well because he is very responsible when he drives his motorcycle taxi and his customers feel safe when they use his services.\r\n\r\nLorenzo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, with their support, he will be able to have maintenance work carried out on his vehicle and fix its doors.

This is a place that is known for its beautiful countryside and for its hardworking people who work in agriculture and animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nHere we meet Cruz, aged 58, who is a single mother, but who was once in a common-law marriage that produced 4 children who are now all adults.  The youngest, aged 20, still lives with her and attends the university.\r\n\r\nIn order to get ahead, Cruz works in retail trade.  Every day, she sets up a small stand in one of the streets of the canton where they allow merchants to sell their products.  There she sells all types of clothing, shoes, sneakers and other products.  The weekends are when the most people come to the city and when she makes the most sales, so on these days she needs extra help and employs someone who she pays a wage.  She has been in this business for more than 20 years, and the business has gone very well for her.

As is well known Peru is characterized as having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Alejandro enjoys a great deal is \u201cArroz Chaufa\u201d. He studied until the fifth year of secondary school and he would have liked to study to be a teacher. He is the father of a 5 year old boy who is just beginning school.\n\nAlejandro works as a motor taxi driver. He works 12 hours a day and has about 60 customers a day. He believes that his business is doing well because he provides good service and above all he is honest in his dealings.\n\nAlejandro is very grateful for Kiva loans since thanks to the support he has received he will be able to buy spare tires for his vehicle. The loan will also enable him to make necessary repairs even though it is a bit inconvenient. Thus he will be able to continue fighting to realize his great dream: \u201cHaving his own home.\u201d

in the Khoost District of western Ukraine.   He has a son and is divorced.  Andryi rents a warehouse that has been re-equipped as a blacksmith shop where he produces exclusive forged products, namely handrails, gates, furniture, and various pedestals and stands.  Andryi is a talented craftsman.  None of his products are based on patterns, instead he approaches each order individually.  Andryi has no competition. His products enjoy strong demand and he has his own client base.  He has been in this business for 6 years.  His net profit is a little more than 6,000 hryven (UAH) per month.  \r\n\r\nA loan of 10,000 hryven is necessary for Andryi to buy bar stock and additional equipment (a vise) for his blacksmith shop.  Andryi's clients know that each item he produces is painstakingly made and unique, nothing is cloned.  Because of this, everyone who has dealt with him even once greatly appreciates the quality of his work.  Andryi is devoted to his work.  He invests in it a great deal of energy and time, and he plans to develop his business and to expand it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nNote: story in Russian.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1009589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy bar stock and additional equipment (a vise) for his blacksmith shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Khoost","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T02:20:04Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andryi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":837}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.12},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.13},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":835.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263357963},{"amount":104.12,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":835.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270071283},{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":835.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277255258},{"amount":104.12,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-29T08:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":835.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283717688},{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-08T08:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":835.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287518682},{"amount":104.12,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":835.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294594618},{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":835.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301428135},{"amount":104.12,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":835.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308188423},{"amount":104.13,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":835.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315419527},{"amount":312.87,"local_amount":2503,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2510.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323024623}],"funded_date":"2012-02-20T08:07:36Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T14:26:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":393555,"name":"Weldon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Weldon is 23 years old and single.

This town is known for its traditional culture and for being a few minutes from two of the best beaches in the province, San Jacinto and San Clemente.\r\n \r\nOne of the members of this group is Yexi.  She is 34 years old and is in a common-law union from which she has four children, ages 12, 10, 9, and 5.  The three older children study, one in high school and two in elementary school.  Her husband is a farmer.\r\n\r\nLike the good wife that she is, she is getting the loan to use it with her husband in agriculture.  During the winter season they grow corn, peanuts, and certain vegetables, and then in the summer her husband works buying and selling charcoal, which he goes out to sell to certain restaurants and roast chicken places where they use this material a lot to cook the food.\r\n\r\nCurrently they want the loan to buy insecticide and fertilizer to have a good farm crop.  They need  the insecticides urgently because their crops have lots of pests and they are being harmed.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fertilizer and insecticide.  She has been with the communal bank for four cycles.  She is the president of the bank and she likes it because they have given her the loans.\r\n\r\nHer dreams are to buy a car and to have her house with all the basic services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6500,"image":{"id":1003894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He grows early vegetables, radishes, cucumbers, and tomatoes in greenhouses.  Leonid has a large piece of land, three large greenhouses (60 x 9 meters) and two separate greenhouses for seedlings.  He has been farming for eight years.  There are 100,000 hryven (UAH) invested in his farm.  Every year the cost of seed and greenhouse film comes to 36,000 hryven. \r\n\r\nLeonid needs a loan through Kiva of 10,000 hryven to buy 4,000 hryven worth of greenhouse film, 5,000 hryven worth of seed, and 1,000 hryven worth of fertilizer.  The borrowed funds will help Leonid to cover and tighten the film on his greenhouses, while it still isn't very cold, so he can begin to sow seed.  Leonid will invest the profit he earns in improving the living conditions in his home.   Not long ago, they finished a good renovation of their house and were able to install a bath and toilet.  This autumn, Leonid is planning to install good heating in the house which is why he will need to have the additional income.\r\n\r\nNote: story in Russian\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":1009591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 4,000 hryven worth of greenhouse film, 5,000 hryven worth of seed, and 1,000 hryven worth of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Vodyanoye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-19T08:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10028.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283717689}],"funded_date":"2012-02-19T17:05:01Z","paid_date":"2012-06-19T08:13:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":393575,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is the mother of seven children with the two youngest still of school age.

Her family is made up of her husband and their seven children between the ages of 7 and 28, who she dreams will become successful. She arrived in the Bicentennial City as a result of being made homeless by winter flooding and says that \"since I arrived this macro housing project has changed my life\" because she not only has housing but also a business, a stall where she sells various merchandise. As she says, \"it stuck\" and she feels the need to make it grow. This is because she has more customers and is recognized, and with each passing day she needs more money to invest and respond to her customers. \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge is to fill her customers' orders with the small amount of capital that she has.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fuller life, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8, 000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy merchandise items and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAnalyn fervently hopes that her child will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The family lives in El Porvenir, a rural hamlet whose residents work exclusively in farming and cattle breeding. The hamlet belongs to the district of Olmos, one hour from the city of Chiclayo. It is located in a developing area and electricity is the sole public utility to which it is connected so far.\r\n\r\nJhony's activity consists in transporting passengers between the villages of the area. With the savings from his job as an agricultural laborer he bought a vehicle, which he runs from Monday to Saturday from early morning to late evening. His point of departure is in the district of Olmos, where he covers the route Olmos-Porvenir-\u00d1aupe. He has done this activity for the past four years and could thus support his wife and their two school-aged children.\r\n\r\nJhony is well aware that the roads in his area are badly damaged and have taken their toll on his vehicle. He must continuously have his car serviced and buy new tires to keep it in good condition and be able to work normally.

She is married to Renato, her business partner, and the father of her three children. She and her husband, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nTeresa operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP-5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresa hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is a widow and a mother of four children. She manages her household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLigaya runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she sells used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper than brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Yolanda is requesting a PHP 26,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, also used bags and footwear. If she can roll over the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nLigaya hopes to to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business.

Her husband is Bernardo, a tricycle driver, and she is the mother of six children. Together with her husband and children, she manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nGina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked viands in her store. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGina hopes her business will grow in the coming years and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business.

She is married to Emmanuel, a driver, and is the mother of three children. Together with her husband and children, she manages the household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nNerissa oversees operations of their vehicle rental business. They have two L300 vans that they rent out to transport cargo or for people who need vehicles when transferring household goods to other places. They provide their services within the city and nearby provinces. Aside from this she also earns other income from making rugs. She earns a minimum of 5,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy spare parts and do maintenance on her vans. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNerissa hopes to have her own house someday and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

Despite how hard and tiring her work can be, she likes producing and selling farm products. Her more than 20 years in agriculture have taught her the essentials about farming in an environment of unfavorable climate and seasons with low rainfall. For that reason she now grows potatoes, peas and gladioli, because these three products give her the most satisfaction. \"Gladioli are very profitable. They can be harvested twice a year and be planted any month,\" she says. Rosalbina does not care to transport the flowers to the city of Tarma, because they are in high demand there and the merchants are ready to travel to her village and negotiate a substantial price. Now she will plant gladioli and expects them to be ready in May, because May is one of the months with the highest flower prices.\r\n\r\nThis loan would be her thirteenth with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma. She gives her word to be punctual with paying the installments. She is grateful and happy with her communal bank \"La Libertad de Huaripampa\" (the freedom of Huaripampa) because of the teamwork.

In the future, he plans to diversify his crops.  \r\n\r\nWith the loan he is requesting, he wants to continue maintaining his pineapple crops.  Thanks to Afodenic with his Kiva loan, he has been able to increase production, but he was affected by the market price, which dropped almost 50% below the normal price.  This is because the market was flooded with fruits such as mandarins, melons, oranges, and watermelons.  He hopes that after his second harvest, the price will stabilize and he can earn more profits.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":1005574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2012-02-19T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2012-03-20T15:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliz Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2013-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T10:06:53Z","rounded_local_amount":18481.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346991054}],"funded_date":"2012-02-28T02:11:48Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T10:06:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":393903,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a mother and a farmer in Kitale, Western Kenya where she lives with her family of 6 children, all adults save for the last born who is still schooling.

Zenobia is a woman who is very talented in household duties as well as in work, where she grows coffee on her parcel of land located an hour from her house. She tells us furthermore that to advance in her work she goes to live on her agricultural parcel with all her family, because it is tiring to go up there every day. For this reason, she does her shopping on Sundays for the week, and then she heads to work early in the morning on Mondays, then returning to her house on Saturday afternoons after work. In this way Zenobia works with the sole goal of advancing. In the near future she wants to open a grocery store, but her house is still not furnished. For that reason, she wants to put a floor in her house.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with the work that she does, because up to now it has gone very well for her.

He notes that when these small animals are young, he becomes so fond of them that he feels bad when they are taken off. He believes that the business is going well because he is raising the small animals following hygienic standards and his customers feel assured by that.\r\n\r\nCurrently Benjamin is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to purchase guinea pigs, especially females. Since these little animals reproduce rapidly this will enable him to have more to sell.

Therefore her hours are flexible, since her clients also call to inquire of her availability Monday through Sunday. \r\n\r\nShe purchases her supplies and the materials she needs from a specialty distributor of hair salon products where she receives discounts due to her being a long-time customer. With the loan she will purchase a hair-cutting tool. One of her goals is to have a shop established in her home's patio area in order to set up a beauty salon. She comments that she has already applied for a subsidy for the expansion of her home, and so will be able to bring her project to fruition quite soon. \r\n\r\nTeresa lives with her husband and two children who are eight and three years old. One of her dreams of a personal nature is to have her salon set up, since by doing so she will be able to offer her family a better quality of life. She is very happy and thankful for the opportunity Fondo Esperanza is giving her, since it has allowed her to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nLinares is an important urban center in the Maule region, located in the country's central zone.

It is worth noting that it is one of the most densely populated communes in the country.  It's population growth began with the arrival of immigrants from other areas of the country looking for better opportunities in the 60s and 70s.  This gave rise to significant neighborhoods that are still around, such as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caro, Santa Adriana, and Lo

Currently she is requesting a Kiva loan, initial financing done by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to buy raw materials and goods in large volumes, a grill larger than the one she uses, and a heated display case. This infrastructure will allow her to serve more customers than she is able to now, and she will also get discounts for buying larger quantities - all of which supports the success of her investment.

","en":"Salvador, 51, is the owner of a dessert shop, a trade that he learned from a friend. He began making desserts for people that worked for his relatives, neighbors and friends. That's how he became known and started increasing his business until he hired two employees. He makes sales door to door. His business has had challenges, like being robbed and losing a lot of capital. But the business has also given him and his family a lot of joy, because it has helped their well-being. His family is made up of his wife and two children, ages 27 and 29. \r\n\r\nCurrently he is really eager to grow, because every day he has more customers and he doesn't have enough capital to meet the demand. For that reason he is getting a Kiva loan, his first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use it to buy ingredients and work equipment so he can increase his technical infrastructure and also his customer coverage.

She lives in the city of Mala, a city featuring a prominent geographical area called \u201cLos Platanales\u201d (The Banana Plantations) in days of old consisting as humid and salty, where abundant water emerged to the surface from the subsoil owing to the presence of a water table situated at a shallow depth, that made it advantageous for growing fruit such as Male\u00f1o bananas and grapevines. There were in this place many large \u201ctotorales\u201d (ponds with grass and reeds) and little pools formed by water that surfaced from the subsoil. The presence of the subterranean water in the area of Los Platanales permitted the formation of many channels or outflows that in years past harbored a great variety of hydrobiological species, now almost disappeared, owing to the irrational and wrongful exploitation of water. \r\n\r\nAs a good Peruvian Jessica loves food and one of the dishes that she likes a lot is tasty grilled chicken.\r\n\r\nJessica works in her business selling toys and stories for children, working about 8 hours per day and she can serve up to 30 customers a day. She likes it very much and tells us that sometimes she watches the programs for children in order to know the games she can bring to offer her clients. She believes that her business is doing well because she is very friendly with her customers and above all with the children because at their age they are very restless.\r\n\r\nCurrently Jessica is very grateful with the Kiva loans and with your support she will be able to buy lunch boxes, accessories and school supplies to offer in her business as school season is going to begin and this will allow her to increase her income and to continue fighting to fulfill her big dream of having a bookstore bazaar.

The group is named after the community where it is located, in Hato Mayor city, in the eastern part of the country. Hato Mayor is a fairly mountainous region where the principal industry is agriculture.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a mother of four children and they live together with her and their father. She said that her most difficult challenge has been to create her business. In the past it was very difficult, because she did not have enough money to start one up, but after she found Esperanza and took out her loans, she was able (like other members in this group) to open her business.\r\n\r\nCarmen is excited about her thirteenth loan with Esperanza. After almost seven years in her business, she has expanded her little butcher shop into a bigger one, with more quantity of meats to supply more clients. With this loan she will increase her inventory and make even bigger sales.

Therefore she has two occupations. She works as a secretary in one of Ijevan\u2019s organizations, and she also runs her own business. She sells clothes directly from her house. This fact allows her to save on stall rent. Every month she buys merchandise from wholesale markets in Yerevan. Anna makes an emphasis on children's clothes, as she says that those goods are always in popular demand. She has a lot of regular customers, and she knows their tastes very well, so she tries to buy merchandise according to their requirements.\r\n  \r\nHer business allows her to keep her small family, and she intends to develop her trading. She needs a 500,000 AMD loan to buy various spring clothes, house slippers, baby sets, etc. to resell. This is Anna's second loan from Nor Horizon.

","en":"56-year-old Pedro lives with his wife and has six children who are between 11 and 30 years of age.  Five years ago, Pedro was experiencing a very difficult financial situation.  He worked as a builder but was not finding work.  He discussed with his wife the idea of making thongs (flip-flops) to sell and thereby make money.  She supported this idea and so Pedro borrowed money from a friend, bought raw materials and made a few pairs of sandals which made him a small amount of money.  His customers liked his products and started to recommend him.  His customer base started to grow and he looked closely at the feet of people as they passed by, adding ideas to his designs.  With the support of his wife and especially thanks to his loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Pedro managed to increase his working capital, grow his business and stabilize it.  He has received two loans from this organization who have helped him for three years.  Pedro would like to grow his business even further and is requesting a Kiva loan to buy raw materials and supplies so that he can make his products.  He will buy foam, soles, adhesive, lining, heels etc.  His goal for the future is to have sales premises where he can display his products.  He would also like to buy more specialized machinery, which would make his production more efficient, and continue improving his family's well-being."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":1006475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials and supplies for making his products.
